```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory access is coalesced
// Employ block-level parallelism for shared memory initialization
// Use grid-stride loops to optimize global memory access patterns
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized to reduce contention
```
