```
// Use shared memory to increase data reuse and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Perform bounds checks during shared memory loading to prevent illegal memory access
// Unroll inner computation loop to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads synchronize after loading data into shared memory
// Optimize matrix dimensions to ensure they are multiples of TILE_WIDTH for efficient tiling
