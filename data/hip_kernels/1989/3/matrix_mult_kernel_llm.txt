```
// Consider using shared memory to cache common data for faster access
// Check alignment to ensure optimal coalesced memory access
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform branch paths
// Evaluate using loop unrolling for better performance
// Use constants or restrict qualifiers to aid compiler optimizations
