```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store d_coordinates data within each block to reduce global memory access.
// Avoid recomputing min and max in the loop; compute them before entering the loop to minimize operations.
// Consider unrolling the inner loop to improve performance by reducing loop control overhead.
// Use half warp memory transactions for d_g and d_b accesses to increase memory throughput.
// Ensure aligned memory access for d_g, d_b, and d_r_output to optimize global memory bandwidth.
