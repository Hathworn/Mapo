```
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to store intermediate histogram data to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration (threads per block) for better occupancy
// Check if replacing atomic operations with warp-level primitives improves performance
