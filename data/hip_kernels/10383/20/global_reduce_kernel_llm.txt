```c
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses when loading to shared memory
// Ensure proper memory synchronization to prevent race conditions
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() to improve performance
// Consider unrolling the loop to reduce loop overhead
```
