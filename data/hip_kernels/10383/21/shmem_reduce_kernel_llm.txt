```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns when loading d_in into shared memory for improved performance.
// Use __restrict__ to pointers d_out and d_in for better compiler optimizations and memory access.
// Ensure memory alignment of shared memory allocations and accesses for optimal load/store efficiency.
// Experiment with different shared memory sizes and block dimensions to find the best configuration.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() as excessive use can reduce performance; ensure it's necessary before adding.
