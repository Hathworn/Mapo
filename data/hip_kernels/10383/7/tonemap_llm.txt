```cpp
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing conditional statements
// Precompute constant values outside the kernel if possible
// Analyze data locality to enhance cache usage
// Avoid redundant memory fetches by hoisting invariant calculations
