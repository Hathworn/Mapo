```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for d_in to improve global memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling in the shared_reduce function for further optimization
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls by combining steps when possible
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of shared memory
// Optimize the use of shared memory by limiting its allocation to only what's necessary
// Ensure that the last thread writes d_out_shared outside conditional branches, if possible
