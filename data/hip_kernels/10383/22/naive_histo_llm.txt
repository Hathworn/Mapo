```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory in a coalesced manner
// Use atomic operations in shared memory to improve performance
// Minimize global memory atomic operations by aggregating in shared memory first
// Consider optimizing shared memory access pattern for better performance
