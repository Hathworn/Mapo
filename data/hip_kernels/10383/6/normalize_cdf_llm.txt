```
// Use shared memory to cache parts of d_input_cdf to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring d_input_cdf and d_output_cdf are accessed with consecutive threads.
// Consider using multiple streams or kernel launches to overlap computation and memory transfers for better performance.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve throughput on the GPU.
// Minimize the use of local variables to reduce register pressure.
