// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Ensure initialization of shared memory is performed by one thread to avoid race conditions
// Utilize atomicMax to safely perform reduction in shared memory
// Use atomic operations to update global memory, reducing false sharing and memory contention
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads to correctly aggregate results
