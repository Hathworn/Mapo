```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations
// Explore the use of shared memory to cache input data if reused across threads
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditional statements
// Optimize the workload balance to prevent idle threads within a block
