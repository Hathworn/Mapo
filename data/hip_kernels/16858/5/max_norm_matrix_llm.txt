```
// Consider optimizing memory access by coalescing global reads from mat1
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global atomic operations
// Try using warp-level primitives to minimize synchronization overhead
// Explore double-buffering techniques for efficient shared memory usage
// Ensure bank conflict-free access patterns in shared memory
// Utilize the first thread of the block more effectively for final computations
