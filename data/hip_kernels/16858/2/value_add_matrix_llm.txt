```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Use shared memory if further temporal locality improvements are needed
// Consider loop unrolling for potential performance gains
// Balance grid and block dimensions to match the GPU architecture for optimal utilization
// Minimize the use of global memory by optimizing memory transactions
