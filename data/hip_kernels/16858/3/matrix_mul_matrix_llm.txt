```
// Consider using larger tiles to increase data reuse and decrease global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting the memory layout for better performance.
// Check if shared memory usage can be optimized to further reduce bank conflicts.
// Evaluate using loop unrolling within the computation loop to enhance throughput.
// Consider double buffering technique to hide memory latency during tiled matrix multiplication.
// Adjust block size to maximize occupancy and balance computation with memory access.
