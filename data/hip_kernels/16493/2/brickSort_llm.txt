// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency.
// Align data access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses for better bandwidth utilization.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously if shared memory is implemented to ensure data consistency between threads.
// Check if loop unrolling can be beneficial in reducing instruction overhead when arrays processed are large.
