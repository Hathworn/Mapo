```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Favor shared memory over global memory where possible for faster access
// Align data structures to optimal sizes to reduce memory access overhead
// Leverage constant memory for variables that remain the same across threads
```
