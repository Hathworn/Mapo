// Consider coalesced memory access for the u and v arrays to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for atomicAdd operations to reduce global memory contention.
// Minimize use of atomic operations if possible by reorganizing computation to use more local or shared memory.
// Precompute flow_row_offset and image_row_offset outside of loops if used repeatedly to save computational overhead.
