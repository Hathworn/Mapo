```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loc_ to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Consider aligning data structures to prevent misaligned memory accesses.
// Leverage shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Explore using vectorized types for loc_ such as int2 for potential speedup.
// Opt for __ldg() intrinsic for reading loc_ if the data will be read multiple times and doesn't change.
