// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses to memory boundaries
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the number of loop control instructions
// Optimize grid and block size for better occupancy and load balancing
