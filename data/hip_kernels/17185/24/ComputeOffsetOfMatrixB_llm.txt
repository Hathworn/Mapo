```
// Use shared memory to cache row_sum values to reduce global memory access.
// Avoid branching in the loop by computing the initial offset outside the loop.
// Move invariant calculations outside the loop where possible to enhance performance.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead and increase throughput.
