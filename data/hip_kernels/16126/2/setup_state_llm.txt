// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transactions
// Avoid bank conflicts by properly distributing data across shared memory banks
// Ensure memory accesses are contiguous to optimize memory bandwidth utilization
