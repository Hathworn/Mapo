```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within the kernel.
// Use texture memory for read-only data with spatial locality.
// Ensure memory coalescing in accessing idata array to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branching within warps by aligning execution paths.
