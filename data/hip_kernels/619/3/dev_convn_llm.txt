```
// Improved memory access pattern: coalesced access for idata
// Use __shared__ memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure stride-based access for idata to exploit memory coalescing
// Unrolled loop for better performance to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput
// Increase thread block size to maximize resource utilization and parallelism
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() before processing shared memory
// Check boundary conditions to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming for further optimization
