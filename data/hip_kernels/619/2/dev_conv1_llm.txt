```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory in the kernel.
// Consider increasing the size of shared memory to avoid reloading data from global memory.
// Use constant memory for filter coefficients to benefit from caching.
// Ensure thread blocks are optimally sized for the hardware.
// Use loop unrolling to increase performance by reducing overhead.
// Verify memory access patterns are coalesced to optimize global memory bandwidth.
