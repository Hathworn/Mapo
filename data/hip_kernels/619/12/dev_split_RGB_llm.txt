```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for optimal coalesced memory access.
// Evaluate kernel grid and block size for best utilization of computational resources.
// Aim to minimize branching within the kernel function for improved performance.
// Make use of the __restrict__ qualifier for pointers in kernels to aid compiler optimizations.
