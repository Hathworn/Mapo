```
// Use register and shared memory to minimize global memory access and latency.
// Consider optimizing block and thread allocation for efficient load balancing.
// Prefetch data where possible to reduce access overhead.
// Use warp-level primitives for efficient thread synchronization.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize asynchronous memory transfers for overlapping data movement and computation.
// Examine memory bank conflicts and align data to utilize burst transfers.
// Reassess the compiler optimization flags for the kernel to fine-tune performance.
