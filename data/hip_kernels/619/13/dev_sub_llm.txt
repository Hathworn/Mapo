```
// Leverage constant memory for frequent access patterns
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Implement memory coalescing to optimize global memory access
// Use loop unrolling to reduce branch instructions and improve throughput
// Consider warp-level operations to reduce divergence within warps
// Optimize grid/block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize register pressure
