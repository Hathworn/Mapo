// Consider using shared memory to cache data elements that are accessed multiple times within the kernel
// Implement coalesced access patterns to maximize memory throughput
// Use float4 or float2 types in data processing to minimize the number of memory transactions
// Optimize thread block and grid size for maximum occupancy and warp efficiency
