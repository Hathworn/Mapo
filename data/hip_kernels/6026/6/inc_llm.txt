```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Ensure optimal block and grid size to fully utilize GPU cores
// Use shared memory if there are frequent accesses to the same data
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Avoid warp divergence for better performance
