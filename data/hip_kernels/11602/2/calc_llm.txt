```
// Ensure coalesced memory access while loading d_D into shared memory.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts during access.
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for read-only cache access if d_D is not modified.
// Consider double buffering technique for overlapping computation and data transfer.
// Perform loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory access while storing results back to d_D.
// Avoid unnecessary shared memory usage and computation if data is reusable.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy and utilize GPU resources efficiently.
