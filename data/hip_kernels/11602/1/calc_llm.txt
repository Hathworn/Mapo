```
// Use coalesced memory access to optimize global memory reads and writes
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy and resource utilization
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for operations within fixed iteration counts
// Use warp-level synchronization if possible to reduce synchronization overhead
