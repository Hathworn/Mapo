// Consider exploring the use of warp shuffle instructions to enhance memory access patterns in binarySearchForMultinomial.
// Shared memory usage might be optimized further by reducing extraneous memory barriers.
// Look into minimizing bank conflicts in the shared memory accesses for improved performance.
// If categories exceed the shared memory limit, consider dynamic allocation or multiple kernel launches.
