```
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed global memory values for stride.
// Avoid recalculating index_stride_dim multiple times by storing it in a register.
// Reduce memory transactions by accessing global memory coalesced when updating tensor values.
// For each loop iteration, avoid redundant memory reads by storing index[i] to a local variable.
