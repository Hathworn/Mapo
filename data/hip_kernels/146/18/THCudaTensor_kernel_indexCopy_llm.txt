// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for res_stride
// Preload index values into registers or shared memory to reduce access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access with warp size
// Investigate possible loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Evaluate use of atomic operations if concurrent writes are an issue
