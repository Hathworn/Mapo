// Use shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory access.
// Unroll loops to reduce the number of loop iterations and improve performance.
// Use warp-level primitive operations to efficiently perform reductions.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have reached the same execution point.
