```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory allocation for dist arrays.
// Utilize shared memory to cache normDistPrefixSum for faster access within warps.
// Minimize use of global memory transactions by optimizing memory access patterns.
// Leverage warp-level primitives to reduce redundant computation across threads.
