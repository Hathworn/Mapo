```
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use parallel reduction to compute the norm efficiently
// Employ warp shuffle-based reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Use atomic operations for accurate accumulation of partial results
// Apply conditional renormalization to avoid unnecessary operations
// Minimize divergent branches by aligning conditions within warps
