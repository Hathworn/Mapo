```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data.
// Consider using texture or surface memory for better cached access patterns.
// Align data structures to ensure memory coalescing and avoid bank conflicts.
// Increase vectorization factors if bandwidth allows for more efficient memory utilization.
// Ensure kernel launch parameters optimize occupancy while balancing warp utilization.
// Evaluate potential benefits of latency hiding through concurrent kernel execution.
