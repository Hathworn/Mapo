```c
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Align memory access patterns to utilize cache efficiently
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data accessing
// Ensure that atomic operations do not cause significant performance bottlenecks
