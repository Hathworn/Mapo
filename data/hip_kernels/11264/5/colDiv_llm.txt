```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing memory in a linear and consecutive manner
// Assign more work to each thread to hide memory latency
// Check for potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated operations within threads
