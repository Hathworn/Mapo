```
// Consider coalescing memory access for array 'a' by using row-major access pattern.
// Use shared memory to load array 'b' if it is used by multiple threads to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Align access patterns with warp sizes to maximize the use of memory caches.
// Ensure memory alignment for 'a', 'b', and 'c' to improve access speed.
// Use loop unrolling if possible to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
