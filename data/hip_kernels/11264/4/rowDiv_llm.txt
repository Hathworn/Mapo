```cpp
// Align data access to coalesce global memory access
// Ensure 'a' and 'b' are accessed in a memory-efficient pattern
// Consider loading 'b[blockIdx.x]' into shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better warp utilization
// Minimize unnecessary global memory accesses for better performance
// Assess the potential benefits of using float4 where applicable
