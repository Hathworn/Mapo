```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure kernel launch configuration (block size and grid size) is optimized for the GPU architecture used.
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance, respecting the hardware limitations.
// Use shared memory if necessary to reduce global memory accesses for improved performance.
// Ensure to check for memory bank conflicts if shared memory is utilized.
// Validate if writing once to const_ptr within the kernel is optimal or if changes outside the kernel are needed.
