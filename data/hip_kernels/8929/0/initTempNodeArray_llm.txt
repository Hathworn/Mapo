```
// Consider using shared memory to cache recently accessed data, reducing global memory access.
// Employ coalesced global memory access by reorganizing data structures if possible.
// Use warp-level primitives for better control of thread execution and reduction of divergence.
// Minimize use of conditional statements where possible to enhance warp efficiency.
// Precompute values outside of the kernel if they are constant across threads to save computations.
