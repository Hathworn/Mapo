```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for target_IDArray and target_indexArray
// Investigate the use of shared memory for cellSizeArray to reduce global memory traffic
// Analyze potential bank conflicts when accessing qIDArray and qIndexArray
// Ensure data alignment for more efficient memory access patterns
// Explore additional loop unrolling techniques for the main for loop
// Assess if using texture memory could benefit read-heavy arrays such as indexArray
