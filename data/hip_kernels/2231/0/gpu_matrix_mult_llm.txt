// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate the balance between the number of registers and shared memory used to optimize performance
// Analyze divergent branches due to boundary checks and minimize divergence
