// Consider aligning accesses to memory using coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions when loading tiles.
// Consider loop unrolling in inner multiplication loop for further performance improvements.
