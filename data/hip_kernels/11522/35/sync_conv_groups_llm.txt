```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize global memory transactions.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
// Evaluate warp-level primitives to reduce divergence and improve synchronization.
// Align data structures to memory boundary for optimal memory access patterns.
// Investigate memory bank conflicts to ensure efficient use of shared memory.
