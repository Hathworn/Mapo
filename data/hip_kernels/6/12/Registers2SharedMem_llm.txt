```cpp
// Ensure shared memory accesses are coalesced to improve global memory throughput
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts and improve performance
// Minimize memory accesses by using registers effectively
// Avoid control flow divergence within warps to maximize execution efficiency
