```
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for matrixC write operations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for matrixA and matrixB
// Consider using persistent threads to reduce kernel launch overhead for larger matrices
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts for sh_MatrixA and sh_MatrixB
// Ensure boundary checks are correct to prevent invalid memory accesses
