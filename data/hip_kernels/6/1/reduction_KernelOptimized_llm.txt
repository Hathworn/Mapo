```
// Consider using coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous data.
// Avoid bank conflicts by using shared memory efficiently.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier on pointers to help the compiler with optimizations.
// Minimize global memory access by making use of shared memory effectively.
// Consider loop unrolling for the reduction step to optimize performance.
