```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for bodyPos and bodySpeed to optimize memory bandwidth
// Ensure the use of __restrict__ qualifier for bodyPos and bodySpeed to improve memory access patterns
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access by aligning data properly
// Use float4 for both position and speed to increase data throughput
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage of elementPosMass if it leads to better performance
// Leverage loop unrolling if applicable to enhance parallel execution
