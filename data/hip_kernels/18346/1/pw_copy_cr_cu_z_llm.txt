```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Avoid unnecessary operations inside the loop to ensure better performance
// Consider using shared memory if access patterns are repetitive and data can be reused
// If possible, eliminate any divergence in control flow to ensure warp efficiency
