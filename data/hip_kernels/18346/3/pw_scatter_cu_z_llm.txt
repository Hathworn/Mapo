// Ensure memory accesses are efficiently coalesced
// Consider using shared memory for repeated accesses to the same data
// Optimize by minimizing bank conflicts
// Reuse computed indices to reduce redundant calculations
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider prefetching data to improve latency
