```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access.
// Use texture memory for read-only data to speed up access and save bandwidth.
// Ensure memory coalescing by structuring data for aligned access.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better utilization of hardware resources.
// Attempt loop unrolling to minimize overhead and improve the pipeline efficiency.
