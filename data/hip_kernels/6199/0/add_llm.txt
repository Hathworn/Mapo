```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory if data is reused
// Coalesce memory accesses to minimize global memory transactions
// Ensure the use of warp-level operations for better performance
// Consider using vectorized operations for large arrays
// Use appropriate block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
