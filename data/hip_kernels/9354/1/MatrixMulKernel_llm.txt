```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Perform boundary checks before accessing global memory to avoid out-of-bounds access
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is used after loading data into shared memory to synchronize threads
// Limit the use of __syncthreads() to only necessary points to reduce overhead
