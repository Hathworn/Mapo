```
// Consider using shared memory if there is data reuse among threads
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data in memory
// Explore vectorized memory operations for double types
// Minimize global memory accesses by utilizing registers
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring if conditions are uniform across threads
```
