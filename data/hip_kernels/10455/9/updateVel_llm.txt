```
// Use shared memory to coalesce global memory accesses for better performance.
// Consider using float4 instead of float2 to increase bandwidth efficiency.
// Align data structures to 128-bit boundaries to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use the __restrict__ qualifier to inform the compiler about non-overlapping data for better optimization.
