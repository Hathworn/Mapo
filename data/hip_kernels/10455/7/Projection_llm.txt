// Consider prefetching data into shared memory for better memory access patterns
// Use shared memory for coalesced global memory access (optional, if beneficial)
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Align data accesses with warp boundaries for optimal performance
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only cache where applicable
