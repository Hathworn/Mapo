// Consider using shared memory to store neighboring velocities for blocks to reduce global memory access
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when loading oldVel and writing to newVel for better performance
// Minimize the computation of indexes inside the kernel to reduce unnecessary arithmetic operations
// Check the possibility of loop unrolling for accessing neighboring velocities to enhance throughput
