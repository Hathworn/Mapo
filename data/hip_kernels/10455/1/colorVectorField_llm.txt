```
// Use shared memory to store parts of colorMap for better access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring data structures are accessed in a strided fashion
// Avoid branching where possible in the color assignment logic
// Consider using texture memory for colorMap if access patterns benefit from spatial locality
