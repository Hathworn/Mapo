```
// Consider using shared memory to load tile data for N to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align padded dimension calculations (paddedH and paddedW) for coalesced memory access.
// Further unroll loops within the kernel to increase parallelism and reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure memory accesses for M are coalesced to improve performance.
// Use warp shuffle instructions to further reduce inter-thread communication overhead.
