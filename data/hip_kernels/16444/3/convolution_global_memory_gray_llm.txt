```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access
// Use shared memory effectively for caching frequently accessed data
// Reduce unnecessary global memory accesses by maximizing shared memory use
// Store intermediate results in registers to minimize shared memory transactions
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
