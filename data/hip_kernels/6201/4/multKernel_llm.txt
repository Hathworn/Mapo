// Use shared memory to cache data from global memory for faster access
// Minimize memory transactions by using coalesced memory access patterns
// Optimize memory access by ensuring aligned memory access for improved performance
// Consider using warp-centric programming to maximize parallel efficiency
// Evaluate potential for loop unrolling if applicable for further performance gains
