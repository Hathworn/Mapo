```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by making arrays continuous in memory
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use loop unrolling if kernel work size is sufficient
// Optimize for occupancy by adjusting block and grid dimensions
// Minimize register usage by optimizing arithmetic operations
```
