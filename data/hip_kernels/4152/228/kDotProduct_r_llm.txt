```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a contiguous manner
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Employ loop unrolling to improve memory access patterns
// Perform reduction in shared memory to leverage high bandwidth
// Utilize warp shuffle techniques for efficient intra-warp reduction
// Use volatile pointers for final warp reduction to prevent caching
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
