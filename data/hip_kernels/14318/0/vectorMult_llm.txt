```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by using contiguous input arrays.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Further unroll the loop for better instruction level parallelism.
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching if supported by the target architecture.
// Validate that grid and block dimensions are optimal for the hardware.
