```cpp
// Use shared memory for caching frequently accessed data
// Align data accesses to coalesce global memory transactions
// Minimize branch divergence within the kernel
// Prefer using __syncthreads() only when necessary to avoid synchronization overhead
// Consider increasing block size to improve occupancy, but ensure it does not exceed shared memory per block limit
```
