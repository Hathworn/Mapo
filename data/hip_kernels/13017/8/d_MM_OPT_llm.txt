// Reduce global memory accesses by loading data into shared memory.
// Use shared memory tiles to optimize memory access patterns.
// Avoid out-of-bounds accesses by checking array indices.
// Ensure synchronization between threads using __syncthreads() before computations.
// Minimize redundant calculations by computing within shared memory.
