```
// Potentially unroll the inner loop over 'k' to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Consider reducing shared memory bank conflicts by altering data access patterns
// Utilize warp-level primitives to optimize synchronization overhead
// Prefetch next tile data into shared memory before finishing the current computation
// Balance workload more efficiently by re-evaluating the grid and block dimensions
