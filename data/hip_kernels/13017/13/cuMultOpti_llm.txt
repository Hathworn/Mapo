```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for loading data into shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory operations
// Optimize memory access by checking boundary conditions before accessing arrays
// Ensure proper block and thread indices for efficient memory utilization
