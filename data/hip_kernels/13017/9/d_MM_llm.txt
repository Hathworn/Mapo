```
// Unroll the loop to reduce the loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory using continuous threads in each warp
// Consider using shared memory to store the matrix tiles for further optimization
// Optimize the thread block dimensions to match the GPU architecture for better occupancy
