// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance
// Consider using shared memory if further memory access patterns can be optimized
// Evaluate the block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
// Ensure proper alignment of memory to avoid unaligned memory access penalties
