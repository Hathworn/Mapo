```
// Consider memory coalescing for memory access optimization
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring all threads follow similar paths
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
// Balance workloads among threads to prevent idle threads
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for better resource utilization
