```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Ensure that all threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threads in a warp follow a similar execution path
// Utilize shared memory for repeated access data to reduce global memory loads
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find an optimal configuration
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to enable more optimization by the compiler
// Reduce the use of if statements to minimize execution path divergence
