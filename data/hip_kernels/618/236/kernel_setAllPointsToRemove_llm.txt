// Optimization: Ensure coalesced memory access by having consecutive threads accessing consecutive memory locations
// Optimization: Minimize divergent branches within the loop to enhance warp efficiency
// Optimization: Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy and memory throughput
