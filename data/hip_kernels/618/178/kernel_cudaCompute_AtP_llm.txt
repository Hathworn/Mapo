```
// Consider using shared memory to store portions of d_A or d_P for faster access
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Explore adjusting block size and grid size for better occupancy
// Investigate use of warp-level primitives to reduce redundant calculations
// Apply double buffering technique if possible to hide memory latency
