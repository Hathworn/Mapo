```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory where applicable to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize memory divergence by optimizing warp execution paths
// Ensure data alignment for efficient memory transactions
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data
```
