// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access contiguous data
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce uncoalesced accesses
// Ensure the number of blocks is enough to keep the GPU fully utilized
