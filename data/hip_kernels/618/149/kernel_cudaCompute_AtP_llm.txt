```
// Ensure each thread processes multiple elements for better utilization of resources
// Pre-compute memory access indices for improved coalesced memory access
// Consider using shared memory to cache data locally and reduce global memory access
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations if needed
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for better performance
