```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if applicable to allow for better compiler optimization
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Check if texture memory can be utilized for read-only data
