```
// Consider using shared memory if additional data access is needed
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for any data transactions
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Use volatile keyword cautiously, as it may inhibit certain compiler optimizations
// Analyze occupancy to ensure maximum thread usage within blocks
