```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring global memory accesses are contiguous
// Minimize the number of accesses to global memory by using shared memory effectively
// Use texture memory to take advantage of its caching mechanism for spatial locality
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Optimize shared memory usage to fit within the specified limit for a block
