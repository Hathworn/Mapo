// Consider coalesced access patterns for d_nearest_neighbour_indexes for better memory throughput
// Ensure d_temp_double_mem writes are coalesced to improve memory efficiency
// Evaluate use of shared memory if data reuse occurs to minimize global memory access
// Minimize divergence in the use of if() statements to enhance branch prediction
