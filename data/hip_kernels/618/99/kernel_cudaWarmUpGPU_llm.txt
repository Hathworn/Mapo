```c
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns for optimal memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Use vectorized data types to load/store multiple data elements at a time.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations if not strictly necessary as they can serialize execution.
// Ensure threads within a warp access consecutive memory addresses to maximize cache efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques within the kernel to enhance throughput.
