```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring d_nn and nearest_neighbour_indexes are contiguous in memory
// Use shared memory to cache nearest_neighbour_indexes if it is accessed multiple times by threads in a block
// Minimize divergence by accessing nearest_neighbour_indexes with offsets that align with memory access patterns
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for occupancy to maximize the number of active warps
// Experiment with loop unrolling if applicable to improve access patterns and utilize more registers
