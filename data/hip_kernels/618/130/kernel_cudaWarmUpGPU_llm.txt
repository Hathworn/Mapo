// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better data handling and synchronization
// Minimize branch divergence by organizing code to reduce conditional statements
// Coalesce global memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts by carefully aligning shared memory usage
