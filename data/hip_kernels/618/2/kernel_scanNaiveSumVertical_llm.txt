// Move memory accesses to shared memory for reduced latency
// Consider using coalesced memory access for optimal performance
// Optimize memory access patterns for better cache utilization
// Ensure memory reads are aligned for best performance
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure threads synchronize correctly
