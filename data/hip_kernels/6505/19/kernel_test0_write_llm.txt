```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths
// Evaluate memory alignment and padding for better performance
