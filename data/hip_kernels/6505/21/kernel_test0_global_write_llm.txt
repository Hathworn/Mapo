```
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing.
// Ensure accesses fall within valid memory range to prevent overflow.
// Use warp-level primitives to enhance performance on pattern shifts.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize memory patterns to avoid bank conflicts.
