```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for ptr to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize pattern shifts and bit-masking for better computation efficiency.
// Ensure memory accesses are within bounds to avoid memory access violations.
// Evaluate using __syncthreads() if shared memory is utilized later.
```
