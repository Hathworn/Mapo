```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Prefetch data into shared memory to improve coalescing and reduce memory stalls
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced by aligning data loads and stores
// Consider adjusting the block size for optimal shared memory usage and occupancy
// Aim to minimize warp divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths within warps
// Use appropriate synchronization primitives to coordinate shared memory access
