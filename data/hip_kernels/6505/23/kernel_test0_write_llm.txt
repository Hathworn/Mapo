```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Avoid branching where possible to maintain consistent execution paths for threads.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if the same data is accessed by multiple threads.
// Optimize access patterns to exploit memory access coalescing and reduce the warp divergence.
// Align memory accesses to the size of the data type for better performance.
// Minimize the use of casting and pointer arithmetic in the kernel to avoid potential inefficiencies.
