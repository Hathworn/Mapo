// Prioritize reducing memory divergence by ensuring threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize division operations to improve performance, especially in loops.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if data re-use is possible within the kernel.
// Consider using constant memory for frequently accessed variables like MOD_SZ, p1, and p2.
