```
// Coalesce global memory loads by accessing sequentially for improved performance.
// Precompute frequent expressions to reduce redundant computations.
// Use __forceinline__ for the device function to suggest compiler optimization.
// Perform boundary checks before atomic operations to avoid unnecessary work.
// Leverage float precision for computations to improve performance where possible.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access by aligning data properly.
