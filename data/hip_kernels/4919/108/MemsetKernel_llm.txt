```
// Use cooperative grid-stride loop for improved memory access pattern
// This pattern allows threads to work more efficiently across the grid dimensions
// Helps minimize idling and maximize occupancy by keeping threads busy
// Stride pattern helps in coalesced memory access, reducing bank conflicts
// Ensure memory access is aligned for better performance
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory fetches
// Consider adjusting block and grid dimensions to maximize performance on specific hardware
