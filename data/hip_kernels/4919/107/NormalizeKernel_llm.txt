```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for normalization_factor to reduce global memory access
// Use __ldg() for normalization_factor to leverage read-only data cache
// Ensure coalesced memory access by making s a multiple of the warp size if possible
// Minimize branching by using warp-level primitives for boundary checks
// Unroll loops if applicable to enhance performance
