// Use shared memory to minimize redundant accesses to global memory.
// Coalesce global memory access by reorganizing data layout or thread indexing.
// Consider using texture or surface memory for `src` if data exhibits spatial locality.
// Cache values like `flow_row_offset` and `image_row_offset` in registers to reduce global memory access.
// Merge branch condition checks into warp-wide predication where appropriate.
