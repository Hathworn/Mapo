// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking alignment and data structure
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and throughput
// Utilize warp-level primitives if applicable to reduce divergence
// Ensure values fit within cache to minimize global memory access
