```
// Consider using memory coalescing by aligning data structures in memory.
// Ensure shared memory accesses are coalesced for better memory throughput.
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Use float2 to load/store to reduce memory transactions, if applicable.
// Optimize shared memory usage patterns to prevent bank conflicts.
// Ensure global memory access patterns are contiguous and coalesced.
