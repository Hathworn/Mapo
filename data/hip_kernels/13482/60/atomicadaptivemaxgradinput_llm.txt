```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses in threads.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Pre-fetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by adjusting block and grid sizes.
// Evaluate the necessity of atomic operations and explore lock-free algorithms if possible.
