```cpp
// Use shared memory to buffer input data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider pre-loading weights and biases into registers to minimize repeated global memory accesses
// Explore using warp-level primitives like __shfl_xor to optimize reduction operations
// Adjust block size and grid size for better occupancy and resource utilization
