```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by assigning consecutive threads to consecutive memory addresses.
// Use asynchronous copy operations to overlap computation and memory transfers.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring aligned access within shared memory banks.
// Leverage warp-level primitives to reduce unnecessary serialization in memory access.
