```
// Consider using shared memory for neighboring elements to reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize coalesced accesses to optimize memory read patterns
// Implement loop unrolling if kernel is called multiple times in sequence
// Align data structures to improve memory alignment and reduce memory transactions
// Evaluate potential benefits of memory prefetching to hide latency
// Ensure grid and block size configurations maximize hardware occupancy
