```
// Consider using shared memory to store data that is reused across threads
// Minimize global memory access by using register variables
// Align data types to reduce memory access overhead
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Avoid divergent threads to maintain efficiency
// Leverage warp-level programming for improved performance
