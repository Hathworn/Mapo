```c
// Consider unrolling the reduction loop to improve performance.
// Utilize memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a stride pattern.
// Prefer using register variables for frequently accessed data.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding shared memory arrays.
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads() to minimize unnecessary synchronization.
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for better reduction performance.
