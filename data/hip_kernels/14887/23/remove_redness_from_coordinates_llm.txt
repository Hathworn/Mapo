// Consider using shared memory for d_r, d_g, and d_b to reduce global memory accesses.
// Precompute repetitive calculations to reduce redundant operations. For example, calculating base_y_index once per y loop.
// Avoid branching by using ternary operators for value assignments where possible.
// Optimize for memory coalescing by ensuring thread access patterns are aligned.
