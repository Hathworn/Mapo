// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like d_cdf_norm for faster access
// Pre-fetch data into registers to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize the calculation of image_index_1d to minimize arithmetic operations
// Utilize vectorized access patterns to improve memory coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive operations within the kernel
