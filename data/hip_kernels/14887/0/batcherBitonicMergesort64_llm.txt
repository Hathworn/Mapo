```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize shared memory reads and writes.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce the synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for stages and substages to improve performance.
// Investigate faster shared memory indexing to minimize potential bank conflicts.
// Assess the use of float2 or float4 data types for reducing memory transactions.
