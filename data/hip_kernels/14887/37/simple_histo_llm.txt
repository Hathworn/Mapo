```
// Consider using memory access patterns that maximize coalesced access
// Use shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory traffic
// Synchronize threads before accessing shared_bins to ensure no data races
// Minimize atomic operations in global memory by accumulating in shared memory first
// Ensure that shared memory is allocated correctly based on the number of bins
