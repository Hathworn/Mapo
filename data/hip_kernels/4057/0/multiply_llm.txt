```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for optimal performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure boundary conditions are correctly handled to avoid invalid memory access
// Utilize __syncthreads() appropriately to prevent data hazards
// Maximize block occupancy by choosing an appropriate BLOCK_SIZE
// Consider overlapping computation with memory loading where possible
// Optimize the use of shared memory to minimize bank conflicts
