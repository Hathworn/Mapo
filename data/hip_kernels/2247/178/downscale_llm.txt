```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for gradOutput_data
// Minimize register usage by reducing variable lifetimes
// Apply loop unrolling to optimize memory access and reduce iterations
// Consider using shared memory for reusing data among threads
// Use __forceinline__ directive where applicable for inline performance improvements
