```
// Utilize shared memory to decrease global memory access latency
// Optimize coalesced memory access patterns for better throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for increased instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure memory access is aligned to prevent bank conflicts
// Implement warp-level primitives for intra-warp communication optimization
