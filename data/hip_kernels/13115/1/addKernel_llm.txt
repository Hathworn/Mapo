// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and using contiguous memory allocations.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data or computational kernels to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure maximum bandwidth utilization by minimizing memory transaction count.
