```
// Precompute modulo offset before loop to reduce repeated calculations
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using aligned data structures
// Utilize shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and throughput
// Minimize divergent branches within thread warps
// Consider memory alignment and padding to prevent bank conflicts
