// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load kernel values into shared memory before computation starts
// Ensure all threads have synchronized access to shared memory
// Reduce redundant global memory accesses by using shared memory for kernel weights
// Improve coalesced access to global memory for source image data
