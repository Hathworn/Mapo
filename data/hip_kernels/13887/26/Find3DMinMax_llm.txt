```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Align the data access patterns to optimize memory coalescing
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by structuring the layout
// Minimize conditional checks within loops for better warp execution efficiency
// Reduce redundant float operations by consolidating calculations
// Maintain data locality to maximize shared memory utility
