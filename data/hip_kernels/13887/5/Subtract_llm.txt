```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for optimal performance
// Consider using shared memory if there are multiple accesses to the same data
// Ensure data is aligned to improve memory throughput
// Check if memory accesses are causing bank conflicts
// Profile and adjust block size to maximize occupancy
// Minimize memory footprint where possible
// Investigate vectorized loads/stores to increase data throughput
