// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant reads from global memory.
// Synchronize threads after shared memory operations to ensure data consistency.
// Write to global memory after verifying all conditions to reduce unnecessary writes.
