// Load frequently accessed global memory data into shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded into shared memory before usage.
// Use shared memory for computation to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Optimize arithmetic operations to reduce redundant computations.
// Use __fdividef to leverage faster division where applicable.
