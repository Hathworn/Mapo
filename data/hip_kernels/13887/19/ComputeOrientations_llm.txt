```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for loading g_Data to shared memory
// Pre-compute constant values outside of loops where possible
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned for optimal performance
// Reduce branching within critical loops to avoid warp divergence
// Leverage loop unrolling for small, fixed-size loops if beneficial
// Synchronize threads efficiently to minimize stalls
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts
