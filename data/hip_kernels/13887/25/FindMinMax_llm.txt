```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for d_Data to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Use more shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable.
// Use a thread stride loop for parallel reduction to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider more loop unrolling if shared memory allows to reduce loop control overhead.
