// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring data structures fit within shared memory limits.
// Consider improving memory coalescing by reorganizing data access patterns.
// Ensure proper alignment for memory access to minimize uncoalesced access.
// Minimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts and improve access efficiency.
// Preload frequently accessed data into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure optimal usage of shared memory by adjusting block and grid sizes accordingly.
// Efficient use of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Consider loop unrolling or other compiler optimizations for frequently used calculations.
// Optimize access patterns to ensure alignment with cache and memory transaction sizes.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed constants to improve access speed.
