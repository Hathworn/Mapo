```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data array accesses for better performance.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize the Gaussian computation by precomputing constant values outside main loops.
// Unroll inner loops where possible to increase instruction throughput.
// Maintain synchronized threads at key points to ensure all shared memory operations are complete.
// Minimize conditional statements within threads to maximize parallel efficiency.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for the histogram reduction phase to optimize performance.
