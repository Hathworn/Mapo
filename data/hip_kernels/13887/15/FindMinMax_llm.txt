```
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to optimize memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure each thread accesses contiguous memory to improve coalescing.
// Unroll loops to minimize branching and improve instruction throughput.
// Employ efficient in-block reduction to minimize synchronization costs.
// Balance the number of registers used to avoid spilling to local memory.
