// Consider coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal memory access speed
// Use shared memory if data reuse within a block is possible
// Minimize divergent branches for better efficiency
// Possibly enlarge thread block size for better occupancy
// Consider using vectorized data types for load/store efficiency
