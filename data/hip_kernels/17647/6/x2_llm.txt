```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if data reuse is possible.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory efficiency.
// Optimize the number of threads per block to achieve maximum hardware throughput.
// Ensure each thread in a warp accesses consecutive memory addresses to avoid bank conflicts.
