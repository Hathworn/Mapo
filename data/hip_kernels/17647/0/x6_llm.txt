// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Use shared memory if applicable for frequently accessed data.
// Avoid unnecessary reads and writes to global memory.
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing variable usage inside loops.
// Consider loop unrolling for performance enhancement.
// Ensure all memory allocations are properly aligned for better access speed.
