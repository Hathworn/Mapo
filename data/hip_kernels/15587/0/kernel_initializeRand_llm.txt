```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize block and grid sizes to ensure maximum occupancy.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for coalesced access.
// Use constant memory for data that does not change to improve latency.
// Employ loop unrolling when initializing to further enhance performance.
