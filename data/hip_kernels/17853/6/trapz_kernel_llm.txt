```
// Consider adjusting the shared memory size to better utilize blockDim.x
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory reads
// Use shared memory to minimize atomic operations on global memory
// Reduce the number of iterations using a more efficient grid-stride loop
// Optimize the reduction step by using parallel reduction techniques within a block
// Ensure all threads in the block contribute effectively to the shared memory reduction
