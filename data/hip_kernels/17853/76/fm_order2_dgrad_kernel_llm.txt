```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for storing intermediate results like emb_sum to reduce global memory access.
// Use vectorized loads and stores to improve memory bandwidth utilization when accessing in, top_grad, and dgrad arrays.
// Implement loop unrolling in the for loops to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
