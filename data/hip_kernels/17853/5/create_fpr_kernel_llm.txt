// Precompute constants outside of loop to reduce redundant computation
// Use stride-based loop for better parallelism and cache efficiency
// Consider using shared memory for variables accessed frequently by threads
// Optimize for coalesced memory access in global memory operations
// Reduce memory bank conflicts in shared memory access if applied
// Minimize use of divergent branches within warp threads
