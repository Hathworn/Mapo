// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for the pointers to help the compiler with optimization
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by checking alignment and data structure layout
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring uniform execution across threads in a warp
// Consider loop unrolling for the slot_num loop for increased performance
// Utilize shared memory for storing intermediate values like emb_sum if possible
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy and performance
// Profile and analyze the kernel to identify any bottlenecks in memory access or computation
