// Use shared memory to avoid frequent global memory accesses.
// Align shared memory accesses to improve memory coalescing.
// Consider double buffering technique to overlap computation and memory transfers.
// Ensure warp is utilized fully to avoid divergence in reduction step.
// Prefetch data into registers if possible to reduce memory latency.
