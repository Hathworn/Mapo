```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() calls for better performance.
// Explore vectorized memory loads for further memory access optimization.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to hide global memory latency.
// Examine loop unrolling for the reduction step to enhance parallel execution.
// Ensure each thread maintains a consistent access pattern to avoid bank conflicts.
// Investigate warp-level primitives for optimized data reduction.
