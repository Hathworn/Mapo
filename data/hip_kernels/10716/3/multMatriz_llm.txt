```
// Consider using shared memory for tiles of da and db to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement loop unrolling in the dot product calculation for better performance
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce the number of synchronization points
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for GPU architecture
// Allocate memory with appropriate alignment to enhance coalesced access
