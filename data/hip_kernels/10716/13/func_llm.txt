```
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory transactions
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper data alignment
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive computation within the kernel
// Use fewer registers per thread if possible to allow for more active warps per multiprocessor
// Evaluate the necessity of __syncthreads() to determine if it can be reduced or eliminated
// Explore occupancy-to-core ratio to maximize thread utilization
// Consider using local memory if shared memory size exceeds available resources
