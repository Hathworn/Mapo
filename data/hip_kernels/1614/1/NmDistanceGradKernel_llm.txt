```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Utilize vectorized loads and stores for xyz1, xyz2 to improve coalesced access.
// Optimize atomic operations by minimizing usage or restructuring the algorithm.
// Examine potential bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Evaluate usage of loop unrolling for computational efficiency.
