```
// Use shared memory buffer to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Minimize divergence by aligning loop exit condition across threads
// Unroll loops to enhance memory access pattern and decrease overhead
// Utilize '__syncthreads()' to ensure data consistency when using shared memory
// Initialize 'best' variable with FLT_MAX to optimize comparison checks
