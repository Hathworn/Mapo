```
// Use shared memory to cache xyz2 for coalesced memory access
// Consider tuning the batch size to optimize shared memory use
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded before computation
// Unroll the inner loop to increase instruction level parallelism
// Use float intrinsics for potentially faster computation
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses if possible
// Profile to identify memory access patterns and optimize further
