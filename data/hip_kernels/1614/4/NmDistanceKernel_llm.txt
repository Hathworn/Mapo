```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for xyz and xyz2 arrays to improve performance.
// Load xyz2 data in shared memory efficiently, currently done using buf array.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help compiler optimize memory accesses.
// Ensure shared memory usage is at its minimum to allow more blocks to be resident â€¢
// Minimize usage of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
