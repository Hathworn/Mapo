```
// Use shared memory to cache xyz1 and xyz2 to improve memory access speed
// Reduce atomic operations by accumulating results in registers before atomicAdd
// Consider loop unrolling if n is a compile-time constant to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access for all device memory reads and writes
// Optimize index calculations to minimize arithmetic operations in each iteration
