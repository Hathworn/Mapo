```
// Consider reducing memory access for the `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `k4`, and `rho` arrays by using shared memory if possible
// Optimize the usage of the `tmp` array to minimize unnecessary reads and writes
// Investigate potential loop unrolling in the main simulation loop for better performance
// Analyze memory coalescing for global memory reads and writes to improve memory access patterns
// Evaluate the possibility of applying constant memory for parameters that do not change per thread
// Profile computation versus memory access to identify potential bottlenecks
// Consider using managed memory or unified memory access patterns for `delays`, `alphas`, `betas`, and other constant inputs
// Check for warp divergence within the calculation loops and consider restructuring code for uniform branch execution
// Optimize the use of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions by evaluating if precomputation is viable
