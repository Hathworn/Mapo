// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread block size and data stride
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like Delaylist
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize latency and maximize throughput
// Analyze and reduce bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for one-dimensional data like Delaylist
// Use constant memory for invariant values such as w, FWHM, G1, G2, G3, and t_min
