```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns.
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Align data structures to 32 bytes for better memory access efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditional statements.
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to enhance computational throughput.
