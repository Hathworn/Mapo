```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive elements in global memory.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by organizing data accesses properly.
// Use a warp-synchronous reduction to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Implement loop unrolling in the reduction step to enhance performance.
// Consider increasing block size for better utilization if shared memory allows.
