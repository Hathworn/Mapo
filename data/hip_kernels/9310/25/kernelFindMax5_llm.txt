```c
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and latency
// Use atomic operations sparingly to avoid contention and ensure correctness
// Perform data loading and computation in the same step to maximize resource utilization
// Balance workload across threads to ensure efficient use of computational resources
// Consider occupancy and adjust block size for better performance
