// Use shared memory efficiently by prefetching adjacent values in coalesced patterns  
// Reduce divergent branching by limiting conditions within threads  
// Apply unrolling techniques to minimize loop overhead and increase warp efficiency  
// Ensure precise memory synchronization using __syncthreads()  
// Use volatile keyword judiciously to prevent compiler optimizations that could result in incorrect behavior  
// Choose appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and balance workloads
