// Use shared memory to reduce atomic operations on global memory
// Optimize memory access patterns to enhance coalescing
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Ensure threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Reduce the number of atomic operations for better performance
// Balance the workload among threads and blocks
