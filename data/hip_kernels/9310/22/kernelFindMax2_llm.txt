// Optimize shared memory allocation size to reduce memory usage
// Load elements into cache with bounds checking to avoid out-of-bound memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have written to shared memory before proceeding
// Implement warp-synchronous reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Utilize atomic operations for updating the global maximum to ensure thread safety
