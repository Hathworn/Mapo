// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency   
// Reduce bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory access is coalesced  
// Minimize divergent branching by consistent thread execution paths  
// Leverage thread synchronization with __syncthreads() to ensure data integrity  
// Use atomic operations cautiously to avoid overhead in accumulation operations
