// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory for data exchanges to minimize global memory access.
// Minimize warp divergence during reduction for better performance.
// Ensure memory operations are properly aligned to prevent excessive bank conflicts.
// Evaluate the possibility of using persistent threads to further reduce synchronization overhead.
