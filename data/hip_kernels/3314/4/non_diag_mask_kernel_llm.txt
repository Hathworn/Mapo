```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to provide compiler with assumptions about pointer aliasing.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for row_data and col_data if they are reused.
// Ensure thread divergence is minimized in the control flow for efficiency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to out_data by ensuring optimal access patterns.
// Add loop unrolling for any potential iterative operations within the kernel for better performance.
