// Ensure memory coalescing for shared memory accesses
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Optimize shared memory allocation to minimize usage
// Utilize cooperative groups for efficient synchronization
// Explore reducing redundant synchronizations
// Consider potential bank conflicts in shared memory operations
// Evaluate thread block size to optimize performance
// Review warp usage for maximizing parallel execution
