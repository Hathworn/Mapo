// Consider coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures to warp boundaries.
// Use shared memory to cache in_lod and num_erased elements within the block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Eliminate divergent branches by using masked assignments when possible.
// Prefetch relevant data to reduce memory latency and improve throughput.
