// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data accesses with warp threads
// Explore use of shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Analyze the possibility of using texture memory for read-only data to improve bandwidth
// Evaluate thread block size and shape to maximize occupancy
