```
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure memory alignment for better performance
// Minimize the use of global memory where possible
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce branch overhead
