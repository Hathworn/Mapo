```
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory bandwidth.
// Minimize use of atomicAdd by restructuring data writes, possibly accumulating partial results in shared memory.
// Check if using float4 or float2 types would lead to better memory throughput.
// Evaluate grid and block dimensions to ensure optimal occupancy.
// Analyze shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
