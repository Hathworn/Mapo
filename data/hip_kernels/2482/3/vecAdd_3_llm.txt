```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access times.
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for a, b, and c arrays to utilize memory bandwidth efficiently.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling to improve throughput by executing multiple operations per loop iteration.
// Monitor register usage to prevent register spilling, which can degrade performance.
// Test different block and grid configurations to maximize occupancy and performance.
