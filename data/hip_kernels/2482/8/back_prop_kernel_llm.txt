```
// Consider increasing the use of shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads.
// Reduce the use of atomic operations as they can be costly and serialize parallel execution.
// Use loop unrolling techniques where possible to speed up repeated calculations inside the loop.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to prevent potential performance penalties.
