```
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses for a, b, and c to improve bandwidth usage
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to warp size boundaries
// Utilize memory prefetching to hide latency
// Consider loop unrolling for potential increased performance
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size/grid size for optimal resource utilization
