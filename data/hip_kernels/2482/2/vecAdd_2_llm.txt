```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for 'a', 'b', and 'c' arrays.
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for improved performance.
// Ensure alignment of data for better memory throughput.
// Investigate the use of memory prefetching techniques to reduce latency.
// Assess the impact of register pressure and adjust block size if necessary.
