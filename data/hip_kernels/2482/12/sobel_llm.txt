// Consider coalesced memory accesses in global memory to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory efficiently and ensure threads access adjacent memory locations.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronizations to improve computational efficiency.
// Optimize shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring even distribution of access across tiles.
