// Combine boundary checking with variable calculations to avoid redundant computations.
// Precompute often-used index or factor terms outside of conditional statements to reduce duplicate calculations.
// Use efficient memory access patterns to improve cache performance.
// Consider the alignment and memory coalescing for better memory access efficiency.
