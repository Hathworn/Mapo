// Use shared memory to reduce redundant reads and improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Avoid uncoalesced global memory access by rearranging data or thread indices if possible.
// Minimize divergent branches to ensure higher thread utilization.
