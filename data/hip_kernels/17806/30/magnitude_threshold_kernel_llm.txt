```cpp
// Optimize global memory access by coalescing reads.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts for improved performance.
// Consider using vectorized loads for grad arrays for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage to reduce overhead where possible.
// Use float3 for grad elements to exploit vectorization potential.
// Ensure proper grid and block sizes are configured for occupancy maximization.
