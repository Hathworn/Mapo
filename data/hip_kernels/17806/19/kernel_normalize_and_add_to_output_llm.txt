```
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern by reorganizing memory layout if possible
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate values for better access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches by possibly restructuring conditional statements
// Ensure maximum occupancy by configuring the block size according to the GPU architecture
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed constants like c_volSize and c_normalize
