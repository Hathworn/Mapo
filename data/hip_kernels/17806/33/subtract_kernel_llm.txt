```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to cache inputs if there's reuse within the block to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to increase memory transaction efficiency.
// Try to minimize divergent branches; the boundary check can be optimized.
