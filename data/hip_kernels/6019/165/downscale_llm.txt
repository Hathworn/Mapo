```
// Launch the kernel with optimal block size for the given problem size.
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring continuous threads access nearby memory locations.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if overlapping access is detected for increased bandwidth efficiency.
// Reduce global memory accesses by computing repetitive index calculations beforehand if possible.
// Check if using texture memory can reduce load efficiency for read-only gradOutput_data accesses.
// Consider using vectorized types like float2 or float4 for coalesced memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring access patterns do not favor specific banks.
