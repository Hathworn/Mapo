```
// Consider using float4 for memory access to utilize vectorized loads
// Ensure a and b are aligned to 16 bytes to benefit from coalesced access with float4
// Consider using a loop with a step of 4 in combination with float4 to increase bandwidth utilization
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used correctly to prevent race conditions
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to accelerate the final reduction steps
// Avoid using volatile if possible by relying on warp shuffle for reduction
