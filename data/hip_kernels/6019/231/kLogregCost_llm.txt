```cpp
// Use shared memory for maxProbs, labelLogProbs, and correctProbs to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using __shfl_sync for efficiency in reduction operations within a warp.
// Use vectorized memory access patterns where possible to improve memory throughput.
// Check if __syncthreads_or can be replaced with warp-level primitives for performance gain.
// Align data structures to reduce memory access latency and improve coalescing.
// Minimize branching conditions within the warp for better performance.
