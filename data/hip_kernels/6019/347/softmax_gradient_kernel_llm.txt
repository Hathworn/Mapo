// Unroll loops to improve memory access patterns for dY and Y.
// Consider using shared memory to cache data reused by threads for better memory access efficiency.
// Optimize reduction via parallel tree-reduction to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency.
