```c
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning RND_THREADS_PER_BLOCK with warp size
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need access to the same data
// Minimize global memory access by reducing the number of reads and writes
// Use __restrict__ qualifier if no aliasing occurs to help the compiler optimize
// Align the d states to 128 bytes to improve global memory access efficiency
