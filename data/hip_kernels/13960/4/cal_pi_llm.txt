```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Investigate coalesced memory access patterns.
// Reduce the frequency of global memory writes.
// Minimize divergence in control flow.
// Unroll loops to decrease loop overhead.
// Ensure that the index computation minimizes arithmetic operations.
// Check for potential bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Use appropriate memory space specifiers to optimize usage.
