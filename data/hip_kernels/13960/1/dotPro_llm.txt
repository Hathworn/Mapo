```c
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Employ efficient strided loop to reduce iteration overhead on memory accesses
// Implement loop unrolling in reduction to minimize synchronization requirement
// Ensure that only the first thread writes to global memory to minimize atomic operations
```
