// Consider using shared memory to store normalization_factor for better memory access speed.
// Unroll loops if the data size is known and small to improve throughput.
// Check if coalesced memory access patterns can be further optimized.
// Minimize the number of times invScale is computed outside of the conditional statement.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if no aliasing occurs to improve compiler optimizations.
