```
// Consider coalesced memory access for u and v arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate aligning src, dst, and normalization_factor accesses to reduce memory transaction size
// Investigate the impact of shared memory usage to cache frequently accessed data such as flow_row_offset
// Analyze the trade-offs of using __ldg() for read-only data to leverage L1 cache if appropriate
// Ensure branch divergence is minimized by restructuring conditional accumulation logic
// Consider loop unrolling or further simplification in accumulate lambda to enhance compiler optimizations
