```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for u, v, and src arrays.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block.
// Ensure that loads and stores are aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider using texture memory for potentially coalesced global memory reads.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit this kernel for the image and flow stride calculations.
