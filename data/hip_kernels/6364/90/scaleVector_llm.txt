```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Avoid divergent branching to maintain warp efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory if there are multiple memory accesses to the same data.
// Ensure memory alignment to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Use occupancy calculator tools to ensure optimal block and grid dimensions.
