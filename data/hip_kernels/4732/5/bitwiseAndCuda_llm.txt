```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Ensure coalesced access by organizing data in a suitable layout
// Prefetch data to registers where applicable to hide memory latency
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize occupancy and performance
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same control path
