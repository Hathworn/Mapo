// Use shared memory to store the lookup table to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to enable coalesced reads from global memory.
// Ensure that the memory accesses align with warp boundaries for better efficiency.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to improve throughput in the kernel.
