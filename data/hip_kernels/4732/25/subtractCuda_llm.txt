// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to store row data if possible
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for better performance
// Reduce the number of instructions in shared memory computation
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to minimize instruction overhead
// Prefetch data into registers when the pattern of access is predictable
