```
// Consider using texture memory for read-only input arrays to exploit caching
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements
// Minimize divergent branching within warps by structuring conditions to reflect probable outcomes
// Employ shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, particularly in compute-intensive operations
// Fuse multiple kernel launches where possible to minimize memory latency and kernel invocation overhead
