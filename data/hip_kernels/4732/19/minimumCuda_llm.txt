```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring memory is accessed sequentially.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth and increase reuse.
// Optimize thread block size to ensure maximum memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency.
// Leverage asynchronous memory prefetching for higher throughput.
