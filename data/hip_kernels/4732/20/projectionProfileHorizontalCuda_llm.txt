```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize atomic operations as they can be a bottleneck for performance.
// Ensure threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations to fully utilize memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if applicable.
