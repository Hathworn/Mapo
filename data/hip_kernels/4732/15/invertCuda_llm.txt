// Consider using shared memory to cache input row data for coalesced access
// Optimize block size and grid size based on GPU architecture for optimal occupancy
// Align rowSizeIn and rowSizeOut to improve coalesced global memory access
// Consider employing texture memory for 2D spatial locality and improved cache performance
