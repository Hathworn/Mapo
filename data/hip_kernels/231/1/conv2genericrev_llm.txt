```c
// Use coalesced memory access to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Store frequently accessed data in shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring consistent control flow across warps.
// Optimize memory accesses by aligning data with cache line boundaries, if possible.
// Ensure enough threads are used to keep the GPU fully occupied.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and ensure data consistency.
