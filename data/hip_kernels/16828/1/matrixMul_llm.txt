// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for matrices 'a' and 'b'
// Prefetch data to registers for frequently accessed elements within the loop
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and execution efficiency
