```
// Use shared memory for input matrices to reduce global memory access
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce latency
// Consider using pinned memory for faster data transfers
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy
// Minimize register usage by optimizing variable declarations
