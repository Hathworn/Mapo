```
// Use fmaxf function to ensure optimal performance with single-precision computations.
// Improved memory access pattern in the loop to enhance coalesced access.
// Utilize atomicAdd to prevent race conditions when updating quadratic and linear arrays.
// Consider utilizing shared memory if quadratic and linear arrays have frequent access.
// Ensure adequate occupancy by tuning block size and grid size.
