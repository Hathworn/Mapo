```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Synchronize threads to ensure all have finished writing to shared memory
// Consider memory access pattern for reading shared memory to optimize cache usage
// Optimize thread divergence by handling special cases outside the main loop when possible
