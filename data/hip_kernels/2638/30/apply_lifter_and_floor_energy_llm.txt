```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for lifter coefficients.
// Ensure efficient memory coalescing by aligning the shared memory usage with the thread index.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory.
// Use shared memory size optimization to balance between performance and resource usage.
// Consider adjusting blockDim.x for optimal parallelization based on the hardware architecture.
// Use logf instead of log for better performance with float precision.
