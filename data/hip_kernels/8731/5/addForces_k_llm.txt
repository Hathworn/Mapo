```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately.
// Avoid shared memory bank conflicts by using proper memory alignment.
// Use float2 to optimize memory usage and improve data alignment.
// Pre-compute repeated expressions to minimize the number of arithmetic operations.
// Use fused multiply-add (FMA) operations if available for efficiency.
// Ensure the pitch alignment is correctly handled to prevent memory access issues.
// Minimize register usage by merging arithmetic operations where possible.
