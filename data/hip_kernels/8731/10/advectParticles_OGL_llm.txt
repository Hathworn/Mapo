```
// Consider using shared memory for caching frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns for part and v arrays to improve memory throughput
// Implement memory access alignment to ensure efficient usage of memory bandwidth
// Optimize thread block size and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and parallelism
// Evaluate use of texture memory for potentially faster memory access compared to global memory
// Reduce branching by restructuring the code to minimize divergent paths within warp execution
