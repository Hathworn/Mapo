```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid redundant accesses to global memory by using cached values
// Ensure correct synchronization with __syncthreads() before reading shared memory
// Consider allocating more threads to better utilize available bandwidth
// Optimize thread usage by minimizing idle threads
```
