```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for u and v for better performance
// Implement caching for frequently accessed variables like flow_row_offset and image_row_offset
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Prefer using __ldg() for read-only global memory access to leverage texture cache
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized or optimized using warp-level primitives if possible
// Precompute constant expressions outside of loops to save computational overhead
// Optimize boundary condition checks to reduce branching and improve warp execution efficiency
