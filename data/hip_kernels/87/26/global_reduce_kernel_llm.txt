```
// Consider coalescing global memory reads for d_in to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts during shared memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for the reduction loop to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Ensure __syncthreads() usage is correct to avoid unnecessary synchronization and divergence.
// Evaluate thread index arithmetic to ensure it promotes efficient memory access patterns.
