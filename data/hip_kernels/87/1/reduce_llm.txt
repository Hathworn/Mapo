```
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve access pattern
// Use atomic operations cautiously to avoid serialization
// Prefetch data into registers for frequently accessed variables
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Ensure data alignment for efficient memory accesses
