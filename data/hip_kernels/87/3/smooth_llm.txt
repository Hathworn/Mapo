// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for neighboring elements.
// Consider loop unrolling if the smoothing operation involves repetitive calculations.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Adjust block size for maximizing occupancy and minimizing idle threads.
