```
// Use shared memory to store data for faster access and reduced global memory traffic.
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory operations are completed before proceeding.
// Minimize conditional branches within performance-critical code sections.
// Optimize memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Ensure memory coalescing for global memory reads and writes.
