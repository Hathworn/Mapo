```cpp
// Use __restrict__ keyword to help the compiler with additional optimization opportunities.
// Consider aligning d_in and d_out to warp boundaries to improve memory coalescing.
// Ensure sdata is accessed in a coalesced pattern to maximize memory performance.
// Explore potential benefits of loop unrolling in the reduction loop for better performance.
// Evaluate the impact of occupancy for this kernel and adjust block size accordingly.
