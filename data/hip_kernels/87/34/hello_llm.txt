```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve performance
// Use __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions if threads are modifying shared data
// Optimize usage of registers by minimizing variable lifetimes
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by organizing threads efficiently
