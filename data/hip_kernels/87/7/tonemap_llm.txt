```cpp
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed variables for faster access
// Coalesce global memory access when reading inputs like d_x, d_y, and d_log_Y
// Group consecutive threads to access contiguous memory locations to improve memory coalescing
// Minimize the usage of global memory by reusing variables and using shared/local memory
// Ensure data alignment in global memory to leverage memory coalescing efficiently
