```
// Consider coalescing accesses to d_in to optimize global memory load efficiency
// Ensure alignment of the data in d_bins and d_in to reduce memory transactions
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses for d_bins
// Employ loop unrolling techniques if BIN_COUNT is small and loop iterations are predictable
// Evaluate the usage of larger thread blocks to improve occupancy
