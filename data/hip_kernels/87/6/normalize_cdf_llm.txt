```
// Precompute normalization constant outside of the thread loop to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use a single read operation for d_input_cdf[n-1] to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory if further memory access optimization is needed.
