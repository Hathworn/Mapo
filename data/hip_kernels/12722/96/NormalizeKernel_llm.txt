// Consider using shared memory to cache normalization_factor for better memory access coalescing.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to optimize global memory throughput.
// Investigate using __ldg for loading normalization_factor to potentially increase cache hit rate.
// Evaluate using float2 for image data to benefit from vectorized memory operations.
// Profile the use of different block sizes for better warp scheduling and occupancy.
// Exploit register usage to minimize global memory traffic.
