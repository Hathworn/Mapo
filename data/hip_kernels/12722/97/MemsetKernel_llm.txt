```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block
// Use loop unrolling where applicable to reduce loop overhead in pixel processing
// Optimize arithmetic operations by minimizing redundant calculations
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from caching capabilities
