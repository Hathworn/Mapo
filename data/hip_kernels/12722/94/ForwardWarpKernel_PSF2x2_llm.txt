// Consider coalescing memory access for u, v, and src arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Assess the potential of using shared memory to temporarily store values for normalization_factor and dst to reduce global memory traffic.
// Evaluate if using __ldg intrinsic for read-only data could enhance memory read performance.
// Explore whether loop unrolling could reduce overhead in boundary checking conditions.
