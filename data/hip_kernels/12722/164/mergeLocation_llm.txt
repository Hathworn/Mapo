// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency  
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for better performance  
// Favor shared memory reads over global memory reads for frequently accessed data  
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal shared memory utilization  
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads when accessing shared memory  
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce contention
