```
// Consider coalescing memory access for arrays A, B, C to improve throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access within the binary search loop.
// Optimize the calculation of indices A_start and B_start for better memory access patterns.
// Avoid divergent branching by restructuring binary search logic.
// Ensure all threads complete initialization to avoid potential synchronization issues.
// Use __ldg() built-in function for constant memory access patterns for arrays A, B, C if beneficial.
// Explore loop unrolling in the merging segment for reduced loop overhead.
