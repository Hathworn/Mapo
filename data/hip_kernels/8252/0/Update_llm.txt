```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory access patterns.
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel for better performance.
// Use __restrict__ keyword to minimize pointer aliasing effects.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Check for bank conflicts when using shared memory to optimize performance.
// Make sure to launch enough threads to fully utilize the GPU's SMs.
// Use a loop unrolling technique if applicable to reduce instruction overhead.
