```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads' access to surface memory
// Minimize divergent branches by using warp-centric checks instead of individual thread checks
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse across threads can be identified
// Ensure trigonometric computations are minimized and reused across similar calculations
// Evaluate impacts of loop unrolling if iterative calculations exist within the kernel
