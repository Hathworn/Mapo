```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Explore the use of vectorized data types (e.g., float4) for better memory efficiency
// Ensure proper grid and block size configuration for maximum GPU occupancy
