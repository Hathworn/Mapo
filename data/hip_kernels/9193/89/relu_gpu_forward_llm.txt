```
// Utilize coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory positions
// Consider employing shared memory to cache input data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure enough threads per block to hide latency and maximize occupancy
// Use vectorized operations if aligned memory accesses are guaranteed for further optimization
