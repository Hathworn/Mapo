```
// Utilize shared memory to cache polynomial coefficients for reuse within the block
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() after loading shared memory data
// Consider using constant memory for frequently accessed coefficients and settings
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing conditional checks effectively
// Align shared memory usage with warp size to avoid bank conflicts
// Load LUT data into shared memory in a coalesced manner for efficient access
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
