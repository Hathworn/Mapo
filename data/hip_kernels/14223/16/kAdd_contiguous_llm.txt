// Consider using coalesced memory access when reading from global memory to maximize memory bandwidth
// Reduce __syncthreads() calls where possible to minimize overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts
// Implement vectorized operations or loop unrolling to enhance performance
