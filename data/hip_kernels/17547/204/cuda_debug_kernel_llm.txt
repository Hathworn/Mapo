```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved global memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
// Employ memory prefetching techniques to hide memory latency
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and resource usage
