```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threadIdx.x with the data layout.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring warp execution paths remain coherent.
// Consider memory alignment to reduce bank conflicts.
// Prefetch memory outside of critical loops to improve cache utilization.
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized or replaced wherever possible to reduce contention.
