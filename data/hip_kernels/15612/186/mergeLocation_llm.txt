```c
// Load loc_ into register to reduce global memory access
// Use registers for loc.x and loc.y for efficient computation
// Use shared memory if repeated access to nearby elements is needed
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for loc_ array
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy
```
