```
// Consider using memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize the memory access pattern to reduce the number of transactions.
// Use the conditional operator to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
// Implement warp unrolling to reduce the number of synchronization points.
// Optimize warp-level operations to minimize latency.
// Ensure that shared memory is efficiently utilized for data reduction.
// Combine warp unrolling with shared memory to maximize efficiency.
