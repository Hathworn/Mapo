```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring continuous memory blocks are accessed by consecutive threads.
// Ensure `b` is accessed efficiently; it might be beneficial to load once per block and use shared memory.
// Minimize global memory accesses by considering using registers or shared memory for intermediary computations.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Ensure kernel configuration maximizes occupancy and utilizes available resources optimally.
