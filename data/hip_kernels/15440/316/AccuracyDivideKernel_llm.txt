```cpp
// Consider using shared memory if N is large to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for optimal performance.
// Check if atomic operations are needed for larger grid sizes to avoid race conditions.
// Leverage threadfence or __syncthreads if different threads might read/write the same location.
