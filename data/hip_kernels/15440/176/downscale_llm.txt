```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when accumulating 'sum'.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to 'gradOutput_data' to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using half precision if lower precision is acceptable for performance gains.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring 'ii < no_elements' check is streamlined.
// Utilize warp shuffle operations if applicable, to reduce memory latency.
// Ensure alignment of global memory accesses to reduce potential memory throttling.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to ensure maximum SM occupancy and warp efficiency.
