```
// Consider increasing block size to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Use float4 for coalesced memory access in unrolled loop
// Evaluate if shared memory usage impacts occupancy and consider optimization
// Use __restrict__ keyword to indicate non-aliasing pointers for potential compiler optimizations
// Investigate if using more registers per thread improves performance through hipOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize
// Ensure memory access pattern is coalesced for best performance
// Review usage of __syncthreads() to ensure it is necessary and minimize its use
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction instead of full __syncthreads where possible
