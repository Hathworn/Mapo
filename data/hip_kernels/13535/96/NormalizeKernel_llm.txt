```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with data rows
// Consider loop unrolling for operations within the kernel for better performance
// Use warp-level primitives for intra-warp communication, reducing shared memory use
