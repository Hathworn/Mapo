```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access speed by reducing global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous block data is accessed by contiguous threads
// Use register tiling to minimize memory latency by working on smaller blocks of data at a time
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction level parallelism
// Ensure 128-bit memory transactions alignment to reduce transaction overhead
// Minimize thread block divergence by ensuring consistent flow of execution paths
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of caching mechanisms
