```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for matrices A and B
// Ensure all threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations
// Increase the tile size if shared memory allows for it
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts
// Utilize vectorized memory accesses where possible
// Explore using float4 loads to reduce memory transactions
// Double-buffer shared memory to overlap computation and data transfer
// Investigate use of warp-level primitives to balance usage and reduce delay
