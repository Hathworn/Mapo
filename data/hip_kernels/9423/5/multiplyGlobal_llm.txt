```
// Use shared memory to minimize access to global memory
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for left and right arrays
// Maximize utilization of shared memory by adjusting block size
// Align shared memory access patterns with warp size to reduce bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling within the inner loop for performance gain
