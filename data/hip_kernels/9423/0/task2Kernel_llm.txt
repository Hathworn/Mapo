```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Analyze the kernel for potential shared memory usage
// Evaluate if loop unrolling would provide performance benefits
// Inspect warp divergence possibilities and optimize if necessary
// Check for alignment of memory accesses for better performance
