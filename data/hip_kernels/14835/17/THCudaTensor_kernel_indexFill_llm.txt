```
// Consider using shared memory if stride values are reused frequently
// Ensure coalesced memory access by reordering operations if possible
// Investigate tiling techniques to improve cache utilization
// Minimize divergent branching to maintain warp efficiency
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed values such as tensor dimensions
// Explore using vectorized data types for potential throughput improvement
// Profile memory transactions to verify efficient global memory access
