```
// Consider using a memory coalescing pattern for accessing `row[i]`.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing its size if possible.
// Ensure `__syncthreads()` is used effectively to prevent race conditions.
// Evaluate if using `atomicAdd` for reduction might be beneficial in certain cases.
// Check if loop unrolling could increase performance for the inner loop.
// Assess potential benefits of using warp shuffle functions for reduction.
