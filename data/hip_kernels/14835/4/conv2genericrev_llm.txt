```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads.
// Optimize thread block dimensions to maximize the use of shared memory.
// Ensure alignment of data to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Minimize divergence by aligning warps with computation tasks.
// Use fewer registers per thread to allow for increased occupancy.
// Check if tile size can be adjusted to optimize shared memory usage.
