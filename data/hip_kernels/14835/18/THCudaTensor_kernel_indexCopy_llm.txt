```
// Use shared memory for index storage to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch res and src data to shared memory where possible to improve access efficiency
// Ensure memory coalescing by adjusting access patterns of src and res
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to enable better compiler optimization
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and resource utilization
