```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Load index into registers to minimize memory access latency.
// Leverage warp-level parallelism for better memory coalescing.
// Unroll loops to decrease branch divergence and increase throughput.
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory data consistency.
