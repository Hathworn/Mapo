```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory read efficiency.
// Use shared memory to store repeated values locally and reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to ensure maximum occupancy and warp efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branches within threads of the same warp to enhance performance.
// Analyze memory alignment and padding to avoid misaligned accesses.
