```
//Use shared memory to cache values that are reused by multiple threads within the same block.
//Consider using mixed precision to reduce memory bandwidth and improve performance.
//Align data to memory transaction boundaries to optimize memory access patterns.
//Try using vectorized memory operations to load/store multiple floats at once.
//Utilize coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
