// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed values for threads within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Precompute values that can be reused across different iterations to minimize redundant calculations.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns where possible to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate the possibility of using vectorized types for memory access to improve throughput, if applicable.
