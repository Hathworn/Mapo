```
// Consider using __shared__ memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Use memory coalescing techniques for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize the use of printf as it can degrade performance on the GPU
// Ensure that the kernel is launched with optimal block and grid sizes
// Align data structures to 16 or 32 bytes for better memory access patterns
