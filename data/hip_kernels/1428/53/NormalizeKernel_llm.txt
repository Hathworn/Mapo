```
// Consider using shared memory to cache normalization_factor to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access sequential memory locations sequentially.
// Preload frequently accessed memory data into registers to minimize repeated global memory reads.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized, especially in the conditional operator for inversion.
