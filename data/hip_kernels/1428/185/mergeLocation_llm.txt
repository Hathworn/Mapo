```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loops if applicable to improve instruction throughput
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data access with spatial locality
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory bandwidth efficiency
