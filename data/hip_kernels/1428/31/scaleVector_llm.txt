```
// Use shared memory to optimize data access and reduce global memory transactions
// Adjust shared memory size according to the block size to maximize usage
// Ensure synchronization across threads after loading to shared memory to prevent race conditions
// Load data once to shared memory to reduce repeated global memory reads
