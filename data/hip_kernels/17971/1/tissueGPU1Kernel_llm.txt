// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory is correctly sized for the block
// Minimize __syncthreads usage to reduce warp divergence
// Optimize the loading of shared memory to minimize memory transactions
// Ensure correct boundaries when accessing shared memory
// Consider coalescing memory access for d_qt000 and d_dtt000
// Tune block size for optimal occupancy and performance
