```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for d_vessxyz for further performance improvement
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_tissxyz and d_pt000
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory access patterns in shared memory
// Evaluate using texture memory if access patterns are suitable for often-used input data
// Optimize register usage by balancing between available registers and occupancy
