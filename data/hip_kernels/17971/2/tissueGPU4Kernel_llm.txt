```
// Consider using shared memory to decrease global memory access latency.
// Attempt to coalesce memory accesses when loading from d_tisspoints.
// Improve memory alignment for better performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Unroll loops where applicable for reduced overhead.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to allow compiler optimizations.
// Ensure float operations use FMA (fused multiply-add) if supported by hardware.
