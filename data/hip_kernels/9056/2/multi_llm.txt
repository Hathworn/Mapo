// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure TILE_WIDTH is properly defined to match kernel dimensions.
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance parallelism and reduce branching overhead.
// Unrolling the inner loop can improve memory access efficiency and instruction throughput.
// Synchronization points (__syncthreads) are crucial to ensure data consistency within shared memory.
