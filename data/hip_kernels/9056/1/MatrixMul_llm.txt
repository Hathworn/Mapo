```
// Consider using shared memory to cache tiles of Md and Nd to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations in global memory.
// Reduce warp divergence by aligning boundary checks with warp sizes.
// Explore the use of loop unrolling to reduce overhead and increase arithmetic intensity.
// Ensure block size is chosen to maximize occupancy and consider using launch bounds to optimize performance.
