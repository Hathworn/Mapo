```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables like u_ and v_ to reduce global memory access.
// Check if using constant memory would benefit the access pattern for read-only data like time_scale.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by optimizing the thread block size and shape based on device architecture.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized data types, such as float4, where appropriate for better throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches in the code to improve overall warp efficiency.
// Consider prefetching data to hide latency, especially for src and dst arrays.
