```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for normalization_factor
// Load normalization_factor[pos] into a register to reduce repeated access
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for image data if possible
// Optimize thread block size for occupancy and memory access patterns
// Employ warp-level primitives to minimize thread divergence
