```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory access coalescing by aligning data structures
// Use __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler with optimizations
// Prefetch data to shared memory if access pattern is predictable
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
