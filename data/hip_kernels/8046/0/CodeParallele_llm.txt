```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if multiple threads access neighboring data.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring continuous memory reads/writes among threads.
// Optimize the bounds check to reduce divergence within warps.
// Ensure that matDest is accessed in a coalesced manner for improved memory throughput.
// Utilize pre-loading data to shared memory if reused multiple times in computation.
