```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for groups by aligning data
// Use shared memory to cache col_widths for faster access within a block
// Consider using LDG (read-only) for col_widths and init_vals to optimize caching
// Consider splitting large kernel launches to avoid resource constraints
