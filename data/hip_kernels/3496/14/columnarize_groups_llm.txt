```
// Consider increasing block size to optimize memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to cache row data and reduce global memory access
// Experiment with loop unrolling for better performance if col_widths has fixed patterns
// Align data in memory to coalesce memory access
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for better cache hits if applicable
