```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// If possible, eliminate unnecessary branching within the kernel to improve performance
// Utilize __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal balance between occupancy and performance
