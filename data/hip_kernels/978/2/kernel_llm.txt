```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Minimize thread divergence by optimizing control flow
// Employ loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead
// Prefetch data to hide memory latency
// Align data structures to enable vectorized memory access
// Use warp-synchronous programming techniques
// Balance between computation and memory access within the kernel
