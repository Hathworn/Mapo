```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory performance
// Ensure shared memory is utilized effectively if multiple threads access the same data
// Optimize occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp
// Utilize warp shuffles for intra-warp communication
