```
// Use shared memory to store a tile of the data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having each thread access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
// Align thread block size to warp size to take full advantage of the hardware.
