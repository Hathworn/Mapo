```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved efficiency.
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory reads.
// Ensure all required halo elements are loaded into shared memory to avoid conditional branches.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded shared memory before computations begin.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing its size with precise indexing.
