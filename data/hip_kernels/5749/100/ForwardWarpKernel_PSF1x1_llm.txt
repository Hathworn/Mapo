```
// Combine boundary checks into one condition to reduce branching
// Pre-compute offsets to improve memory access efficiency
// Use __fmul_rn and __fadd_rn for more precise floating-point operations
// Use __float2int_rn for fast and accurate float to int conversions
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses
```
