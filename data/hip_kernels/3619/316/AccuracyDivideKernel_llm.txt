```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase memory coalescing
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives for efficient data manipulation
// Optimize the block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance
// Evaluate the use of half-precision floating point where applicable to reduce memory bandwidth
