```
// Optimize data access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access
// Consider using shared memory to buffer frequently accessed data
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointer parameters to improve compiler optimizations
// Implement loop unrolling manually if the scale_factor is known at compile-time
// Use atomic operations if necessary to prevent race conditions during the accumulation
