```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch neighboring elements to hide global memory latency
// Align data structures to achieve aligned memory accesses
// Check if more threads can be used to increase occupancy
