```c
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp efficiency.
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures for optimal memory access patterns.
// Launch kernels with a block size that maximizes occupancy and utilizes GPU resources efficiently.
