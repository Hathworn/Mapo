```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to indicate no aliasing.
// Optimize data access by ensuring memory coalescing when accessing dev_accumulate_weights and dev_accumulate_values.
// Consider using shared memory for values accessed multiple times within the same block to reduce global memory usage.
// Apply loop unrolling for operations within the kernel if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure that all device memory allocations are properly aligned for better access efficiency.
// Explore using asynchronous memory prefetching if supported by hardware, to hide memory access latency.
