```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for grad_x, grad_y, grad_z
// Consider loop unrolling for reduced computation overhead
// Optimize index calculation to minimize arithmetic operations
// Leverage warp-level primitives for efficient parallel reductions if applicable
// Explore the use of precision-specific functions for further optimization
