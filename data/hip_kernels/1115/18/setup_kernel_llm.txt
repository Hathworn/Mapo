```
// Use warp-level primitives for shuffle-based RNG initialization
// Align memory accesses for states array to improve coalesced access patterns
// Minimize shared memory usage by optimizing global memory access latency
// Consider using memory prefetching techniques for states to reduce access time
// Evaluate the use of unified memory for improved memory handling between host and device
// Investigate the use of loop unrolling for potential performance improvement
