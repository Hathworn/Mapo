// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to further enhance memory access efficiency
// Reduce memory transactions by minimizing redundant loads into registers
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives for possible speedup
