```
// Ensure data is coalesced in shared memory loads to minimize bank conflicts
// Consider using a larger TILE_WIDTH if registers and shared memory allow
// Loading a_index and b_index in loop can be improved by reducing redundant calculations
// Potentially use auto-implemented memory prefetching for better latency hiding
// Assess potential threading model to ensure sync points aren't bottlenecks
// Verify if shared memory allocation can be optimized for better occupancy
// Check if loop unrolling makes sense for the tile multiplication loop
