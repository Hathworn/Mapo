// Consolidate memory accesses to cudaA and cudaResult for better coalescing
// Utilize __shared__ memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve speed
// Handle boundary conditions efficiently and prevent redundant checks
// Ensure shared memory is used effectively and avoid bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling for the kernel application loops for performance gains
