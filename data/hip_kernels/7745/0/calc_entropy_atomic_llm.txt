```
// Consider using cooperative groups for synchronization to avoid unnecessary __syncthreads().
// Use cooperative shared memory to increase parallelism when accumulating sum.
// Consider using block-wide reductions in shared memory to compute sum and entropy more efficiently.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use float4 or float2 operations for coalesced memory access to float_image_in.
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance on the specific GPU architecture.
// Consider minimizing the use of atomic operations when possible to improve performance.
