// Consider using coalesced memory access by transposing input data
// Utilize shared memory more effectively to double buffer data
// Implement loop unrolling in the reduction phase for better performance
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing redundant synchronization calls
// Explore occupancy tuning to maximize GPU usage by adjusting block size
