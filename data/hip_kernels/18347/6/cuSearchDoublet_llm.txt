// Optimize shared memory usage and reduce unnecessary data transfer
// Minimizing atomic operations to reduce contention and improve performance
// Coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Avoiding redundant synchronization calls for improved warp execution efficiency
// Use loop unrolling techniques where appropriate for enhanced performance
// Align data structures to ensure memory access efficiency
