```
// Precompute scale factors and weights outside the loop to minimize redundant calculations
// Use texture cache efficiently to reduce memory access latency
// Combine texture fetches to minimize the number of operations
// Use conditional bitwise operations for efficient arithmetic operations
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring coherent execution paths
```
