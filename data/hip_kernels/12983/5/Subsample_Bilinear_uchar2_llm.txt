```c
// Use __ldg() intrinsic to cache global memory loads
// Ensure dst array accesses are coalesced to optimize memory throughput
// Consider replacing tex2D() with direct texture object sampling for performance
// Optimize memory access patterns to take advantage of "memory reuse" in shared memory
// Balance register usage to avoid spills and reduce warp divergence
// Consider using loop unrolling if texture fetching involves consistent pattern
```
