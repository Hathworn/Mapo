```
// Optimize memory access by using inline expressions to reduce intermediate variable dependencies.
// Balance the texture fetch workload to minimize divergent paths among threads.
// Ensure the use of fast intrinsic functions where applicable to enhance computational efficiency.
// Consider utilizing shared memory for repeated access data to enhance memory bandwidth utilization.
// Verify alignment and prefetch patterns to optimize global memory throughput.
// Exploit texture memory for read-only data to leverage cached memory benefits.
