// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access to the dst array.
// Pre-calculate hscale and vscale outside the loop if possible.
// Minimize branching by using conditional operators or moving conditions outside loops.
// Utilize texture caching to improve performance for repetitive read accesses.
