```
// Consider calculating num_threads_per_block and num_blocks once and passing it as kernel parameters.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously if thread synchronization is needed after the printf operations.
// Limit the usage of printf in device code for better performance.
// Evaluate the need for computing and printing gridDim and blockDim repetitively in all threads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns if accessing global memory in future expansions.
