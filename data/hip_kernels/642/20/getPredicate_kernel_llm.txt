```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring d_inVal and d_predVal are accessed consecutively.
// Align d_predVal data type with the architecture for better performance if possible.
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergence in control flow within the kernel.
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() if needed to prevent race conditions.
// Consider using shared memory for caching if appropriate for reducing global memory access.
