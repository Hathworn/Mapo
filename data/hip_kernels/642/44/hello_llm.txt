```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads and writes
// Minimize the use of printf in kernel to reduce overhead
// Evaluate thread block size to ensure maximum occupancy
// Leverage asynchronous data transfers to overlap computation with data movement if needed
// Ensure proper alignment of data to achieve optimal memory throughput
