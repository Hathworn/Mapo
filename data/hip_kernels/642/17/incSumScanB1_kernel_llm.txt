// Use coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory reads and writes.
// Consider using a larger block size to improve computational efficiency and reduce overhead.
// Use shared memory efficiently to avoid bank conflicts during inclusive scan operations.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
