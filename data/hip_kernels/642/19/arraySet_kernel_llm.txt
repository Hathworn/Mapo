```
// Consider using shared memory for frequent data access to improve memory bandwidth.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to reduce memory access latency.
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and improve performance.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
