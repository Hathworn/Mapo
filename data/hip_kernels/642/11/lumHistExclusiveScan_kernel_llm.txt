```
// Load input into shared memory in a coalesced manner to improve memory access patterns
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads by optimizing the loop structure
// Ensure optimal bank conflict resolution in shared memory accesses
// Consider using warp level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
