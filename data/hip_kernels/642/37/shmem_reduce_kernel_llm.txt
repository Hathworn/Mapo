// Consider coalescing memory access to d_in for more efficient memory transactions.
// Use __syncthreads() strategically to minimize stalls and maximize parallel execution.
// To increase occupancy, balance shared memory usage and register utilization.
// Ensure global memory access patterns are sequential to boost memory throughput.
// Consider using warp shuffles for reduction operations to minimize shared memory dependency.
