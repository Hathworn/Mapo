```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data like d_g, d_b for faster access
// Coalesce global memory accesses for d_r_output to improve memory throughput
// Aim for a higher occupancy by increasing block size or reducing register usage
```
