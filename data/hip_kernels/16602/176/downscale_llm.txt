```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Use launch configurations that are optimized for your specific GPU architecture.
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns.
// Add appropriate compiler flags to optimize performance further.
