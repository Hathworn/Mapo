```
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing access pattern
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Reduce redundant computation within kernel to optimize performance
// Evaluate use of constant memory for frequently accessed variables
// Minimize warp divergence to maintain efficiency
