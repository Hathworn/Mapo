```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory reads and writes.
// Consider using float4 or float2 loads/stores for better performance.
// Investigate shared memory bank conflicts and optimize layout if necessary.
// Minimize the number of reads and writes inside the loop for improved performance.
// Optimize the reduction by using warp-level primitives if applicable.
// Utilize loop unrolling effectively and ensure it matches the hardware capabilities.
// Further optimize global syncthreads by minimizing its usage or using efficient alternatives.
// Consider launching fewer threads or blocks if memory bandwidth is the bottleneck.
