```
// Consider using atomic operations for modifying accuracy to ensure data integrity.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if accuracy is computed per block first.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when possible.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
