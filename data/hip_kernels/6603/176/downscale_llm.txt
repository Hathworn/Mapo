```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to cache repeated global memory accesses to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure warp-aware memory access patterns to increase memory access efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously when using shared memory to ensure all threads have completed memory operations.
// Optimize thread block and grid size configuration to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency.
