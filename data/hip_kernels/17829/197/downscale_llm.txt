```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access.
// Organize threads in a way that ensures coalesced memory access.
// Avoid bank conflicts in any shared memory used.
// Reduce the number of divisions by storing precomputed strides.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to optimize intra-warp communication.
// Unroll loops to reduce the overhead of loop control and increase throughput.
// Use vectorized memory operations where possible to improve memory access efficiency.
// Prefer atomic operations when reducing results from different threads.
