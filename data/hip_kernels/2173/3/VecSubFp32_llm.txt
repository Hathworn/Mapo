```
// Consider coalesced memory access for input and output arrays
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses
// Verify memory alignment for better access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling if the operation is inside a larger loop
// Ensure that the global memory operations are coalesced
// Evaluate thread block size and grid size for optimum performance
