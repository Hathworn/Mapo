```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring in0, in1, and out are accessed consecutively.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to guarantee optimal performance.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Employ memory prefetching to hide memory latency where possible.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to minimize thread divergence.
