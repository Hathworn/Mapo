```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by using contiguous threads
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel for better performance
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize block and grid size configuration to maximize occupancy and efficient resource utilization
// Use asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation and data movement for better performance
