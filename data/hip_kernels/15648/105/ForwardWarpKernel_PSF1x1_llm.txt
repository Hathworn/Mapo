```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by organizing data layout to match thread access pattern.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Optimize memory usage by loading src values into registers, minimizing repeated global memory reads.
// Minimize divergent branches by reordering condition checks for early exits.
// Align memory allocations to memory transaction boundaries to improve access efficiency.
