// Consider using shared memory for normalization_factor to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize access patterns for coalesced memory access in global memory.
// Ensure all threads within a warp are performing similar operations to maximize warp efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead and improve performance.
