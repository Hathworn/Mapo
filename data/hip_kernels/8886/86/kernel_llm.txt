```c
// Use grid-stride loop to improve workload balance across blocks
// Prevent out-of-bounds access by using conditional checks
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Ensure all threads have loaded data with __syncthreads() before proceeding
// Perform parallel reduction to efficiently compute results
// Ensure synchronization at each step of the reduction with __syncthreads()
// Only one thread should update the global sum to avoid race conditions
