```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for loading A_k and u_shared
// Suggest to minimize shared memory usage where possible
// Evaluate using warp-level primitives for reduction operations to improve performance
// Investigate combining multiple global memory accesses into fewer transactions
// Consider loop unrolling to optimize reduction computation
// Assess whether using atomic operations might be beneficial for reduction results
// Look into using texture memory for frequently accessed data
