```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Evaluate if reducing the number of threads accessing global memory can improve performance
// Analyze occupancy to ensure optimal use of resources
// Check for coalesced memory access patterns
// Ensure that the kernel launch configuration is optimal for the hardware
