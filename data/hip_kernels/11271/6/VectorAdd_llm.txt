// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance
// Evaluate memory alignment for potential performance gain
// Explore the use of shared memory if applicable for intermediate computations
// Assess the kernel launch configuration to optimize block and thread utilization
// Check for potential bank conflicts in memory access
