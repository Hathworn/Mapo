```
// Use grid-stride loop to improve memory access patterns and load balancing
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing memory in a sequential pattern
// Consider using shared memory if intermediate computations are needed
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on hardware specifications for maximum occupancy
// Avoid bank conflicts if shared memory is used in advanced computations
