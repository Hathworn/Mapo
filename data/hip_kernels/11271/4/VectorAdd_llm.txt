```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers a, b, and c to improve memory access speed.
// Use shared memory if repeated access to elements within a block occurs.
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced memory access.
// Ensure memory access is aligned to improve performance.
