// Consider adjusting block size to better utilize shared memory and reduce overhead
// Ensure shared memory size does not exceed the maximum for the targeted device architecture
// Align shared memory accesses to optimize for memory coalescing
// Evaluate the use of registers to further optimize the memory access pattern
