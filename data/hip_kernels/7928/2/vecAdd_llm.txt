```
// Use shared memory to store input vectors for increased memory access speed
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve cache performance
// Reduce global memory accesses by combining computations into fewer steps
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for small reductions in register usage
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions for better load balancing and hardware utilization
