```
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure shared memory allocation size matches the required number of elements.
// Try partitioning shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts.
// Use __ldg() for read-only global memory reads to optimize cache use.
// Use loop unrolling in warp-level reduction for better performance.
