```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Calculate distances efficiently using bitwise operations
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning compare and swap operations
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance
// Reduce the number of synchronizations where possible for efficiency
