```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory usage
// Implement shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Ensure proper memory alignment for better access patterns
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring loop boundaries
// Use loop unrolling techniques for inner loop to enhance performance
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only accesses to d_g and d_b
