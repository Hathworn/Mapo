```
// Consider coalesced memory access by adjusting d_in access pattern
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses for reduction
// Optimize syncthreads placement to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure proper shared memory reuse after reduction steps
// Align shared memory size and data types to improve memory access patterns
