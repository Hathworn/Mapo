```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for log_Y values.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous threads access continuous memory locations.
// Pre-fetch data into registers to minimize latency from global memory access.
// Use constant memory for parameters like min_log_Y, max_log_Y, and log_Y_range if they remain constant.
// Consider using loop unrolling techniques if applicable for multiple operations per thread.
// Use float2 or float4 types to optimize memory bandwidth for reading d_x, d_y, d_log_Y, and storing d_r_new, d_g_new, d_b_new.
// Analyze the occupancy to ensure the kernel fully uses available GPU resources.
// Use warp shuffle operations instead of shared memory for small data required by multiple threads within a warp.
