// Calculate normalization constant once for the entire kernel to avoid redundant operations
// Use grid-stride loop for better performance and more flexibility in the number of threads
// Minimize memory accesses by calculating normalization constant outside the loop
// Maximize global memory throughput using coalesced memory accesses with a grid-stride loop
