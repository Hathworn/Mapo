```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory throughput
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching if applicable to hide latency
// Balance block size and grid size to fully utilize device resources
// Experiment with launching multiple streams for concurrent execution
```
