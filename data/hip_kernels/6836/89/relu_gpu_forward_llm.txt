```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Use shared memory to cache inputs if multiple operations are performed on them
// Ensure data is aligned to improve access speed
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to optimize performance
// Minimize use of global memory through effective use of registers and shared memory
// Align data structures in memory to match warp size for optimal performance
