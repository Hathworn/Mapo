// Consider coalesced memory access for nm2v_re and nm2v_im by aligning data structures.
// Optimize the range check to minimize warp divergence.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure blocks and threads are sized to maximize hardware utilization and occupancy.
