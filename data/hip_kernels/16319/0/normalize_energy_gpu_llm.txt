```
// Ensure efficient memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses for ksn2e and ksn2f
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for omega and denom calculations
// Consider loop unrolling where possible to enhance performance in the inner loop
// Try reducing register pressure by optimizing temporary variable usage such as alpha and beta
// Optimize the indexing calculation for nm2v_re and nm2v_im to improve memory access patterns
