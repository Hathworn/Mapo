```
// Optimize memory access by minimizing redundant reads and writes
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data like subArraySizeLocal if possible
// Implement coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Utilize loop unrolling to enhance temporal accumulation efficiency
// Consider using warp-level primitives for cooperative data manipulation
```
