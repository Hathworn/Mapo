// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to store subsections of Rmatrices when possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling in the for loop to improve performance
// Adjust grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and workload balance
