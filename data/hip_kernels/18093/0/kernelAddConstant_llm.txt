```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Aggregate multiple operations to minimize memory bandwidth
// Ensure memory coalescing for optimal global memory access patterns
// Use asynchronous memory copies to overlap computation and data transfer
// Align memory accesses to avoid memory access penalties
// Evaluate the necessity of __syncthreads() for memory consistency
