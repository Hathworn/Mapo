```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Utilize constant memory for read-only data that is accessed by all threads
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution performance
// Use asynchronous memory copies where applicable to overlap computation and data transfer
