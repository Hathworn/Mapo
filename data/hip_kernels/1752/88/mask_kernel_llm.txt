```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized memory loads/stores to optimize memory bandwidth
// Explore the use of memory coalescing to improve read/write efficiency
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure that the hardware is being fully utilized
