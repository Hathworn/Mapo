// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Improve warp utilization by aligning shared memory usage.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Opt for coalesced memory access patterns to enhance performance.
// Optimize stride-based access for better memory coalescing.
// Limit thread divergence for better performance.
