```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for storing the largest element
// Use atomicMax to safely find the maximum in shared memory
// Reduce the use of atomic operations for sum calculation to minimize serialization
// Consider warp-level primitives for faster reductions if hardware supports it
// Pre-compute repeated calculations outside loops when possible to reduce instruction count
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for input and output arrays for better bandwidth utilization
// Consider adjusting block size to maximize occupancy while ensuring sufficient parallelism for the work
