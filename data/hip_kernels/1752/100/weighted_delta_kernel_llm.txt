// Consider using shared memory for s[i] to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure all data structures are accessed in a coalesced manner to optimize memory bandwidth
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize global memory access latencies
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to optimize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
