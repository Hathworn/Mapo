```
// Avoid using mod operator inside loops for better performance.
// Pre-compute repetitive calculations outside nested loops to optimize access and reduce computation.
// Use shared memory for data_col if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns for data_col and data_im.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve execution efficiency.
// Optimize index calculations for reduced arithmetic operations and better performance.
