```
// Consider using shared memory to cache values of X for reuse by multiple threads in the same block
// Evaluate the use of coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Check the possibility of using memory prefetching to reduce latency
// Try aligning memory accesses to avoid misaligned accesses which may degrade performance
// Use appropriate data types for loading and storing operations to prevent type conversion overhead
