```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in X.
// Evaluate using shared memory if there are repeated memory reads by threads within a block to reduce global memory traffic.
// Use loop unrolling in the for-loop to utilize ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism) for better performance.
// Check if ALPHA is a compile-time constant to enable potential constant memory usage.
