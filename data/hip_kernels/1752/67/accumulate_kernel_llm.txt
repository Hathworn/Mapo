```cpp
// Ensure shared memory size is optimal for hardware resources
// Group accumulation using shared memory can reduce global memory accesses
// Synchronize all threads to ensure shared memory values are ready for aggregation
// Atomic operations ensure correct results when multiple threads update shared global memory
```
