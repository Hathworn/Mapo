```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Move invariant data like mean and variance to shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have copied data to shared memory
// Calculate indices locally to reduce repeated global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing accesses in inner loops
