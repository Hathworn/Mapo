// Use coalesced memory access patterns for arrays a, b, s, and c
// Ensure sufficient number of threads per block for warp efficiency
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data to registers before the main computation begins
// Avoid unnecessary checks and calculations within the kernel loop
// Optimize memory bandwidth by aligning data structures
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
