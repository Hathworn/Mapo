```
// Consider coalescing global memory access to the delta array.
// Use shared memory efficiently by reducing bank conflicts.
// Ensure all threads in a block contribute before synchronization.
// Minimize the number of synchronizations to reduce overhead.
// Optimize loop unrolling if the spatial dimension size is known.
// Ensure the use of math operations that avoid precision loss.
