```
// Use shared memory to cache data loading for threads to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data loads to warp-sized chunks.
// Consider loop unrolling for inner loops to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Apply vectorized loads and stores when possible for better throughput.
// Reduce the number of atomic operations if feasible to enhance kernel performance.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to utilize fast shared memory operations.
