```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Investigate whether using more shared memory optimizations would enhance performance
// Use loop unrolling in the innermost loop for potential performance gain
// Optimize data fetching to ensure all memory accesses are coalesced
// Evaluate whether reducing the number of calculations per thread benefits speed
