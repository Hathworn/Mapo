```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning input and output arrays to warp boundaries if possible.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where feasible.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring no two threads in the same warp access the same memory bank simultaneously.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to fully utilize the hardware capabilities and ensure maximum occupancy.
