```c
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory accesses to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Explore loop unrolling further if profile data suggests bottlenecks in computation.
// Ensure threads within a warp process consecutive data elements to optimize for memory throughput.
// Investigate the use of texture memory for read-only data if applicable.
