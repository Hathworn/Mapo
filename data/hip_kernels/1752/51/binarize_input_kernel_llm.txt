```
// Consider optimizing memory usage by utilizing shared memory more effectively for parallel reduction.
// Investigate coalesced memory access patterns to enhance memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed limits to prevent bank conflicts.
// Utilize __syncthreads() only when necessary to minimize warp serialization.
// Consider loop unrolling for reduction within each block to increase performance.
