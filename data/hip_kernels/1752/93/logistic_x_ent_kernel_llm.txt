```
// Consider coalesced memory access for pred, truth, delta, and error arrays
// Ensure alignment of data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Use shared memory if repeated access to the same data is required across threads
// Minimize branch divergence within the kernel
// Pre-fetch data to reduce latency
