```
// Consider increasing block size to improve parallelism
// Ensure sufficient shared memory is allocated for the largest block size
// Unroll the loop further to maximize performance
// Ensure memory coalescing, align memory accesses to reduce global memory transactions
// Use warp shuffle for reduction to minimize shared memory usage
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access
