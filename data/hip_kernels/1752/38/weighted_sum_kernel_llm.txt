```
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns for arrays a, b, s, and c
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Perform loop unrolling inside the kernel where appropriate for better performance
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to reduce memory fetch overhead
// Optimize conditional checks to minimize divergence in the warp
