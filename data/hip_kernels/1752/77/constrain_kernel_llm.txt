```
// Optimize memory access pattern by ensuring coalesced access to X
// Utilize shared memory if there are frequent global memory accesses
// Minimize the arithmetic intensity by reducing redundant calculations
// Consider loop unrolling if INCX is a constant and is greater than one
// Align memory accesses if possible to enhance memory throughput
