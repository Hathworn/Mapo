```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to minimize global memory accesses
// Loop unrolling in the spatial dimension to improve memory access pattern
// Utilize parallel reduction to efficiently sum values in shared memory
// Unroll final reduction step to maintain full warp utilization for optimization
