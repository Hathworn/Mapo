```
// Consider using shared memory for data that's accessed multiple times to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by rearranging data for better cache utilization.
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring the if-else logic to execute uniformly across threads.
// Investigate unrolling loops if applicable for better instruction throughput.
// Optimize index computations to reduce arithmetic operations and improve execution efficiency.
