```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for delta to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure enough shared memory allocation for shared_sum to avoid bank conflicts
// Try to minimize atomic operations or use warp-level reductions for better performance
// Align block size with the hardware's warp size to maximize parallel efficiency
