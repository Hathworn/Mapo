```
// Use shared memory for partial sum accumulation if fitting in shared memory
// Consider use of float2 for loading into registers to optimize memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for the variable x
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could provide better performance for inner loop
// Assess warp divergence and try to minimize it
