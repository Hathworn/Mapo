```
// Use loop unrolling to reduce overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Employ shared memory for intermediate sums to minimize global memory accesses.
// Apply a reduction step in shared memory to optimize parallel sum computation.
// Synchronize threads to ensure data integrity before and after reduction steps.
// Merge global memory access where possible to take advantage of coalesced memory transactions.
