```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for x by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Evaluate use of shared memory for storing mean and variance to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure enough threads per block to mask memory latencies and maximize occupancy
// Use __syncthreads() if shared memory is implemented to ensure data consistency across threads
// Minimize use of magic numbers; consider defining 0.000001f as a constant for better maintainability
