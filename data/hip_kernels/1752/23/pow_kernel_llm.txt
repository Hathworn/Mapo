// Use shared memory to cache X values for faster repeated access
// Consider coalesced memory access for X and Y to improve memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism
// Evaluate the use of warp divergence to optimize execution efficiency
