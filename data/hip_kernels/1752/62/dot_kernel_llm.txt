// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate sums and norms to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns for both output and delta arrays.
// Avoid redundant calculations within loops, such as computing the same index multiple times.
// Check if loop unrolling could improve the performance in the inner loop of size dimension.
