// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced
// Minimize use of division and modulus by using loop unrolling or pre-calculation
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory load
// Reduce conditional checks within inner loops to streamline memory access operations
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize GPU utilization and minimize idle threads
