```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring INCX is 1 to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Add shared memory to store portions of X for each block to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize divergence by avoiding complex conditionals within the kernel, if applicable
// Ensure that the memory access pattern allows for vectorized loads if possible
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointer parameters to help compiler optimization
// Reduce register usage by minimizing local variable count or reusing variables
