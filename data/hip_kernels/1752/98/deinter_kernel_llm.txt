```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if the same data is accessed multiple times
// Reduce divergent branches by consolidating if conditions if possible
// Minimize warp divergence in the if-else conditions to improve performance
// Ensure optimal block and grid size to maximize occupancy and context switches
