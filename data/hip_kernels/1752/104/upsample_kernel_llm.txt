```c
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if there's reuse of x or out values within a block
// Reduce global memory accesses by loading data into registers when possible
// Minimize divergent branching or conditionals within kernel
// Align data structures to optimal memory boundary for better access speed
// Consider loop unrolling if iterative patterns are present
```
