// Improve memory access patterns for higher coalescing.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like variance and mean.
// Use a larger tile size where possible to increase data locality.
// Avoid redundant boundary checks by structuring loops efficiently.
// Investigate use of texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of caching.
