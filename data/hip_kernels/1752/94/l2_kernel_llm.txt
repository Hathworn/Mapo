```
// Use shared memory to load data in blocks for coalesced access
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by padding
// Ensure data reuse in registers to reduce global memory reads
// Use vectorized load/store operations where possible
// Avoid warp divergence by aligning conditional checks
// Optimize block and grid size for maximum occupancy
// Balance between thread work and memory access latency
