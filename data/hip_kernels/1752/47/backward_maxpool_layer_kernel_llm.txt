```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced wherever possible
// Loop unrolling can be used for the loops over `l` and `m`
// Minimize conditional statements inside nested loops
// Consider using warp level primitives for reduction operations
