// Ensure coalesced memory access by using thread and block indices efficiently
// Utilize shared memory if possible to store intermediate values for reduction in global memory accesses
// Precompute and reuse common expressions within the kernel to reduce redundant calculations
// Use appropriate mathematical functions to minimize precision errors
// Leverage stream or asynchronous memory operations for overlapping computations and data transfers
