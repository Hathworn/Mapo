```
// Precompute global memory indices outside the loop to reduce arithmetic operations
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Minimize divergent branching by checking bounds outside the main operations if possible
// Leverage shared memory if multiple threads access nearby data to improve cache hit rates
