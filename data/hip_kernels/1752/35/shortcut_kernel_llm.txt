```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for better memory access patterns.
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations.
// Optimize register usage to reduce the number of register spills.
// Ensure memory access is aligned to 32-bit or 64-bit as appropriate.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to enable the compiler to perform more aggressive optimizations.
// Minimize warp divergence by structuring parallel loops efficiently.
