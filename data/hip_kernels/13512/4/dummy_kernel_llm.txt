```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by using shared memory for data reuse.
// Use appropriate memory access patterns to optimize global memory read/write.
// Reduce register pressure by optimizing loop unrolling and minimizing variable usage.
// Ensure memory alignment for efficient memory access and avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to improve memory bandwidth.
