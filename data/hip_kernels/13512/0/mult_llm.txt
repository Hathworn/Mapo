```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access for faster memory operations
// Employ loop unrolling to improve computation efficiency
// Consider larger block sizes for improved parallelism
// Minimize conditional branching for enhanced warp execution
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed data
```
