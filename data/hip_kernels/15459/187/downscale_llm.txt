```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses where possible.
// Optimize the thread block size to maximize occupancy and minimize memory latency.
// Use __syncthreads() if shared memory is utilized to avoid race conditions.
// Evaluate if further loop unrolling is beneficial for performance.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for intra-warp communication.
