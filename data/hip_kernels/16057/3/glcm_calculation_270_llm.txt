```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better memory throughput.
// Align data structures with cache line boundaries to improve cache performance.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations, as they can be slow and cause serialization.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic.
// Experiment with block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and load balance.
