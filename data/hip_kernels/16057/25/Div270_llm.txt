```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses where possible for improved performance.
// Ensure that memory accesses are contiguous to optimize the memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if there's any spatial or temporal reuse.
// Minimize use of atomic operations or ensure they are on low-contention areas to reduce performance bottlenecks.
