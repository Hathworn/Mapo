// Utilize shared memory for glcm to improve memory access speed
// Load glcm values into shared memory before processing
// Synchronize threads after storing values in shared memory
// Use shared memory instead of global memory during normalization
// Avoid unnecessary conversions by ensuring operations remain in float where possible
