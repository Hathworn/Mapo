```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved global memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses within the loop.
// Optimize atomic operations to minimize performance overhead in the ASM computation.
// Launch kernels with appropriate block and grid sizes to achieve maximum occupancy.
