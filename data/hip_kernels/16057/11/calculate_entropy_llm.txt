```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by ensuring adjacent threads access adjacent memory addresses
// Use float instead of float in shared memory to ensure higher precision in calculations
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses within the while loop by caching necessary values in registers
// Utilize warp-level primitives to perform reduction more efficiently rather than using shared memory for reduction
// Eliminate unnecessary __syncthreads() for better warp execution efficiency
// Avoid printf statements inside kernel for performance critical sections
