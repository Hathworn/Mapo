```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory for more efficient data access
// Consider loop unrolling for small loops to reduce loop overhead
// Use on-chip memory as much as possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure threads within a warp are doing similar amounts of work to maximize warp efficiency
