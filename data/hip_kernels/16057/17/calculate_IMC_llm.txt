```c
// Use of atomic operations on px and py arrays can lead to serialization, consider using warp-level primitives if possible.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used correctly, as improper use can lead to undefined behavior or performance issues.
// Avoid recalculating log_value, store it in a register for reuse in multiple expressions.
// Consider using shared memory for px and py arrays to reduce global memory access.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of unrolling the loop that updates HXY to improve performance.
// Ensure loop conditions and memory accesses are coalesced for better memory throughput in the for loop.
// Reconsider the thread block and grid size to ensure maximum occupancy based on your specific GPU architecture.
