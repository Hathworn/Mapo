```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed GLCM values to reduce global memory access
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for loading data from global memory to improve bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Evaluate if increasing the number of threads per block can improve occupancy and performance
// Avoid unnecessary conditional statements within the loop to reduce divergent branching
