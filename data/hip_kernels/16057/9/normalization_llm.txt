```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for glcm and norm pointers for better memory access optimization
// Optimize memory access pattern by ensuring coalesced access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction if further reductions are required
// Evaluate potential benefits of occupancy increase by tuning block and grid dimensions
