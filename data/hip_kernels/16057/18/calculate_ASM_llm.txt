// Consider using shared memory to cache norm values for faster access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a consecutive manner.
// Reduce thread divergence by balancing the workload across threads.
// Optimize parallel reduction by using warp-level operations if possible.
// Use atomic operations if necessary to safely sum values across blocks.
