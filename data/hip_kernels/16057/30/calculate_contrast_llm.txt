```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate values for in-block reduction.
// Minimize global memory accesses by reorganizing data access patterns.
// Align data structures to improve coalesced memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced in the for-loop by adjusting the index calculations.
