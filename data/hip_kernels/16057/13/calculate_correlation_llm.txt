```c
// Avoid redundant calculations by moving invariant code outside loops where possible
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to help the compiler with memory aliasing optimizations
// Convert using shared memory for often-accessed data within threads to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory with contiguous threads
// Consider loop unrolling for the small fixed-size loops to potential gain performance
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by padding shared memory arrays
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead for reduction operations
// Ensure synchronization is necessary before __syncthreads() to avoid overhead
// Check if all threads are used effectively, and reduce unused threads in each block if any
