```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory performance.
// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce redundant global memory access.
// Align data types where possible to ensure optimal memory transaction size.
// Leverage warp-level primitives, like __shfl_down_sync, for optimization in reduction step.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization when possible to reduce overhead.
