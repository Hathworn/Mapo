```c
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize the use of atomic operations due to their high cost
// Ensure that all memory accesses are aligned for peak efficiency
// Avoid using printf in device code for performance reasons
```
