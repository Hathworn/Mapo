```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve performance
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() when using shared memory
// Adjust shared memory size to fit data and avoid unnecessary wastage
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads/writes
// Utilize more threads per block if occupancy allows to hide memory latency
// Check shared memory bank conflicts and adjust indices to avoid them
```
