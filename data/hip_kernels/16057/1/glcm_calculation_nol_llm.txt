```
// Consider coalesced global memory access to improve performance.
// Optimize memory allocation by reducing the bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Assess use of shared memory size for the specific value of maxx.
// Ensure minimal usage of atomic operations for better efficiency.
// Analyze if thread synchronization (__syncthreads) can be minimized.
// Evaluate if glcm can be initialized in parallel to decrease initialization time.
