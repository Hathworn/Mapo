```
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Combine multiple atomic operations if possible to reduce collision
// Check whether loop unrolling can minimize overhead and increase performance
// Consider reducing atomic operations by computing results locally if feasible
