```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing for global reads by aligning data structures
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditional statements
// Optimize block size for better occupancy and throughput
// Experiment with loop unrolling if applicable to reduce control overhead
