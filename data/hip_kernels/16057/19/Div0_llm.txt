// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve throughput.
// Reduce thread divergence by structuring control flow to predict branches better.
// Consider loop unrolling for the for-loop to minimize overhead in loop control.
