// Use memory coalescing to improve global memory access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant memory access for common calculations.
// Utilize constant memory for invariant values accessed by all threads that do not change.
// Align data allocation to improve efficiency in accessing memory.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput.
