// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize coalesced reads.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables or blocks.
// Ensure __fmaf_rn intrinsics are utilized effectively for fused multiply-add operations.
// Apply boundary checks early to exit threads, minimizing warp divergence.
// Evaluate data alignment and size of u, v, and src arrays to ensure efficient memory operations.
// Minimize conditional branches by restructuring the code where possible.
