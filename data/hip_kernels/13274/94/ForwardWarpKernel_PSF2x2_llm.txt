```
// Use shared memory to cache u, v, and src blocks to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for src and dst to improve read and write efficiency.
// Experiment with adjusting block size and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy and throughput.
// Explore the use of vectorized data types (e.g., float4) if applicable to the data layout.
// For atomicAdd operations, ensure consistent memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts.
