// Consider using shared memory to cache normalization_factor values for threads within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Use __restrict__ keyword on pointer arguments for potential performance gain if data does not overlap.
// Evaluate potential bank conflicts in shared memory and use padding if necessary to optimize memory access.
