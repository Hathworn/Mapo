```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Consider using loop unrolling for better performance in certain scenarios.
// Ensure proper thread block size to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency.
