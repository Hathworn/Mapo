```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Prefetch data for next iteration if applicable, improving memory throughput.
// Use vectorized loads/stores if supported by hardware for higher efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Explore using asynchronous data transfers for overlapping computation and communication.
