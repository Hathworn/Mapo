```
// Cache frequently accessed variables in registers to minimize global memory access
// Use shared memory to accumulate intermediate results and reduce global memory operations
// Ensure shared memory usage is compliant with maximum shared memory availability per block
// Minimize atomic operations by using shared memory for intermediate accumulation
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have copied their results to shared memory before writing back to global memory
// Consider optimal block size to maximize occupancy while keeping within shared memory limits
