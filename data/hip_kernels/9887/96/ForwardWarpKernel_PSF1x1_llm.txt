```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'u' and 'v' arrays.
// Optimize shared memory usage for 'src' to reduce repetitive global memory access.
// Use vectorized loads if possible to enhance memory load efficiency for 'u', 'v', and 'src'.
// Ensure 'dst' memory writes are coalesced by aligning accesses in memory.
// Evaluate using texture memory for read-only data like 'src' for cache benefits.
