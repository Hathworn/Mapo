```
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data accesses to memory warp boundaries
// Apply loop unrolling, if applicable, for computational blocks to reduce loop overhead
// Consider memory access pattern changes, such as transposing the data layout for optimized access
