```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize memory divergence by coalescing memory accesses.
// Optimize the grid and block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Utilize warp shuffle instructions for inter-thread communication if necessary.
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput, if applicable.
// Double-check for any unnecessary memory barriers and remove them.
// Ensure that textures or surfaces are used optimally, if applicable.
