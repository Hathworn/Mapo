```cpp
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory or registers
// Unroll loops to improve performance and potentially leverage ILP
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning accesses across threads
// Consider caching repeated calculations in registers
// Use occupancy calculator to find optimal block and grid size
```
