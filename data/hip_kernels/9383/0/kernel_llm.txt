// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for coalescing.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to improve cache utilization.
// Analyze the possibility of using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Evaluate the use of read-only data cache for constant data.
// Investigate potential benefits of loop unrolling for computational parts.
// Consider reducing global memory accesses by using registers efficiently.
