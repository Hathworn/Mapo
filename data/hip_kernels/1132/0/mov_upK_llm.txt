// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for matriz by accessing consecutive elements
// Consider shared memory for frequently accessed data within the warp
// Reduce the number of syncthreads to enhance performance, ensuring correctness
// Utilize loop unrolling where applicable for better loop performance
// Fuse consecutive kernel calls if possible to minimize kernel launch overhead
