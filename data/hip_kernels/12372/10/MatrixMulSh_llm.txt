// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for global memory reads and writes.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Maximize occupancy to ensure better use of GPU resources.
// Ensure that TILE_WIDTH divides WIDTH evenly, or handle edge cases properly.
// Optimize synchronizations by minimizing __syncthreads() calls.
