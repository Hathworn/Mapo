// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Use memory coalescing techniques to enhance data access patterns.
// Optimize loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase parallel efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives to optimize intra-warp cooperation.
