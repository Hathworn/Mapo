```cpp
// Use shared memory for better memory access performance
// Ensure shared memory initialization is optimized for subsequent computations
// Simplify parallel operations using shared memory to reduce global memory requests
// Optimize syncthreads placement to minimize thread divergence
// Reduce global memory writes by utilizing shared_data for temporary storage
```
