```
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse when applicable
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Make use of appropriate memory spaces (e.g., registers) to reduce global memory access
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for efficient hardware utilization
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to reduce contention
