```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Load tiles of size 32x32 from global to shared memory for both matrices.
// Ensure threads only access valid elements for potential out-of-bounds areas.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before computation.
// Use loop unrolling to enhance compute efficiency within tile computation.
