// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data structures appropriately
// Minimize global memory access within the kernel by reusing data in registers
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory fetches
// Optimize memory bandwidth by aligning data access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce branch divergence
// Minimize synchronization points and use warp-level operations where possible
