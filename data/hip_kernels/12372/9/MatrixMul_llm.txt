```cpp
// Use shared memory to store sub-matrices of Md and Nd to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading Md and Nd into shared memory.
// Optimize synchronization by minimizing the number of __syncthreads() calls.
// Ensure coalesced memory write when storing the result in Pd.
// Consider adjusting TILE_WIDTH to maximize occupancy and performance.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
