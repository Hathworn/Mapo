```
// Precompute index to minimize repeated calculations
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all thread computations are complete before reduction
// Use a single thread for reduction to minimize thread divergence
// Write results back to global memory in a coalesced manner
```
