// Consider using shared memory for input1 and input2 to reduce global memory access latency.
// Unroll the loop for the computation operation to enhance performance.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Verify alignment of memory access for efficient data transaction.
