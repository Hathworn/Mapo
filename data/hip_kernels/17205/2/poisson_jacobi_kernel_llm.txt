```
// Use shared memory to cache neighborhoods for faster access
// Use float instead of double for neighbor_sum to maintain consistency and improve performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses for both targetimg and outimg
// Consider loop unrolling for 'channel' loop to reduce loop overhead
