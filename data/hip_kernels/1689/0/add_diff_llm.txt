```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Use shared memory if possible to further reduce global memory access latency
// Experiment with varying block and grid sizes to find optimal performance
// Consider using memory prefetching to overlap computation and memory transfers
// Ensure memory alignment to prevent unnecessary memory transactions
```
