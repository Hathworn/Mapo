```
// Consider using __ldg to load data if it is read-only and accessed multiple times.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting and aligning data structures.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data within threads.
// Apply loop unrolling pragmatically to accelerate frequent operations.
// Minimize divergence by carefully structuring control flows.
// Evaluate memory bank conflicts in shared memory usage scenarios.
// Check if atomic operations can be minimized or replaced for higher performance.
// Consider optimizing for occupancy by fine-tuning block and grid sizes.
