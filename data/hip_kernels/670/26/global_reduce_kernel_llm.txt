```
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning d_in and d_out
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory effectively
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce synchronization overhead
// Evaluate performance implications of different block sizes
