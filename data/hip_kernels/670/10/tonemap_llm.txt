```
// Improve memory coalescing by reordering data access patterns if possible
// Explore shared memory for frequently reused values such as inv_log_Y_range
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce redundant calculations in SIMD fashion
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like d_cdf_norm to optimize cached access
// Analyze thread block size and grid size to optimize occupancy and load balancing
