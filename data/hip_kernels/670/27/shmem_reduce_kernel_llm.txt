```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize branching and instruction overhead.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage to reduce synchronization cost.
// Align global memory access to optimize performance.
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits.
