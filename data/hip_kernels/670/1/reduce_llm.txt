```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for d_in to improve memory throughput
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on d_in and d_out_shared for improved compiler optimizations
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by selecting an appropriate block size
// Use appropriate memory access patterns to minimize global memory access latency
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Balance the number of threads per block and shared memory usage to maximize performance
