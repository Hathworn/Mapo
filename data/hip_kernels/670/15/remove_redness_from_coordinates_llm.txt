// Use loop fusion to reduce redundant iterations and improve performance.
// Minimize divergent branches by clamping boundaries efficiently.
// Optimize global memory access by coalescing d_g and d_b reads.
// Pre-calculate gb_average to reduce repeated computations and save instructions.
// Ensure coalesced writes to d_r_output for better memory throughput.
