// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_in to enhance memory throughput
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for d_bins
// Analyze occupancy and consider fine-tuning block and grid dimensions for better performance
// Profile the kernel to detect any warp divergence and restructure code to minimize it
