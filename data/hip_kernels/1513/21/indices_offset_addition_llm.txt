```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loading offsets into shared memory
// Ensure __syncthreads() is correctly placed to avoid race conditions
// Optimize memory access in the loop by using shared memory for offset addition
// Reduce global memory accesses by caching values in shared memory and registers
// Consider using warp-shuffle instructions for more efficient memory operations
