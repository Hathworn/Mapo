```c
// Cache sequence lengths in registers to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory transactions.
// Utilize atomic operations sparingly to prevent performance bottlenecks.
// Align memory accesses to increase transaction efficiency and coalescing.
// Balance workload across threads to avoid warp divergence.
