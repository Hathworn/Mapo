```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize shared memory loading
// Limit the number of active threads to those required for the computation
// Apply atomic operations efficiently to avoid race conditions
```
