// Prefer shared memory for reducing repeated global memory reads
// Ensure full utilization of thread and block resources
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning shared memory accesses
// Avoid unnecessary division operations by reusing computed inverse results
// Consider loop unrolling for further performance improvements
