```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data structures for coalesced memory access
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce latency in subsequent operations
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and enhance performance
