```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access times for gradients
// Ensure __syncthreads() is placed correctly to synchronize shared memory loading
// Optimize global memory access by coalescing wherever possible
// Consider increasing memory access patterns to fully utilize available memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergence in control flow statements for better warp execution
// Utilize shared memory effectively to store frequently accessed data
// Align data structures in memory to benefit from coalesced access
