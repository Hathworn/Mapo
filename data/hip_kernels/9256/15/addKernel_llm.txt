// Consider optimizing the use of shared memory to minimize bank conflicts.
// Align shared memory access patterns for higher coalescing efficiency.
// Ensure that the global memory accesses are coalesced for maximum bandwidth.
// Use __syncthreads() only where necessary to reduce synchronization overhead.
