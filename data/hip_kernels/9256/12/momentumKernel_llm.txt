```
// Reduce global memory accesses by caching frequently accessed values in shared memory
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for parameterIndices and counts arrays
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by proper alignment of accesses
// Use atomic operations efficiently to avoid race conditions when updating shared data
// Optimize loop iteration for warp efficiency by aligning loop bounds to warp size
// Explore use of memory fences to ensure proper memory synchronization among threads
// Investigate loop unrolling for further optimization of repeated operations
