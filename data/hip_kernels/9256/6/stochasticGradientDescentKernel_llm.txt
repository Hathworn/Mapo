```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'parameters' and 'gradient' arrays.
// Unroll the loop to align with warp size and maximize memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory for 'parameters' and 'gradient' to reduce global memory access latency.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce memory latency.
// Align data structures to 16-byte boundaries for better memory access efficiency.
// Use half precision if possible to reduce memory bandwidth pressure.
