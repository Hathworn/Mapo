```
// Use shared memory to cache predictions and targets for better memory access patterns
// Consider coalesced memory access by arranging data layout to minimize memory bandwidth
// Evaluate warp divergence impacts and attempt optimization using logical restructuring
// Experiment with varying block and grid sizes to identify optimal configuration
// Profile the kernel to identify hotspots and focus optimization on critical sections
// Explore asynchronous memory copies to overlap computation and memory transfer
