```
// Pre-compute reused values outside the conditional to reduce redundant calculations
// Simplify conditional checks to minimize execution branches
// Use float literals (e.g., 0.0f) consistently for better performance
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to optimize memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory if repeated accesses to global memory are detected
// Maintain alignment in memory accesses for improved efficiency
