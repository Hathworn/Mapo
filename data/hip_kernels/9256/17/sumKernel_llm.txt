```
// Load entry variable into registers to minimize memory access.
// Utilize shared memory to cache input data to optimize block-level memory access.
// Ensure that the size of shared memory allocation considers maximum possible values from batchSize and numberEntries to avoid overflow.
// Employ __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory before proceeding.
// Align access patterns to shared and global memory to improve coalescing and reduce memory access latency.
