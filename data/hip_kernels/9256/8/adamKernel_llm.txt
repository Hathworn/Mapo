// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access for gradient and parameters arrays
// Consider prefetching data to improve memory access latency
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to optimize parallel execution
// Consider using atomic operations if necessary to avoid race conditions when updating shared data
