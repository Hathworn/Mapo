```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory load efficiency
// Align the data structures to avoid misaligned memory accesses
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed variables
// Ensure memory transactions are minimized for gradients and parameters
// Employ loop unrolling to maximize instruction throughput
