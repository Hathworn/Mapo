// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'predictions' and 'targets' arrays
// Use shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data
// Consider using warp-level intrinsics for reduction operations
// Minimize thread divergence within a warp by organizing condition checks
// Optimize memory layout to favor linear access patterns
