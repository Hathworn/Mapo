```c
// Use coalesced memory accesses when reading from and writing to global memory
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce shared memory usage
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Analyze occupancy to ensure optimal use of the GPU resources
