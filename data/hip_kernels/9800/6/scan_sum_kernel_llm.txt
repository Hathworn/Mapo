```
// Use shared memory for input_vals to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure shared memory banks are accessed without conflicts.
// Consider loop unrolling in the inclusive prefix sum computation for improved performance.
// Coalescing global memory writes to output array for efficient memory access.
// Use warp shuffle instructions if possible to optimize prefix sum operation.
