// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve performance  
// Initialize shared memory bins to reduce global memory overhead  
// Use atomic operations in shared memory to ensure data consistency without global memory contention  
// Write aggregated results from shared memory back to global memory efficiently
