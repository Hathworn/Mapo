```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by aligning thread operations
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Check if the normalization constant computation can be precomputed or cached to avoid redundancy
// Consider loop unrolling for processing elements within bounds to improve performance
