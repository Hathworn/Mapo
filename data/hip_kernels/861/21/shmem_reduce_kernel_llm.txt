// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Synchronize threads to ensure correct loading into shared memory
// Unroll loops to minimize thread divergence and improve throughput
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() within warp for efficiency
// Optimize warp unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure atomic access when writing block results to global memory
