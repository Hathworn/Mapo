```
// Consider using shared memory for d_bins to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by proper memory alignment
// Optimize memory coalescing by adjusting data access patterns in d_in
// Use multiple threads to increase parallelism for updating bins
// Check if loop unrolling can enhance performance for atomic operations
