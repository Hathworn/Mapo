```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access pattern by coalescing and reducing strided accesses
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditional logic
// Use texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of caching
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable for performance gain
