```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from d_coordinates
// Minimize divergent branching by simplifying clamping logic
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory loads
// Consider loop unrolling for both x and y offsets for better instruction throughput
// Avoid recalculating the same indices by moving invariant calculations outside the loops
