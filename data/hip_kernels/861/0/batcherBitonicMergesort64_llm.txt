```
// Consider optimizing memory access by using coalesced memory accesses for d_in and d_out
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by addressing sdata indices in a structured access pattern
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead for the inner substage loop
// Consider leveraging warp shuffle operations for communication instead of shared memory for small stages
// Evaluate using half precision floats if precision requirements permit for increased throughput
