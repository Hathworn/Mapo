// Consider using shared memory for reducing global memory accesses.
// Ensure data is coalesced when accessing global memory.
// Minimize thread divergence by structuring conditional statements uniformly.
// Use efficient memory access patterns to improve cache usage.
// Reduce the number of synchronizations if possible to minimize overhead.
