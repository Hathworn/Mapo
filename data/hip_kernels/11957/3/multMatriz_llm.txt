// Consider using shared memory to cache elements that are accessed multiple times, such as da and db, to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by organizing data to be accessed by consecutive threads efficiently.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling could be beneficial to improve instruction throughput for the inner loop.
