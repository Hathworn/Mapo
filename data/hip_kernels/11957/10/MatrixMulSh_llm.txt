```
// Consider increasing TILE_WIDTH for better utilization of shared memory if registers are available
// Ensure matrices Md and Nd are aligned in memory for coalesced access
// Consider using float4 for loading data for coalesced access and reduced instruction count
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by padding shared memory arrays if needed
// Balance between computation and memory transfer to optimize for memory bandwidth
// Try tuning grid and block sizes to find the optimal configuration for the target device
// Use __ldg() for read-only data accesses from global memory if applicable and beneficial
// Double-check for potential warp divergence in the control flow or loop iterations
