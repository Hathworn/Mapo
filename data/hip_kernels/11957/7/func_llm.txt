```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Load data efficiently to shared memory to minimize latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading to shared memory
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads after loading data
// Optimize computations using shared memory to reduce recomputation
// Consider using vector operations if applicable to enhance throughput
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads before storing data back
