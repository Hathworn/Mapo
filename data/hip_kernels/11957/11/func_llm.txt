// Use grid-stride loops for efficient handling of large data sizes
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Use asynchronous data transfers to overlap computation with communication
// Avoid divergent branches within the kernel for better warp execution efficiency
