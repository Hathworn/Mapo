```c
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align memory access patterns to enhance coalesced memory access.
// Minimize thread divergence in control flow statements.
// Optimize usage of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for further optimizations.
