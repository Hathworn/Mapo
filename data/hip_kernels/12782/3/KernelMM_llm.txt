```
// Optimize: Consider using loop unrolling in the inner loop for improved performance
// Optimize: Use vectorized memory loads if possible for faster memory access
// Optimize: Ensure data is coalesced in global memory access for optimal performance
// Optimize: Maximize occupancy by choosing TILE_SIZE to fit shared memory constraints
