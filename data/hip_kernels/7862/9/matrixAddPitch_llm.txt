```
// Consider using shared memory for better memory coalescing.
// Optimize pitch to match memory alignment for faster access.
// Use loop unrolling if computation per thread is significant.
// Verify if memory access patterns fully utilize L2 cache.
// Evaluate necessity of boundary check to possibly reduce conditional branches.
