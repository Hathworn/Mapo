```cpp
// Optimize memory coalescing for global memory accesses
// Use shared memory to improve data locality and reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions within shared memory
// Consider increasing TILE_DIM to improve cache utilization if resources allow
```
