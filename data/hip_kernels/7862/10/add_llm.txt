```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure proper occupancy by selecting optimal block size for better parallelism.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that threads within a warp follow similar code paths.
// Analyze memory access patterns to reduce cache misses.
