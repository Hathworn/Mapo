```
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to better utilize the GPU
// Load input elements to shared memory in coalesced manner for better memory access performance
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage for optimizing synchronization overhead
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory throughput
