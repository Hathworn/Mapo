```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data values utilized in the loop
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access consecutive memory addresses in gradInput_data
// Minimize memory transactions by using float4 or other vectorized types if possible
// Consider loop unrolling for the accumulation loop to enhance performance
// Ensure adequate occupancy by adjusting block size and utilizing __launch_bounds__ if necessary
// Prefetch data to registers before the accumulation loop to reduce memory latency
