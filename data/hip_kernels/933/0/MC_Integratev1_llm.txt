```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for 'degrees' array within a block.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring 'degrees' access is aligned with thread ID.
// Use fewer registers per thread to increase occupancy and improve throughput.
// Unroll loops if dimensions and n_terms values are constants and known at compile-time for performance gain.
// Replace hiprand_uniform with hiprand_uniform(&states[id]) inside a loop to minimize state reads.
// Avoid recalculating the same index or expression multiple times, store it in a register, and reuse.
