```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring degrees_g is accessed sequentially and aligned to improve throughput.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during access to degrees.
// Use hiprand_init wisely to avoid redundant initializations across threads.
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_* for efficiency when performing reductions.
// Explore using native functions for exponentiation for potential performance improvement.
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized to decrease contention and serialization effects.
