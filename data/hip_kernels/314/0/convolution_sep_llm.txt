```
// Consider coalescing global memory access by rearranging data layout or order of operations.
// Use shared memory efficiently by loading data in a coalesced manner.
// Ensure boundary checks are minimal to reduce divergence.
// Utilize `__syncthreads()` correctly to ensure all threads have completed shared memory load.
// Consider padding shared memory for boundary conditions outside of logic.
// Reduce divergence by reorganizing conditional logic for setting ix, iy, iz.
