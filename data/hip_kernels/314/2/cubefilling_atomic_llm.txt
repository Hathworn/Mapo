// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize atomic operations by accumulating values in registers
// Evaluate occupancy and potentially adjust block size for better performance
// Profile memory bandwidth and optimize data transfer
