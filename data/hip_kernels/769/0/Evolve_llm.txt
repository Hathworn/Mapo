```
// Use shared memory to cache field data to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by using padding if needed
// Optimize memory coalescing for scores array by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Unroll the inner loops to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments if possible to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Consider using textures or read-only data cache for constant fields if available
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized to fully utilize the GPU
// Consider using warp-level primitives for score calculations to further enhance performance
