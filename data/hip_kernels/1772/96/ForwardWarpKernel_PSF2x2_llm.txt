```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning thread blocks with memory layout.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by aggregating updates in shared memory first.
// Evaluate whether using a texture memory would be beneficial for read-only data like `u` and `v`.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency of memory access.
// Ensure that load instructions are issued for continuous segments of global memory.
