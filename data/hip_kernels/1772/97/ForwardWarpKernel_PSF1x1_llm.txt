```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread blocks with memory layout.
// Consider reorganizing global memory accesses to minimize bank conflicts.
// Align thread blocks on thread-to-data prefetch to take advantage of memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and utilize data reuse.
// Where possible, prefetch data to reduce latency and increase parallel efficiency.
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize warp divergence.
// Minimize usage of atomic operations and consider alternatives for better performance.
