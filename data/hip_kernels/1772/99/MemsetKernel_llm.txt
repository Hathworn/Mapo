// Consider using shared memory for reducing global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing global memory reads and writes.
// Evaluate if memory bank conflicts are affecting shared memory performance.
// Use the __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to improve compiler optimization.
