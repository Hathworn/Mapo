// Use shared memory to optimize data access and reduce global memory transactions
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations
// Utilize vectorized loads/stores for better memory throughput
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing usage of local variables and avoiding unnecessary computations
// Consider using half precision if acceptable to further reduce memory bandwidth and increase arithmetic intensity
// Implement loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism within the kernel
