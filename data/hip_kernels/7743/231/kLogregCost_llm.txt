```
// Use shared memory to cache data locally to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for the loop iterating over numOut to minimize loop overhead.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads from global memory.
// Evaluate the usage of __syncthreads carefully to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
