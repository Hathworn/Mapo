```
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory access
// Ensure proper memory alignment to achieve higher memory bandwidth
// Use float2 or float4 if possible to enhance memory coalescing
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Minimize atomic operations by using warp-level primitives
