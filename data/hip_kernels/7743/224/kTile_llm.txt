```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in global memory.
// Investigate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency, particularly for frequently reused data.
// Examine the possibility of loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction throughput.
