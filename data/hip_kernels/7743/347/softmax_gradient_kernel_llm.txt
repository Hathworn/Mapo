```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access during reduction.
// Ensure full utilization of block dimensions for better parallelism.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory operations.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to minimize redundant global loads.
// Optimize memory coalescing when accessing global memory.
