```
// Ensure coalesced global memory access in loading A into shared memory
// Use vectorized loads (e.g., float4/int4) for A to reduce memory transactions
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts in s[]
// Prefetch data from A to shared memory for the next iteration to hide memory latency
// Align shared memory access patterns to WARP_SIZE for better performance
// Consider double buffering in s[] to overlap computation and memory operations
