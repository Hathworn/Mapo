// Ensure __restrict__ pointers to avoid pointer aliasing
// Minimize the stride loop overhead by using appropriate block and grid dimensions settings
// Use coalesced memory access pattern to maximize memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory for further potential performance improvements
