```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache 'p' values accessed frequently within threads
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'u', 'u_bar', and 'u_diff'
// Merge kernel calls if possible to reduce kernel launch overhead
// Leverage constant memory for read-only data like 'scalar_op' and 'f'
// Optimize thread block size for specific GPU architecture to maximize occupancy
// Align memory allocations to improve access speed on multi-dimensional arrays
// Avoid redundant computations within loops, such as recalculating 'i'
