```
// Consider removing any unnecessary synchronization barriers for performance
// Check if memory accesses are coalesced for potential optimization
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable for reducing overhead
// Analyze if warp divergence can be minimized
```
