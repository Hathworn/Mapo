```cpp
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage by aligning data for coalesced memory access.
// Ensure that TILE_SIZE is chosen to make full use of shared memory while minimizing bank conflicts.
// Analyze and minimize shared memory synchronization (__syncthreads()) within loops to reduce overhead.
// Consider loop unrolling inside the compute block to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure that A_elements and B_elements are aligned and padded appropriately for memory coalescing.
// Optimize register use to keep frequently accessed data close to compute units.
// Adjust memory access patterns to take advantage of spatial and temporal locality.
