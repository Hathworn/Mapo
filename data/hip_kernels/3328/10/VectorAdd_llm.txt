```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for VecA and VecB
// Minimize the use of shared memory by maximizing data reuse
// Ensure shared memory usage aligns with warp size for better efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization
// Evaluate if using shared memory provides a measurable performance gain
```
