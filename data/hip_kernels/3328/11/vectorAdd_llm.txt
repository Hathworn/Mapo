```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure shared memory usage is justified as it may add overhead
// Check if data reuse pattern justifies the use of shared memory
// Consider warp-level operations if possible for further optimization
// Evaluate optimal block size for better performance
// Make sure shared memory size does not exceed hardware limits
