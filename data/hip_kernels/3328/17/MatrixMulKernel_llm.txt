```
// Use shared memory for M and N matrices to optimize memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve performance
// Use multiple threads to load data into shared memory for better utilization
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
