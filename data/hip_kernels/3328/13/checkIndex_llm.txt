// Consider aligning data structures to ensure coalesced memory access
// Minimize global memory access by storing frequently used data in shared memory
// Utilize memory access patterns that maximize cache hit rates
// Limit usage of printf inside kernels for performance-efficient execution
// Ensure optimal block and grid size configuration to achieve maximum occupancy
