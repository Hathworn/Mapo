// Use efficient memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes.
// Implement shared memory usage where applicable to reduce global memory bottleneck.
// Minimize the use of conditionals for better branch prediction and warp efficiency.
// Optimize grid and block size configurations based on hardware specifications.
