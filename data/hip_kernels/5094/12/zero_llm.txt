```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access among threads
// Consider increasing tile dimensions for better occupancy
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data access when beneficial
// Implement double buffering technique to overlap memory operations with computations
