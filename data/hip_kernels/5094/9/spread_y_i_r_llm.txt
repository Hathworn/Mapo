```
// Consider using shared memory for tile-based data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory alignment to enhance coalesced access to global memory
// Optimize memory access patterns to utilize warp-level primitives for better performance
// Review grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and reduce limits on resource usage
