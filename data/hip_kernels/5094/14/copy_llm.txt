// Use memory coalescing by ensuring aligned access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Analyze thread occupancy and adjust TILE_DIM for optimal utilization.
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures to improve access efficiency.
// Check for possible bank conflicts in shared memory and resolve if identified.
// Use memory fences to ensure proper synchronization of memory accesses.
