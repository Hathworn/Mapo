```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access in both x and y directions.
// Looking into vectorized data types to load and store multiple particles can significantly reduce memory access time.
// Consider reducing pitch to facilitate more aligned memory access if not affecting other accesses.
// If possible, ensure stride_x and stride_y maximize the use of shared memory within a warp.
// Unroll for loops further if shared memory allows it to increase throughput.
