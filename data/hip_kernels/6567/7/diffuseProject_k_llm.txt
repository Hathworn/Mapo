```
// Unroll loops to enhance performance by allowing the compiler to optimize iterations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Adjust shared memory size based on block dimensions for optimal usage
// Load data into shared memory before processing to minimize latency
// Ensure data persistence and correct ordering when writing results back to global memory
```
