```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider converting division operations into multiplication with reciprocal for efficiency
// Minimize shared memory allocation size by using real-time calculations
// Test using atomic operations to simplify and optimize reduction further
// Align data access pattern to maximize memory coalescing
