// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better performance
// Optimize reduction steps to minimize synchronization overhead
// Ensure alignment in memory accesses for optimal throughput
// Use fewer threads for reduction to decrease computation latency
