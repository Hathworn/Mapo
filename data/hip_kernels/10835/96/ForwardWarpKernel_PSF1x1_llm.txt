```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for src and dst arrays.
// Minimize global memory transactions by using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce latency when accessing global memory.
// Ensure that memory access is aligned to improve memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for read-only memory to utilize texture cache.
