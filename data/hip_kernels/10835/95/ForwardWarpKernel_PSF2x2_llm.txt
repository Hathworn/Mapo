```
// Consider coalesced access patterns by ensuring that threads read contiguous memory locations to enhance memory throughput.
// Minimize bank conflicts by adjusting how data is accessed within shared memory, aiming for aligned access.
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to reduce the overhead of loop control and increase instruction throughput.
// Utilize __restrict__ qualifier to indicate that pointers do not alias, allowing better optimization by the compiler.
// Prefetch data to shared memory before processing to reduce global memory latency, if applicable within resource constraints.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for potentially better caching behavior when accessing u and v arrays.
