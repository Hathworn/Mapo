```cpp
// Consider using __shared__ memory for frequently accessed shared variables to reduce global memory access latency.
// Attempt memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory addresses for gradOutput_data.
// Pre-compute scale_factor multiplications outside of loops to reduce redundant calculations.
