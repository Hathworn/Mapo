```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better memory efficiency
// Align memory access patterns with warp boundaries
// Minimize shared memory usage to enhance occupancy
// Reduce divergent branching to improve performance
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers
// Utilize loop unrolling techniques to enhance throughput
// Evaluate the impact of increased block size on performance
// Implement asynchronous memory prefetching if applicable
// Analyze bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
