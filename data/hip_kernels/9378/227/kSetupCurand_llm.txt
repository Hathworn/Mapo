```
// Consider using shared memory to store temporary results to reduce global memory access
// Check if coalesced memory access patterns can be achieved for better performance
// Ensure memory access is aligned to maximize read/write efficiency
// Assess if the kernel launch configuration (block and grid size) is optimal for the hardware
// Investigate if kernel fusion with other operations could further reduce global memory traffic
