// Use fast conversion for integer operations to speed up execution.
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated data accesses such as maxProbs and probs.
// Use pointers for faster memory access when iterating to reduce overhead.
// Optimize calculation by reducing divergence, using conditional statements efficiently.
// Consider reducing memory footprint by using float instead of double, where applicable.
