```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider using a more efficient block-wide reduction technique.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Use fewer synchronizations (__syncthreads()) if possible to improve performance.
// Optimize the reduction step with thread coarsening techniques.
