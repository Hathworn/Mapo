```cpp
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for improved memory throughput
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated operations to improve performance
```
