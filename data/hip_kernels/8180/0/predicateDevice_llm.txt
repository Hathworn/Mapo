```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to help the compiler with memory aliasing
// Use shared memory to cache data if the function is bottlenecked by global memory bandwidth
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_sync() for optimized reductions
// Ensure data is coalesced for better global memory access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches even in conditional logic
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for repetitive calculations
// Evaluate if using fewer threads with increased workload per thread is more efficient
