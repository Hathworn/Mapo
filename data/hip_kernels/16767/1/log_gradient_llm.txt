```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase data reuse within blocks
// Align memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads/writes
// Optimize shared memory usage for synchronization and minimize idle threads
// Consider warp-level reductions to improve efficiency and reduce synchronization overhead
