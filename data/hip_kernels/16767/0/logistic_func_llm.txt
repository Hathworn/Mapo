```
// Utilize shared memory to cache betas and minimize repeated global memory accesses
// Synchronize threads after loading shared memory to ensure safe and consistent data access
// Check row_index bounds to avoid excess computation and potential out-of-bound access
// Optimize data access pattern to minimize strided memory access which can slow down performance
