// Optimize memory access by minimizing redundant calculations.
// Use more shared memory to improve data locality.
// Reduce atomic operations by accumulating results in local variables.
// Pre-calculate scaled dimensions and re-use them to reduce computational overhead.
// Align memory accesses with warp boundaries for improved coalescing.
// Consider using occupancy calculator to determine optimal block size and grid size.
