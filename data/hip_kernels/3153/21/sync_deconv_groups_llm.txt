```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use constant memory for any read-only data that is accessed by all threads.
// Align data structures to ensure coalesced accesses.
// Employ loop unrolling where beneficial for performance.
// Avoid branching within the kernel to maintain warp execution efficiency.
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for efficiency.
// Profile your application to identify bottlenecks and address them.
