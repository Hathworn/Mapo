```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing and reduce bank conflicts.
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data for faster access.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to reduce serialization.
// Utilize registers efficiently to store intermediate computations.
// Consider loop unrolling for improved execution throughput.
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency.
