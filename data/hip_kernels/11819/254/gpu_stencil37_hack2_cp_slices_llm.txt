// Consider optimizing memory coalescing by aligning the shared_slices index calculation with warp boundaries.
// Ensure that shared memory access patterns minimize bank conflicts for improved performance.
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores to reduce memory transaction costs.
// Consider unrolling loops where applicable to minimize loop overhead and possibly improve memory access patterns.
