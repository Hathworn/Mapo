```c
// Precompute indices to reduce redundant calculations within loop
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning threads with memory layout
// Assess implementational benefits of unrolling loops
// Align memory accesses to avoid misaligned data transfers
// Consider using read-only data cache for constant data
// Balance the load among threads to improve memory throughput
