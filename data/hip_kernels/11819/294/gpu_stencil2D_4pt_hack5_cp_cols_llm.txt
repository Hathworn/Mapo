```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures accordingly
// Use shared memory to avoid global memory latency for frequently accessed data
// Reduce redundant calculations by computing bounds outside of loops
// Implement conditional loading to prevent unnecessary global memory access
// Synchronize threads after data loading to ensure all threads have updated memory data
// Minimize use of printf statements in production code to reduce overhead
