```
// Consider optimizing tile size to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Check for optimal block and thread dimensions based on GPU architecture
// Use loop unrolling for the inner tile load and stencil operations if applicable
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by verifying index calculations
// Explore memory padding to align with GPU memory access patterns
