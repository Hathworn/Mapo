// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Ensure the kernel is using appropriate indexing to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning memory accesses across threads.
