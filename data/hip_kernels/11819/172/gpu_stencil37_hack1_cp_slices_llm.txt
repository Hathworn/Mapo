```cpp
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier on pointers to optimize memory access.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure memory coalescing to minimize global memory access time.
// Utilize loop unrolling to improve performance.
// Prefetch data where possible to hide memory latency.
// Employ warp-level synchronization to reduce redundant synchronization barriers.
