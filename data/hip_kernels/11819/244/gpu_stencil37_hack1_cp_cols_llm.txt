```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by aligning shared_cols accesses with warp size.
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently utilized to minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared_cols.
// Use memory prefetching techniques if necessary to overlap data transfer and computation.
// Avoid excessive synchronization unless necessary to reduce warp divergence.
// Evaluate leveraging constant memory for frequently accessed variables like tile_x, tile_y, tile_z.
