```cpp
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory reads and writes.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory accesses.
// Minimize arithmetic operations in the loop to enhance performance.
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions.
// Consider using vectorized memory operations if applicable.
// Explore prefetching data to shared memory for improved latency.
// Align data structures to facilitate coalesced memory transactions.
