```
// Optimize global memory access pattern by coalescing reads to dst.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure alignment of global memory accesses to achieve peak bandwidth.
// Consider loading more elements per thread if shared memory allows.
// Reduce divergence in legalNextRow and legalCurCol checks.
// Verify if shared memory usage is within limits for larger grids.
