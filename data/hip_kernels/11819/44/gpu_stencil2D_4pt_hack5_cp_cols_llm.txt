```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when loading data into shared_cols
// Minimize memory transactions by using calculated row_offset once
// Ensure __syncthreads() is called to synchronize threads after memory loading
// Use efficient indexing to reduce redundant calculations and improve access patterns
// Consider prefetching data to better hide memory latency
