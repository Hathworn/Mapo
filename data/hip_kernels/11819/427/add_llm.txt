```cpp
// Consider coalesced global memory access patterns for better performance.
// Assess shared memory bank conflicts and adjust memory structure if needed.
// Prefetch data to reduce global memory latencies.
// Ensure memory operations are well-aligned to avoid misaligned memory accesses.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier if no pointer aliasing occurs to guide compiler optimizations.
