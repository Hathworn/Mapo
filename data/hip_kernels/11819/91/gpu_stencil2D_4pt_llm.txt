```
// Unroll the loops for better performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Coalesce memory access in global memory by accessing consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency.
// Synchronize threads after loading into shared memory to prevent race conditions.
// Balance workload among threads by ensuring each thread does equal amount of work.
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp efficiency.
