```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve cache locality
// Prefetch halo regions into shared memory to eliminate redundant global memory accesses
// Compute loop bounds outside loops to reduce redundant calculations inside loops
// Use `__syncthreads()` to ensure all threads have loaded their portion into shared memory before use
// Consider adjusting TILE_SIZE based on different GPUs' shared memory capacity and compute capabilities
