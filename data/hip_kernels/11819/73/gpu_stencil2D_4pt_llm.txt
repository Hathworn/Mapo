```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Copy data to shared memory to improve memory access efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize thread access to shared memory
// Use individual threads to handle separate memory regions for parallelism
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to optimize tile size for memory access
// Minimize redundant memory accesses by using shared memory effectively
// Ensure halos are copied correctly to reduce boundary condition overhead
// Optimize loop execution by unrolling loops where feasible
