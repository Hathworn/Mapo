```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to shared memory for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Reduce redundant boundary checks by consolidating them in the loop conditions
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access and improve performance
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory
