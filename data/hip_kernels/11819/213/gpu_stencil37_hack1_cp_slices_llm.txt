// Consider using shared memory for columns as well for faster access.
// Use vectorized loads/stores where possible to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for dst and shared_slices to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Avoid excessive syncthreads calls; ensure minimum synchronization for better performance.
