```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate the need for atomic operations to prevent race conditions in shared memory
// Optimize memory access to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory
// Use __restrict__ pointers to potentially enable better compiler optimizations
