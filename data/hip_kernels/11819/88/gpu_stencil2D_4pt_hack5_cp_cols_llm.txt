```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning contiguous threads with contiguous memory.
// Avoid thread divergence by checking boundary conditions before accessing memory.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads complete writing to shared memory before proceeding.
// Opt for memory access patterns that allow for maximum efficiency in global memory transactions.
