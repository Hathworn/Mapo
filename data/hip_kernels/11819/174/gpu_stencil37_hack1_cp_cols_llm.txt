```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing for better bandwidth utilization
// Use loop unrolling further if tile_z is large and beneficial
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Explore reducing synchronization barriers by restructuring logic
