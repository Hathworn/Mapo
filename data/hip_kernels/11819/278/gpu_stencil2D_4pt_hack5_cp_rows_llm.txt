```
// Consider optimizing global memory access patterns for dst array.
// Evaluate the potential for using shared memory more effectively.
// Check if further coalescing of memory accesses can be achieved.
// Investigate potential warp-level memory optimizations.
// Assess the impact of loop unrolling or other ILP techniques.
// Verify if the CUDA block size and grid configuration are optimal.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers for potential optimizations.
// Identify opportunities for reducing redundant computations within the kernel.
