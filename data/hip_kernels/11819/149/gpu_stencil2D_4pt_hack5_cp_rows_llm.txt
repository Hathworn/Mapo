```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for better performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by all threads in a warp to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize memory bank conflicts in shared memory to enhance performance.
// Leverage __syncthreads() to synchronize threads effectively after updating shared memory.
