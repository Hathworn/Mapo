// Consider using more efficient memory access patterns, such as coalescing
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations in index calculations
// Ensure optimal use of shared memory and register usage
// Adjust tile size to optimize shared memory utilization
// Potentially increase block size for better memory transaction efficiency
