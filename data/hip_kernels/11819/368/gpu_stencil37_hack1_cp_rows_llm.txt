```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loops to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Minimize conditional statements inside the loop to improve performance
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory operations
// Consider using additional prefetching strategies to hide memory latency
