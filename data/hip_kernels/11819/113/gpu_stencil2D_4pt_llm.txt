```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by aligning global memory reads.
// Minimize the use of magic numbers by defining constants for indices.
// Potentially unroll loops for TILE_SIZE to enhance performance.
// Avoid redundant synchronization where possible to reduce overhead.
// Consider using halo overlap optimization to minimize edge data redundancy.
