```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access by storing halo regions
// Coalesce global memory access by arranging threads to access contiguous memory locations
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed shared memory operations before proceeding
// Transfer data in chunks that fit in the shared memory to improve memory throughput
// Consider using double buffering for shared memory to hide memory latency during stencil operations
// Load and store data in a way that avoids bank conflicts in shared memory if possible
