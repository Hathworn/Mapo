```
// Use registers to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning accesses in consecutive threads
// Minimize shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts
// Align shared memory access to improve efficiency
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure memory consistency between threads
