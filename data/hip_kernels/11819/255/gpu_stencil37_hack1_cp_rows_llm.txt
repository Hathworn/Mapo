```
// Merge conditions to minimize thread divergence
// Calculate base indices once to reduce redundant calculations
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for faster access
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced by aligning the accesses of adjacent threads
// Synchronize threads at the end of memory operations to ensure data consistency
