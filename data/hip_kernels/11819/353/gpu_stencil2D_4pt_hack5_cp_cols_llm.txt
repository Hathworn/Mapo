```
//Minimize global memory access by caching frequently used data in shared memory.
//Use __syncthreads() to ensure the correct timing for reading shared memory.
//Avoid recalculating indices inside loops or conditional branches to reduce computational overhead.
//Align memory access patterns to coalesced accesses for better performance.
//Consider using memory prefetching techniques for better data load performance.
