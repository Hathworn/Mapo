```
// Avoid unnecessary global memory accesses by using shared memory effectively.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to maximize throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling if tile_z is small to reduce loop control overhead.
// Check if shared memory usage affects occupancy; optimize block and grid sizes accordingly.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
