```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning shared memory data structure to warp-size boundaries.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access, especially for col data.
// Examine using texture memory or read-only data cache for optimal row/column data reuse.
// Review whether padding shared memory could eliminate bank conflicts for parallel threads.
// Use `__ldg` for read-only global memory access for potentially better caching and coalescing.
