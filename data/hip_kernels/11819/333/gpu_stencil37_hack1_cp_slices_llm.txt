```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement loop unrolling to improve execution efficiency.
// Check data boundaries to prevent out-of-bounds memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing for better performance.
// Consider using atomic operations if needed to avoid read/write conflicts.
// Optimize memory access patterns for better cache utilization.
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory transactions.
