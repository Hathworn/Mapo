```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses in stencil computation.
// Coalesced memory access for efficient global memory reads into shared memory.
// Each thread block loads a tile of the input matrix, including a halo border, into shared memory.
// Prevent bank conflicts by ensuring memory indices in shared memory align with warp boundaries.
// Synchronize threads before stencil computation to ensure all data is loaded into shared memory.
// Use a single thread to load halo regions to reduce redundant operations.
// Ensure synchronization after loading halos to maintain data consistency.
