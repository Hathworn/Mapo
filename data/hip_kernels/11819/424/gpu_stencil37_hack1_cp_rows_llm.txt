```
// Precompute index offsets to minimize repeat calculations
// Cache frequently accessed variables in registers
// Use loops to reduce redundant computations and memory operations
// Check boundary conditions before accessing global memory to avoid out-of-bounds errors
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory access efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after critical memory operations
