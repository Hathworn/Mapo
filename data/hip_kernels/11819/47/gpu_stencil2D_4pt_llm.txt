```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for stencil computations
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning data access patterns
// Ensure proper memory alignment to enhance access efficiency
// Minimize synchronization by computing halos within a single thread
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to ensure correct results without unnecessary barriers
// Balance compute and memory operations to achieve optimal performance
// Aim for maximum occupancy by choosing appropriate block size and TILE_SIZE
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by aligning data appropriately
// Explore using read-only cache for potentially repeated data access
