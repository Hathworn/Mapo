```
// Align memory accesses to coalesce global memory transactions.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Minimize thread divergence by improving condition checks.
// Apply double buffering in shared memory to hide global memory latency.
// Evaluate memory read/write patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Ensure proper thread synchronization to avoid race conditions.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and resource utilization.
