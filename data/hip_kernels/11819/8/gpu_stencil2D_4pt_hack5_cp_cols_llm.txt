```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory wisely and ensure threads access contiguous memory segments.
// Minimize divergent branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is placed correctly to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Ensure that memory access patterns are optimal and avoid uncoalesced accesses.
