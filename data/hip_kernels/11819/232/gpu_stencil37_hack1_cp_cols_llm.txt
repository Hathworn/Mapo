```cpp
// Consider using memory coalescing to optimize global memory access
// Check for any possible bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Evaluate if splitting the loop can help with better memory access patterns
// Assess whether loop unrolling could improve performance by reducing control instructions
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is necessary to avoid unnecessary synchronization
