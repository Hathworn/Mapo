```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for loading data into shared memory.
// Implement padding to address different banks of shared memory and prevent bank conflicts.
// Use vectorized loading with float4 or similar types to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that memory access is aligned to 128-byte boundaries where possible for better performance.
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy given the shared memory usage constraints.
