```
// Use shared memory efficiently to avoid redundant global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by loading data in contiguous blocks
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing padding and boundary checks
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory
// Ensure all global memory accesses are aligned for better performance
