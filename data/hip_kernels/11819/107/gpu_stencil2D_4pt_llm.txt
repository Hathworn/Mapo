```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses during stencil computation.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by organizing global and shared memory indices.
// The use of shared memory reduces redundant memory fetching for neighboring values.
// Remember to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access through optimal alignment.
// Adjust block and tile dimensions to maximize memory throughput and minimize idle threads.
// Consider double buffering for shared memory to improve computational efficiency.
