```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that all threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations in global memory.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts when writing and reading.
// Try to overlap data fetching into shared memory with computations to hide memory latency.
// Use appropriate synchronization to ensure all threads have the correct shared memory data.
