```
// Consider using shared memory to store temporary results for better memory access pattern
// Try coalescing global memory accesses by accessing consecutive elements in a warp
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring conditionals are warp-uniform
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries for better performance
// Use the __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments to optimize memory access if applicable
// Profile the kernel to identify memory bottlenecks and improve data flow
