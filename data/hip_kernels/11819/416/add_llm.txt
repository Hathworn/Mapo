// Use coalesced memory access to optimize global memory reads and writes.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts to ensure efficient memory access.
// Replace redundant reads/writes with registers wherever possible.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead when applicable.
// Double-check shared memory allocation size to match the kernel's requirements.
// Consider fusing operations to reduce memory transactions.
