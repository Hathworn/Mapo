```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access within threads.
// Leverage __syncthreads() effectively to ensure data consistency.
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory throughput.
// Consider splitting the kernel into smaller tasks if warp occupancy is low.
// Explore using vectorized operations to reduce instruction count.
// Ensure loop unrolling where applicable to minimize loop overhead.
// Verify that all memory accesses are within bounds and optimize conditional checks.
// Consider using memory prefetching techniques to improve data availability.
