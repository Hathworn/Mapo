// Consider combining memory accesses into fewer operations to improve coalescing 
// Minimize the use of conditional checks in the main memory access to enhance speed
// Analyze the memory access patterns for potential use of texture memory to optimize read operations 
// Use shared memory effectively by ensuring its limited usage and avoiding bank conflicts
