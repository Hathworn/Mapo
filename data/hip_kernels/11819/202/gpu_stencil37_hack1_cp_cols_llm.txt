```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning threads' access to consecutive memory locations in global memory
// Minimize redundant calculations by precomputing index values outside loops when possible
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency
// Synchronize threads using __syncthreads to ensure all memory operations are completed before iteration
// Consider increasing tile sizes if shared memory capacity allows, to improve memory access efficiency
