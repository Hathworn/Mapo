```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory more efficiently to reduce redundant access to global memory.
// Evaluate utilizing loop unrolling for `tz` loop to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Optimize index calculations by precomputing repetitive expressions outside the loop.
// Reduce the number of `__syncthreads()` calls, as they introduce synchronization overhead.
