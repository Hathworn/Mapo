```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning shared memory copies.
// Use __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions when writing to shared memory.
// Combine conditions to reduce conditional checks and improve pipeline utilization.
// Consider using double buffering for 'shared_rows' to hide memory latency.
// Check if loop unrolling can benefit performance for 'tz' loop.
