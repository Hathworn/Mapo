```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize shared memory loading to improve coalescing
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to reduce overhead
// Avoid branch divergence in halo handling
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for better performance
// Consider loop unrolling for TILE_SIZE loops if applicable
