```
// Consider using shared memory more efficiently to reduce redundant loading.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses, ensure accesses are coalesced.
// Minimize global memory accesses by caching frequently accessed data in registers.
// Reduce unnecessary synchronization to improve parallel efficiency.
// Ensure the use of aligned memory accesses to maximize bandwidth.
