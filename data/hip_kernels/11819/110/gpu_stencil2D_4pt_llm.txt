// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Try to maximize the tile size to leverage shared memory capacity.
// Consider using warp-level parallelism for better efficiency in halo processing.
