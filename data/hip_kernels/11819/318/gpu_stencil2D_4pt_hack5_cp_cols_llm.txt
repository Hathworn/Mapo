```
// Consider using shared memory for repeated data access to reduce global memory fetches.
// Optimize thread block dimensions to maximize memory coalescing.
// Ensure synchronization barriers are strategically placed after all required shared memory writes.
// Minimize divergence in control flow to improve memory latency hiding.
// Evaluate prefetching data into shared memory before compute operations.
