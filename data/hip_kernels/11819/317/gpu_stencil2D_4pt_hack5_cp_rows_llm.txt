```
// Avoid redundant memory access by ensuring all threads within a block cooperate to load data.
// Utilize shared memory to prefetch data from global memory to reduce access latency.
// Align shared memory access patterns to the warp size to maximize memory throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for efficient use of memory bandwidth.
