// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for shared_rows to improve coalescing.
// Explore double buffering techniques to minimize wait time on __syncthreads().
// Investigate increasing tile_y for better memory throughput and reduced divergence.
// Assess the potential benefit of using texture memory for read-only data like dst.
