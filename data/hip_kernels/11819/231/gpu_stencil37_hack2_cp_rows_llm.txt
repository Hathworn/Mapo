// Use coalesced memory access patterns for `dst` to improve global memory throughput.
// Ensure `shared_rows` alignment with `shared memory bank` to avoid bank conflicts.
// Prefetch data into shared memory outside the critical path to reduce latency.
// Optimize the use of shared memory by minimizing redundant data storage.
// Reduce shared memory read usage by reusing values loaded in registers wherever possible.
// Consider increasing `blockDim.x` as long as shared memory limits allow for better occupancy.
// Use compile-time constants instead of variables within oft-executed code when possible.
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() calls if no thread communication occurs.
