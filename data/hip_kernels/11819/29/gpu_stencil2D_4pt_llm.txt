```cpp
// Use __restrict__ keyword for src and dst pointers to aid compiler optimizations.
// Align shared memory accesses by using a stride to eliminate bank conflicts.
// Consider adjusting TILE_SIZE to maximize occupancy based on register usage.
// Ensure that the amount of shared memory declared does not exceed device limits.
// Use cooperative groups and grid-stride loops for potential parallelization improvements.
// Analyze and optimize boundary conditions separately to improve overall performance.
// Apply loop unrolling where applicable to improve computational efficiency.
