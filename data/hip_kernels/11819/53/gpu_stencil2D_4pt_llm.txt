// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning shared memory indices with global memory
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant global memory loads in stencil computation
// Evaluate if shared memory bank conflicts occur and optimize indexing to reduce them
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data to potentially improve performance
// Consider reducing HALO copying operations by optimizing thread synchronization strategies
