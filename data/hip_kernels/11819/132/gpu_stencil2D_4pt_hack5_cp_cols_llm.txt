```
// Combine conditionals to reduce warp divergence and unnecessary if-statements
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Avoid atomic operations in shared memory if not necessary
// Reuse data in shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize thread synchronization to optimize performance
