```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses during stencil computation.
// Copy data from global memory to shared memory in smaller chunks to improve coalescence.
// Align global memory accesses by ensuring that data is copied in a pattern that reduces warp divergence.
// Ensure the computation using shared memory is optimized to avoid frequent global memory access.
// Use shared memory to store neighbor values and reduce redundant calculations.
// Increase shared memory dimensions appropriately to accommodate halos efficiently.
// Perform halo exchanges efficiently to limit the synchronization overhead.
// Ensure that data loading and computation are balanced to maximize GPU utilization.
// Minimize thread divergence by allowing boundary checks to be centrally managed.
