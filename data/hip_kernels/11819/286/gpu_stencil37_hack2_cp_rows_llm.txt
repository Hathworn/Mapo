```cpp
// Optimize memory accesses by coalescing global memory loads to ensure maximum bandwidth efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce memory latency.
// Minimize the usage of conditional statements inside loops to prevent divergent threads.
// Align data structures in memory to ensure efficient memory transactions.
