```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider optimizing for coalesced memory access to improve throughput
// Reduce shared memory usage if possible to allow more parallel blocks
// Unroll loops to decrease instruction overhead and increase parallel execution
// Utilize read-only cache for constant values to reduce memory bandwidth usage
