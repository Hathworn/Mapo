```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalesced memory access for shared_cols for improved performance.
// Ensure loop unrolling to leverage increased instruction-level parallelism.
// Align memory access patterns to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Use `__syncthreads()` cautiously to synchronize threads efficiently.
