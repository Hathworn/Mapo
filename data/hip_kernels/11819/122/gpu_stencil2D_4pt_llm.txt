```
// Consider coalesced memory access for global memory reads and writes to improve access efficiency
// Employ shared memory more extensively to reduce global memory access latency
// Use appropriate thread block size to enable maximum occupancy and balance between computation and memory usage
// Optimize halo region copying to minimize synchronization overhead
// Consider loop unrolling for stencil computation to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Align data structures to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Utilize __ldg() function to load read-only data, if applicable, for potential caching benefits
