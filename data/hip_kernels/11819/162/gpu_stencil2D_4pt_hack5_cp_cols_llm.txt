// Avoid redundant global memory access by loading values into shared memory.
// Minimize shared memory usage by handling boundary conditions cleanly.
// Use a single conditional statement for checking legal row and column boundaries.
// Ensure that data is loaded and utilized efficiently across the entire warp.
// Balance shared memory and register usage for optimal performance.
