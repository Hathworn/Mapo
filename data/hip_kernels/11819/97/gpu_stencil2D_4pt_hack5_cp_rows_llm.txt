```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads read contiguous memory locations.
// Leverage shared memory for tiles to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency.
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Maximize occupancy by adjusting block and grid dimensions.
// Avoid divergence by keeping branch conditions uniform across warps.
