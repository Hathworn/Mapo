```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Use conditional statements to avoid unnecessary memory operations and reduce divergence
// Synchronize threads after loading data to shared memory to ensure data consistency
// Aim to coalesce global memory accesses for better efficiency
// Avoid branching inside loops to minimize warp divergence
