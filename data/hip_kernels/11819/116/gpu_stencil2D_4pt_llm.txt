```
// Consider optimizing global memory access by coalescing loads for better performance
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory traffic and improve data reuse
// Load shared memory efficiently by using multiple threads to preload data into shared memory
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Use conditional loading for edge handling instead of branch divergence
// Synchronize threads carefully to ensure data dependence correctness across block boundaries
// Reduce the arithmetic intensity by simplifying the operations inside the inner loops
