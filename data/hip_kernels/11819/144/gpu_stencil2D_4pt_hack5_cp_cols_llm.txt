```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to facilitate coalescing.
// Optimize index calculations to minimize arithmetic operations.
// Minimize synchronization where possible to reduce overhead.
// Use vectorized loads/stores if supported by hardware to increase bandwidth.
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by balancing resource usage and block configuration.
