```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses in stencil computation
// Consider using memory coalescing techniques for better global memory access patterns
// Load halo regions into shared memory once to reduce redundant memory operations
// Ensure that shared memory loads and computation follow after synchronization points
// Favor inline computation of indices to reduce overhead in loop iterations
// Opt for using warp-level primitives where applicable to improve synchronization and reduce latency
