// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory more efficiently to minimize global memory access.
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Optimize the use of registers to decrease register spilling.
// Assess thread block size for better occupancy and performance balance.
