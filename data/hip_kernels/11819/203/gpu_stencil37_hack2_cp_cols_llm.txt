```c++
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Try to minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce the number of global memory transactions.
// Ensure the shared memory bank conflicts are minimized by properly aligning data.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to synchronize threads only when necessary.
// Take advantage of constant memory for frequently accessed read-only variables.
