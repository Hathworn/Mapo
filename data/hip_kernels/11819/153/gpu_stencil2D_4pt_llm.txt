```
// Use coalesced memory accesses when loading data from global to shared memory
// Ensure SHMEM accesses are bank conflict-free
// Balance thread workload to avoid divergence
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider loop-unrolling for the stencil computation if TILE_SIZE is known at compile-time
// Optimize shared memory usage to fit within hardware limitations
// Use constant memory for any invariant coefficients used in computation
