```cpp
// Consolidate adjacent memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Avoid repeated recalculations of indices to save computation
// Combine multiple condition checks to reduce branching
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed values and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() before and after shared memory usage
// Consider reducing the scope of thread divergence within the warp
// Ensure that memory alignment is optimized for better access patterns
