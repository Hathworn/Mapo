```
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize coalesced memory accesses for global memory reads and writes
// Apply loop unrolling to further enhance performance in the loop structures
// Minimize branch divergence in thread execution paths
// Ensure proper synchronization after writing to shared memory
// Utilize compiler optimization pragmas where applicable
// Investigate optimal block size and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy
