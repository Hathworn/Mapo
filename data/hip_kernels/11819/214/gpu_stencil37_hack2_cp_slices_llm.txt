```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures correctly
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize usage of __syncthreads() to minimize performance bottlenecks
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for the tile loop to improve throughput
// Make use of shared memory efficiently by loading data in chunks
