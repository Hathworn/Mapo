```cpp
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning global memory accesses
// Consider double buffering to hide latency when loading shared memory
// Ensure TILE_SIZE maintains performance across various GPU architectures
// Reduce __syncthreads() calls by reorganizing computation to minimize thread divergence
// Unroll the loops if TILE_SIZE is a compile-time constant for better ILP
// Experiment with varying values of TILE_SIZE for optimal occupancy
// Investigate using a custom memory allocator for shared memory to prevent bank conflicts
