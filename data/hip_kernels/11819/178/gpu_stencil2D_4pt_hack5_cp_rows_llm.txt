```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for shared_rows[] to improve memory efficiency.
// Minimize branch divergence by optimizing conditional checks.
// Try using shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for the critical computation sections.
