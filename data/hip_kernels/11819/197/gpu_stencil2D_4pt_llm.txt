```
// Consolidate multiple memory reads into fewer transactions by utilizing shared memory
// Ensure aligned memory access for global memory reads to improve coalescing
// Minimize divergence in thread execution to enhance warp efficiency
// Use loop unrolling techniques where possible to reduce the overhead of loop control
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to effectively utilize the GPU's SMs
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by carefully structuring data layout
