```
// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency.
// Re-organize the loops to prevent bank conflicts within the shared memory.
// Optimize thread hierarchy to match data access patterns for performance improvement.
// Minimize synchronization calls by grouping memory operations where possible.
