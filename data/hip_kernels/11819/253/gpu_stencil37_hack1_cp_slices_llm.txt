```
// Consider using shared memory more efficiently to reduce global memory loads.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop control overhead and enhance register usage.
// Combine condition checks to reduce unnecessary branching and improve warp execution.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts to maximize data throughput.
