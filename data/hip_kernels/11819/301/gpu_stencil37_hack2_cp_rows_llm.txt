```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to dst for better global memory performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Pre-calculate as much as possible outside loops to decrease computation inside loops.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve fetching efficiency.
// Implement double buffering to overlap memory operations with computation for improved performance.
// Reduce branching where possible to maintain consistent execution across threads.
