```
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced memory accesses.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after updating shared memory.
// Ensure that all threads have completed writing to shared memory before computation.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage for better performance.
// Use conditional checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
