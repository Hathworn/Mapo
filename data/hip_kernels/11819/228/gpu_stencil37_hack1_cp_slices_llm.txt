```
// Prefetch data to shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses by aligning thread data accesses.
// Use shared memory to share data within a block and reduce redundant memory access.
// Apply loop unrolling for the inner loop to enhance performance through instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure boundary check conditions are placed outside of loops for efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory operations to avoid data hazards.
