```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Calculate indices only once to improve performance
// Optimize the loop by using increment to enhance locality
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads() after shared memory updates
// Check bounds to avoid illegal memory accesses
```
