```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for global memory loads and stores.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring a stride that avoids overlapping bank indices.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loops to help with instruction-level parallelism.
// Avoid unnecessary shared memory synchronization, optimize the usage of __syncthreads().
