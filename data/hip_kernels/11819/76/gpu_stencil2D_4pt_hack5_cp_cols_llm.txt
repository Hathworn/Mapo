```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for dst array
// Ensure shared memory usage is aligned to warp size for optimal access
// Use double buffering to hide memory latency and increase bandwidth utilization
// Minimize global memory access latency by using shared memory effectively
// Align data structures to avoid misaligned accesses and maximize throughput
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization barriers to reduce delay
// Evaluate the possibility of using texture memory for read-only data access
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput
