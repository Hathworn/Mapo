```
// Optimize: Minimize global memory accesses by leveraging shared memory.
// Optimize: Ensure coalesced access patterns by aligning global memory access with warp boundaries.
// Optimize: Use __syncthreads() efficiently to prevent unnecessary synchronization.
// Optimize: Look into loop unrolling for repetitive memory access operations within the kernel.
// Optimize: Reduce register usage by inspecting compiler optimization reports.
