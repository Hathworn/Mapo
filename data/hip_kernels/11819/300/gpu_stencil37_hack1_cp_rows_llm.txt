```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads and writes.
// Using shared memory optimizes access times; ensure shared memory size is adequate but not excessive.
// Use loop unrolling techniques to optimize performance further.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used appropriately to synchronize threads after shared memory usage.
// Validate memory bounds to prevent out-of-bounds accesses and potential undefined behavior.
