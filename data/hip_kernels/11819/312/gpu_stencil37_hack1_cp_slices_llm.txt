```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Assess tiling parameters tile_x, tile_y, and tile_z for better cache utilization.
// Ensure thread blocks are sized to the maximum occupancy to improve throughput.
// Leverage loop unrolling in the loops for better performance.
// Minimize branch divergence in conditional statements for warp efficiency.
// Utilize asynchrony where possible to hide memory latency.
