```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data within shared memory.
// Optimize memory access by merging legality checks to minimize branch divergence.
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses for better performance.
// Consider manual loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure that the memory transactions make full use of the 32, 64, or 128-byte memory transactions.
// Evaluate the use of a newer compiler or different optimization flags for better auto-vectorization.
