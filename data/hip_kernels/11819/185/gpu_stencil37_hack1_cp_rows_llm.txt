```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to potentially enhance compiler optimization.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Apply loop unrolling further, if appropriate, to increase utilization.
// Examine and possibly optimize index calculation to minimize arithmetic operations.
// Avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory may improve shared memory access speed.
// Assess if applying constant memory could speed up repeated accesses.
