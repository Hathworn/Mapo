```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory access patterns avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate using a larger TILE_SIZE for better load balancing and fewer kernel launches.
// Prefetch boundary halo regions into registers where possible to reduce shared memory pressure.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to minimize performance overhead.
