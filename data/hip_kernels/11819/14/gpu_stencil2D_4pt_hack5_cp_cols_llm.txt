```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory access latency and increase bandwidth
// Avoid warp divergence by keeping conditional statements consistent across warp lanes
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve execution time
