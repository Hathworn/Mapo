```cpp
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring continuous memory pattern
// Consider minimizing shared memory usage unless performance gains are significant
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Investigate if memory alignment can further optimize global memory access
// Explore potential for occupancy improvement by adjusting block size
