```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize redundant calculations for thread indices.
// Ensure optimal shared memory dimensions to prevent boundary conditions.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Load data into shared memory in coalesced manner.
// Balance the memory access between global and shared memory efficiently.
// Ensure alignment of memory access for efficient loading.
