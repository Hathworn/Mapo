```cpp
// Consider coalesced global memory access for dst and shared_cols
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute similar instructions
// Prefetch data into shared memory if data reuse is high
// Ensure synchronous data copy with __syncthreads()
```
