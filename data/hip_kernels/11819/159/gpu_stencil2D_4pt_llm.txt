```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize memory transactions by coalescing global loads
// Organize threads to ensure memory alignment
// Maximize occupancy by adjusting TILE_SIZE and blockDim
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory
// Prefetch data into shared memory for faster access
