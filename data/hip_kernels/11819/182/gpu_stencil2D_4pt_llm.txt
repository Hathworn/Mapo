```
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance memory coalescing in shared memory copy operations.
// Use specific threads to load halo regions to reduce redundant memory operations.
// Reduce index calculations by using constant expressions where possible.
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize read/write throughput.
