```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory addresses.
// Ensure memory alignment for global memory accesses to improve performance.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses within the kernel.
// Ensure shared memory access patterns minimize bank conflicts.
// Opt for fewer __syncthreads() calls, only when necessary for synchronizing thread progress.
