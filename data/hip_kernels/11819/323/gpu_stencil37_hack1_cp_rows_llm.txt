```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use `__syncthreads()` to synchronize threads after writing to shared memory.
// Consider increasing thread block size or tile size for better occupancy.
// Avoid duplicate memory access by storing reused data in registers.
