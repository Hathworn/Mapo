```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Efficient copy from global to shared memory reduces latency
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Use __syncthreads() strategically to ensure memory consistency
// Minimize divergence in conditionals for halos
// Optimize halo copying by minimizing memory bandwidth usage
// Calculate indices carefully to avoid redundant computations
// Use shared memory for stencil calculations to improve access time
