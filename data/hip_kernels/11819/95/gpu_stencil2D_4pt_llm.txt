// Optimize shared memory loading by coalescing global memory accesses.
// Reduce redundant calculations of indices within loops.
// Use vectorized memory operations where possible to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent memory access patterns or thread divergence within branches.
// Consider tuning TILE_SIZE for best occupancy and performance balance.
