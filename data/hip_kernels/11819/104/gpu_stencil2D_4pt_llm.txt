```
// Ensure enough shared memory is declared to accommodate halos and the main tile.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by declaring shared memory dynamically when possible.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring global memory accesses are contiguous.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading to shared memory.
// Exploit the spatial locality by copying a larger section of the grid to shared memory in one go.
// Consider unrolling loops for improving computation-related parallelism.
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by maximizing the use of shared memory.
// Reduce occupancy loss through better handling both computation and memory latency.
