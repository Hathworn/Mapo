```cpp
// Coalesce global memory accesses for better performance.
// Use prefetching to minimize data transfer delays.
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized within kernel limits.
// Align data structures in shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to indicate no overlap in pointer data.
// Optimize loop unrolling where appropriate for better execution efficiency.
// Use appropriate block and thread configuration for maximizing occupancy.
