```
// Consider using shared memory to coalesce memory accesses and reduce global memory traffic
// Precompute indices outside of loops to minimize arithmetic operations within the loop body
// Align memory accesses to increase data throughput and reduce memory transactions
// Avoid branch divergence by restructuring conditions
// Optimize loop unrolling for better performance and efficient instruction pipeline usage
// Utilize memory coalescing to group threads for efficient data fetching into shared_memory
