```c
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to reduce pointer aliasing overhead.
// Utilize shared memory to coalesce global memory access and minimize bank conflicts.
// Consider padding shared memory to prevent access conflicts and improve performance.
// Prefetch global memory data into registers where possible to decrease memory latency.
// Assess loop unrolling techniques to decrease the overhead of loop control statements.
// Analyze shared memory usage to ensure maximum occupancy and efficiency.
// Reduce redundant calculations by leveraging registers for variable storage.
// Ensure data alignment at 128-byte boundaries to optimize memory transactions.
