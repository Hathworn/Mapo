```
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in 'dst' and 'shared_rows'.
// Consider using shared memory collaboratively among threads in a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Explore optimizing the memory alignment to avoid unnecessary warp serialization.
// Evaluate if increasing the tile size ('tile_x', 'tile_y', 'tile_z') could improve occupancy and reduce memory access overhead.
// Determine if prefetching necessary data into shared memory before computation could help in reducing memory latency.
