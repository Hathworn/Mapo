```
// Use shared memory to cache data for faster access and reduced global memory traffic.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to optimize global memory bandwidth usage.
// Minimize divergence by checking boundaries before accessing data.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by adjusting data layout if necessary.
