```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring global memory accesses are contiguous for each warp
// Use shared memory to reduce frequent global memory access within the kernel
// Minimize register pressure by reducing the number of variables and optimizing their use
// Consider loop unrolling for the for loop to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Avoid divergent branching by ensuring conditions are warp-friendly
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used effectively to synchronize threads when necessary
// Optimize memory accesses such that they follow the principles of memory hierarchy for faster access
