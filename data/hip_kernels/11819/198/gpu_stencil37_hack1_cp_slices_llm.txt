```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Apply loop unrolling to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Ensure memory accesses by all threads within a warp are contiguous.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization.
