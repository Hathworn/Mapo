```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Prefetch data to shared memory to hide memory latency
// Check bank conflicts in shared memory and arrange data to avoid them
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of the warp size
// Minimize divergence by avoiding conditional statements inside loops
// Align data structures to achieve better memory alignment
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
