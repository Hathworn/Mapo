```
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency
// Precompute repeated index calculations outside conditional statements
// Minimize conditional checks within the memory access critical path
// Favor arithmetic operations over multiple access to global memory
// Ensure alignment of shared memory accesses to maximize coalescing
// Consolidate index updates for subsequent accesses
```
