```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize shared memory usage by optimizing the size and access patterns.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring aligned data access.
// Preload the halo region efficiently to reduce idle time.
// Ensure the dimensions of shared memory are optimal for memory access patterns.
// Utilize derived block and grid sizes that align with the hardware's capabilities.
// Balance the workload among threads to minimize divergence and idle time.
// Optimize kernel launch parameters to best match the GPU's compute resources.
// Use appropriate synchronization (`__syncthreads()`) to ensure data consistency.
