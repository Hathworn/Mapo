```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with memory boundaries
// Minimize divergent branches by consolidating conditions
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently reused data to reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize __syncthreads() efficiently to synchronize threads only when necessary
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
```
