```
// Consider using constant memory for frequently reused values like HALO and N.
// Align memory accesses to increase memory bandwidth efficiency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing redundant loads.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper indexing.
// Explore loop unrolling beyond pragma directives for further performance improvement.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for neighboring element access to reduce shared memory dependency.
// Balance work among threads for optimal utilization and latency hiding.
// Evaluate potential use of asynchronous data transfers for overlapping computation with memory operations.
