```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access patterns.
// Minimize global memory transactions by loading data into shared memory.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve performance.
// Use __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.
// Only load legal indices to avoid unnecessary memory operations.
// Maximize the use of shared memory within tile dimensions constraints.
// For higher efficiency, consider occupancy and thread block sizing.
