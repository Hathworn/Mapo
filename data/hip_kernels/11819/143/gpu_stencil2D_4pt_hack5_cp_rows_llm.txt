```
// Optimize memory access by utilizing shared memory for frequently accessed rows.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads to minimize non-coalesced memory reads.
// Leverage __syncthreads() to synchronize threads when using shared memory to prevent race conditions.
// Consider using texture or constant memory for repeated read-only data access to reduce global memory latency.
