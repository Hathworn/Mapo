```
// Ensure memory coalescing by having threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Check for boundary conditions to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block after memory operations
// Ensure __syncthreads() is called after updating shared memory to maintain consistency
