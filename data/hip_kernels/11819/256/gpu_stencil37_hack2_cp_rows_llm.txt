```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to minimize the number of global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory alignment to improve access speed.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for intra-block synchronization instead of __syncthreads.
// Evaluate if texture memory could provide advantages for certain access patterns.
// Minimize the use of conditional branching to maintain consistent execution within warps.
// Investigate potential use of loop unrolling to reduce loop iteration overhead.
