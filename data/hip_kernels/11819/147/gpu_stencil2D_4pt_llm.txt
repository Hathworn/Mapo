```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring global reads and writes are aligned
// Use shared memory to minimize repeated global memory access
// Handle the boundary conditions and halos carefully to prevent race conditions
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used for synchronization after shared memory operations
// Use a single thread for halo copying to reduce redundant computations and memory access
