```
// Ensure shared memory is allocated appropriately to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointer declarations to inform the compiler of non-aliasing.
// Optimize memory access pattern for better cache utilization by ensuring data accesses are contiguous.
// Utilize warp-level operations where possible to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Verify grid and block dimensions to match hardware constraints for better performance.
// Examine use of atomic operations if there are race conditions affecting shared memory.
