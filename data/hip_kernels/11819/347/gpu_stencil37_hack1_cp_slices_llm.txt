```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning base_global_col with warp size.
// Move condition outside loop to further reduce redundant checks.
// Minimize thread divergence by structuring conditionals carefully.
// Consider using shared memory for the frequently accessed n_cols and n_rows variables to reduce global memory access.
// Utilize loop unrolling for the inner for loop with tile_y to improve performance.
// Align shared memory allocation to warp boundaries to improve memory access efficiency.
