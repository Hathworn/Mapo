// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access to maximize performance
// Minimize usage of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
