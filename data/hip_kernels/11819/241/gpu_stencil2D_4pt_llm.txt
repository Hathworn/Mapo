```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced global memory access
// Utilize shared memory fully by minimizing redundant data copies and maximizing data reuse
// Ensure boundary conditions in shared memory copying to minimize global memory reads
// Optimize halo copying by consolidating shared memory operations to avoid thread divergence
// Tweak block and tile dimensions to match hardware capabilities and optimize for occupancy
// Remove unnecessary __syncthreads() after the last operation to improve performance
