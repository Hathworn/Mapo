```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for dst array.
// Ensure memory access within bounds to avoid out-of-bound errors.
// Optimize data copying by loading multiple elements using vectorization.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize thread computation after shared memory access.
