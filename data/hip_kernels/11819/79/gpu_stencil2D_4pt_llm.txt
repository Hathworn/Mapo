```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access patterns for src and dst arrays.
// Use double-buffering in shared memory to overlap computation and data transfer.
// Optimize shared memory banking to avoid bank conflicts.
// Examine whether more non-overlapping threads can be used to further improve memory access efficiency.
// Profile memory operations to identify potential bottlenecks and adjust your memory access patterns accordingly.
// Explore the usage of the HIP occupancy calculator tool to maximize thread-level parallelism.
