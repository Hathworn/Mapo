```
// Use shared memory to store slices and reduce global memory access within the loop.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads to contiguous memory segments.
// Minimize redundant calculations by computing indices outside of loops where possible.
// Implement loop unrolling where feasible to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if subsequent operations reuse the same data.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory usage for consistency.
