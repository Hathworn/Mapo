```
// Pre-compute global indices to reduce redundant calculations and improve register usage.
// Merge multiple conditional checks to minimize branching and improve warp execution efficiency.
// Use shared memory effectively to store reused data and reduce global memory access latency.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure memory operations are synchronized across threads in a block.
