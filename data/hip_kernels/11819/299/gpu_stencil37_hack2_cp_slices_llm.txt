```
// Reduce redundant calculations by combining them.
// Calculate indices once, reuse them to improve performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data and access patterns.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Consider block and thread dimensions to optimize occupancy.
