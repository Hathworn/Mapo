```
// Consider further optimizing memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Evaluate if using float instead of double could offer performance improvements, if precision allows.
// Inspect shared memory usage and ensure that no bank conflicts are occurring.
// Check if loop unrolling could improve performance in stencil operation phases.
// Examine the thread block size and grid size for optimal GPU occupancy and memory throughput.
// Explore the potential of asynchronous data prefetching to hide memory latencies.
// Consider splitting the workload to improve load balancing across threads/blocks.
// Review the potential benefits of using texture memory for read-only data to improve cache performance.
