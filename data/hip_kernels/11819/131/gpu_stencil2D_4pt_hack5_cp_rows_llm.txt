```cpp
// Ensure that memory access is coalesced for better performance.
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions.
// Optimize the thread block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to improve memory access patterns.
// Consider reducing the use of __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead if possible.
