// Minimize memory accesses by combining conditions for legalCurCol, legalCurSlice, and legalNextRow.
// Consider optimizing global memory access patterns by coalescing reads.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Align shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts.
// Prefetch data for the next iteration to hide memory latency.
