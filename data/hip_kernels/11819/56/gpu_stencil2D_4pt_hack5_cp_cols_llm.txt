```
// Consider coalesced memory access for global memory reads to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for reading global memory if the data is read-only to exploit texture cache.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring access patterns avoid multiple threads accessing the same bank.
// Verify if __syncthreads() is essential in the current context to reduce potential synchronization overhead.
