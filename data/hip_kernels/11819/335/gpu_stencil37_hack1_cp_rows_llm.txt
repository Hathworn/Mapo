```c
// Precompute indices outside loops to minimize redundant calculations
// Perform boundary checks once and use boolean flags to optimize conditional checks
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to take advantage of faster memory accesses
// Unroll loops for better instruction-level parallelism and reduced branch divergence
```
