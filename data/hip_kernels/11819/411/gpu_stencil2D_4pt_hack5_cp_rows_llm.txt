```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for dst to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized to prevent bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if prefetching data into shared memory can further hide memory latency.
// Check if __syncthreads() can be minimized while maintaining correctness to reduce synchronization overhead.
