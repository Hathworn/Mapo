```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Reduce numerator calculation redundancy by pre-computing values for repeated operations.
// Use loop unrolling to optimize repetitive operations and improve memory access patterns.
// Verify memory coalescing for read and write operations to enhance performance on the GPU.
// Ensure data alignment to leverage hardware-specific instructions and avoid unaligned access penalties.
// Minimize control flow divergence within the kernel to improve efficiency.
