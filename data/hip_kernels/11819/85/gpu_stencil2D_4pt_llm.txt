```
// Consider using loop unrolling within the TILE_SIZE loops for better ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Ensure adequate shared memory allocation to prevent bank conflicts, which would improve memory access speed.
// Optimize boundary condition checks by minimizing redundant calculations in the halo region.
// Utilize vectorized memory accesses where possible to exploit data coalescing for global memory.
// If applicable, explore using mixed precision to reduce memory bandwidth requirements and improve performance.
// Evaluate using alternative memory spaces, such as the texture memory, for read-only data to offload pressure on global memory.
