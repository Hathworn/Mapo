```
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'a' and 'b' arrays to improve performance
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic and improve latency
// Optimize reduction using fewer __syncthreads to minimize synchronization overhead
// Consider using warp shuffle functions to avoid shared memory for the final reduction within a warp
