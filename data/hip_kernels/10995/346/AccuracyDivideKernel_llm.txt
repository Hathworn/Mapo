```
// Consider using cooperative groups for better synchronization control
// Ensure the variable accuracy is in shared memory if accessed by multiple threads
// Minimize use of global memory by caching important data in registers
// Avoid warp divergence by having uniform execution paths
// Optimize thread block size for maximum occupancy
// If N is constant, consider using __constant__ memory for better performance
