```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory performance.
// Consider using warp-level primitives or cooperative groups to further optimize reductions.
// Minimize divergent branching by aligning conditions within warp boundaries.
// Pre-fetch data into shared memory for reused items to reduce global memory traffic.
// Investigate potential bank conflicts in shared memory access.
