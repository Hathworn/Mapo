```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for src_image to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to cache src_image data tiles for each block to reduce global memory traffic.
// Align rects data to improve memory access patterns and cache efficiency.
// Optimize dst_ptr accesses to ensure coalesced writes by aligning the gid computation.
// Use float2 and int2 types for 2-element accesses to reduce the number of instructions.
