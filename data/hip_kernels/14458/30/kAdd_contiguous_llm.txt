```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Use vectorized data types if possible, such as float2, for improving throughput
// Ensure alignment of data to optimize memory transactions
// Minimize host-device memory transfers by overlapping with computation if possible
```
