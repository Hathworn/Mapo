```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure proper memory coalescing by aligning data structures appropriately.
// Use asynchronous memory transfers to overlap data movement and computation.
// Tune grid and block sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads.
// Profile the kernel and leverage local memory if register spilling is observed.
// Experiment with loop unrolling to enhance instruction throughput.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
