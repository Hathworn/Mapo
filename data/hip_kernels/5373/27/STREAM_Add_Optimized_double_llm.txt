```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data and maximizing contiguous access
// Use appropriate block size to maximize occupancy and load balance
// Minimize memory latency by overlapping computation with memory access if possible
```
