```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing memory within a warp
// Consider using shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data are needed
// Make sure the grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy on the GPU
// Utilize asynchronous memory transfers if applicable to overlap computation with data movement
