```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve throughput
// Ensure that the data arrays 'a' and 'b' are aligned to avoid misaligned memory access
// Consider using shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data are required
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy
// Utilize multiple streams if performing other independent tasks
