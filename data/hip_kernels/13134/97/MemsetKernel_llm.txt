// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring image[i * w + j] is coalesced.
// Leverage warp-level primitives for reduction when applicable to improve efficiency.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
