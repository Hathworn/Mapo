```
// Use shared memory to cache normalization factors to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling if possible to increase computational throughput
// Utilize asynchronous copy operations if the kernel launch is not memory-bound
// Ensure coalesced memory access for both reading normalization_factor and writing image
// Maximize occupancy by choosing optimal block size considering register usage
