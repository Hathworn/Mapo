```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced when reading loc_ array.
// Consider using shared memory if loc_ is accessed multiple times.
// Check if float4 or int2 conversions could better utilize memory bandwidth for loc_.
// Ensure consistent access patterns for x and y to maintain coalesced writes.
// Profile the kernel to identify any bank conflicts within shared memory if applicable.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to further optimize memory throughput.
// Ensure that all data are properly aligned for efficient memory access.
