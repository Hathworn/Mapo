```cpp
// Use __restrict__ pointers if A, B, and C do not alias to improve memory access
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within a block is possible
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous memory in A, B, and C
// Experiment with different block sizes for performance tuning
```
