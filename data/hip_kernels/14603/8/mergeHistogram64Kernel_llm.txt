// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning d_PartialHistograms access patterns.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory transactions.
// Synchronize threads within the block to ensure completeness of shared memory operations.
// Minimize global memory writes by reducing them to a single operation per block.
