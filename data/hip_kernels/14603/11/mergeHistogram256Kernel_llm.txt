```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Ensure kernel launches with sufficient occupancy for the hardware
// Consider using warp-based reduction to improve efficiency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can benefit the reduction steps
