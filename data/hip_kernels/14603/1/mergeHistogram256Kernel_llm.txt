```cpp
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory performance
// Align partial histogram reads to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more optimized reduction
// Ensure optimal grid and block size to maximize occupancy and efficiency
// Minimize shared memory usage to allow more blocks per SM
