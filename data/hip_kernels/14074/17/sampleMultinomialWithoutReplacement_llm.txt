```cpp
// Use shared memory to avoid repeated global memory accesses for 'normDistPrefixSum'.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is called to synchronize threads after shared memory load.
// Perform binary search in shared memory to reduce latency.
// Set 'origDist' to 0.0f after selection to ensure no repeated sampling.
