```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache input and kernel to reduce global memory accesses
// Use coalesced global memory accesses for input and kernel to improve memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling in the convolution loops to reduce loop overhead and improve ILP
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Utilize __syncthreads() efficiently to ensure memory operations are synchronized across threads
