// Check if memory coalescing is achieved when accessing d_Input and d_Result
// Use appropriate block size to maximize occupancy and utilize shared memory efficiently
// Consider unrolling the reduction loop for further performance optimization
// Evaluate using atomic operations if the reduction grid is small
// Ensure alignment of shared memory allocations for efficient access
