// Use coalesced memory access to optimize global memory read/write
// Align memory allocations to avoid bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into shared memory if possible for additional speedup
// Ensure that global memory accesses are fully utilized by all threads
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and efficiency
