```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing input and output in a linear fashion
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory if reuse exists
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same code path
// Analyze memory access patterns to identify potential bank conflicts
// Use __restrict__ keyword for input and output pointers to optimize compiler optimizations
// Profile and adjust block and grid dimensions based on the target hardware
// Explore the use of asynchronous data transfers to overlap computation and communication
