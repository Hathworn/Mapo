// Consider using shared memory to cache input elements for threads within the same block
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimal and do not cause unnecessary bank conflicts
// Evaluate if using warp primitives can help reduce latency in logf and fabsf operations
// Check if preferring constant memory for frequently accessed variables can improve performance
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by adjusting block size for better utilization of compute resources
