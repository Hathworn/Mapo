```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize register usage to increase occupancy
// Reduce divergent branches to improve performance
// Consider unrolling loops for better instruction throughput
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input and output arrays
// Optimize memory access patterns to take advantage of the L2 cache
