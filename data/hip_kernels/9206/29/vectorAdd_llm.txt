// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Try to utilize shared memory if there's a need to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure proper usage of grid and block dimensions for full utilization of GPU resources.
// Avoid thread divergence to maintain optimal performance.
