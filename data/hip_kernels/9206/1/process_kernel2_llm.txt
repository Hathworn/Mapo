// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring adjacent threads access sequential memory.
// Improve L1 cache utilization by optimizing memory access patterns if possible.
// Reduce memory latency by employing shared memory for repeated values or block-level data.
// Evaluate the necessity of precision for operations to switch to lower precision for faster performance.
