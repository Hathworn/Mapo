```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with consecutive memory elements
// Minimize register usage by using inline calculations instead of storing intermediate results
// Optimize memory throughput by preferring float over double for single-precision operations
// Consider restructuring grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and workload distribution
