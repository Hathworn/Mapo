```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access contiguous memory locations
// Evaluate the use of shared memory if multiple threads need access to the same data
// Ensure data alignment for better memory access efficiency
// Minimize data transfer between host and device by processing larger data sets in a single kernel launch when feasible
// Examine potential loop unrolling where applicable if there are repeated patterns or operations
