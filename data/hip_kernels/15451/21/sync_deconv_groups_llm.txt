```cpp
// No memory access in current global kernel function to optimize 
// Consider memory coalescing when adding device memory accesses
// Ensure memory alignment to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data if applicable
// Minimize global memory transactions by optimizing loop structures
```
