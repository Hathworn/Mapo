```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Use memory coalescing for efficient global memory read/write.
// Ensure aligned memory accesses for better performance.
// Leverage loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.
// Minimize branch divergence within warps.
// Prefetch data to hide memory latency.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources.
