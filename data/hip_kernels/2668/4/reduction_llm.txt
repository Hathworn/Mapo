```
// Use warp shuffle operations to optimize reduction within a warp
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Use multiple blocks to increase parallelism for large inputs
// Ensure input is aligned to avoid misaligned memory accesses
// Allocate shared memory dynamically if TPB is unknown at compile time
// Evaluate using cooperative_groups for better warp-level parallelism
