```
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access.
// Consider using float2 or float4 to increase data throughput.
// Use constant memory for small data, like the gamma value, if applicable.
// Explore occupancy optimizations by adjusting block size and grid size.
// Ensure that the memory reads and writes are aligned to avoid performance penalties.
