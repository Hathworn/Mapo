```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses by caching input data per block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning input and output arrays with warp boundaries.
// Implement loop unrolling if multiple operations are to be conducted within the kernel.
// Assess potential benefits of using __half precision to reduce memory bandwidth requirements.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously if synchronizing shared memory data is necessary.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and thereby maximizing throughput.
