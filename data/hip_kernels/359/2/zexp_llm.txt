```
// Apply loop unrolling to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead and increasing instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning consecutive threads to access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate computational results if register usage becomes a bottleneck.
// Use the __expf() intrinsic function for single-precision exponentiation to take advantage of its lower latency compared to standard functions.
