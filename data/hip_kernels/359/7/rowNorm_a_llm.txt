```
// Consider using shared memory for v[row] and a[row] to reduce global memory access.
// Use memory coalescing techniques by ensuring that threads access contiguous segments of global memory to improve performance.
// Re-evaluate loop increments to fully utilize blockDim and gridDim for better load balancing across threads.
