```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Try to optimize memory access patterns to be coalesced
// Ensure that the number of threads per block maximizes occupancy
// Evaluate if reducing register usage can improve performance
// Assess if the use of warp shuffle functions can optimize data sharing between threads
