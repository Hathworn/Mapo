```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for reduced global memory access latency
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns when accessing global memory
// Reduce divergent branches in the kernel to increase warp execution efficiency
// Use larger thread blocks to improve GPU resource utilization
// Attempt loop unrolling if applicable to reduce control overhead
