```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for neighboring elements
// Explore memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory accesses by threads within a warp
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning data accesses
// Leverage constant memory for constants like 'k' and 'st' if access patterns are regular
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy and efficient memory throughput
// Evaluate the use of texture memory if appropriate for the 3D data pattern
