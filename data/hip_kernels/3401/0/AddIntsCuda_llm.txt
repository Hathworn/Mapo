```
// Use shared memory for coalesced access patterns when appropriate to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure N is defined and optimized based on available memory and performance measurements.
// Consider loop unrolling if the operation inside the kernel is suitable and results in decreased execution time.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find optimal configuration for the specific hardware.
