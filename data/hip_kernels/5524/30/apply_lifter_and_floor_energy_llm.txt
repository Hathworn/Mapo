```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for lifter coefficients
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used after writing to shared memory to synchronize all threads
// Load lifter coefficients into shared memory conditionally to minimize memory usage
// Use a loop incremented by blockDim.x to allow for coalesced memory access pattern
// Assign frame-specific energy only once per block by using threadIdx.x == 0
