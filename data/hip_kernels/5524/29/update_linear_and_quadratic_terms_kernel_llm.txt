```
// Prefetch cur_weight to reduce global memory access
// Compute new_scale outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations
// Use the ternary operator to simplify new_scale computation
// Optimize loop unrolling with a consistent increment pattern
// Simplify quadratic index calculation with precalculated common expressions
// Minimize divergence by reducing condition checks for atomic operations
