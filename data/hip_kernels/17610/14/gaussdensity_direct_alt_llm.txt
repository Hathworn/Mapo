// Consider using shared memory to store xyzr array for faster atom data access within each block.
// Optimize coalesced global memory access patterns for densitygrid updates.
// Reduce redundant computations by calculating gridspacing_coalesce outside the atom loop.
// Ensure thread synchronization if shared memory is used to prevent race conditions.
