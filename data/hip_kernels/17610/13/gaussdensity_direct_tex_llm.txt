```c
// Use shared memory to cache xyzr and colors arrays per block to reduce global memory access
// Align memory access patterns for better coalescing by using a fixed stride (gridspacing_coalesce) 
// Aggregate memory updates at the end to reduce repeated memory accesses
// Optimize loop unrolling factor DUNROLLX to balance computational workload and register usage
// Consider using texture memory for the xyzr and colors arrays for faster read access
