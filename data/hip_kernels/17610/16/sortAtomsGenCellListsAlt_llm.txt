```c
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures to 128 bits
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access latency
// Prefetch data to shared memory where possible for reuse
// Minimize divergent branching inside kernel
// Consider memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Optimize boundary checks by limiting branch divergence
```
