// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses in global memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Investigate using warp-level primitives for further optimization
// Analyze the effectiveness of the loop unrolling and adjust the unrolling factor accordingly
