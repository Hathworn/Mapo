// Consider coalesced memory access for galaxy_set to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Apply loop unrolling for the loop inside the kernel to reduce loop overhead
// Analyze potential use of memory prefetching to hide global memory latency
