// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Ensure that all arrays are properly aligned and padded to avoid bank conflicts.
// Analyze and optimize the usage of registers to maximize occupancy.
// Minimize thread divergence in the kernel execution.
