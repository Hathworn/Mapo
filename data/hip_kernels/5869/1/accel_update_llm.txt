```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to cache data for reuse and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure all threads within a block are active to maximize warp efficiency
// Explore loop unrolling for operations within the kernel to enhance performance
