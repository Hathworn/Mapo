// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure each thread reads/writes contiguous memory to maximize coalesced access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and avoid race conditions when transposing
// Consider adjusting tile size based on GPU architecture and shared memory limits to improve performance
// Verify boundary conditions to avoid memory access beyond allocated array limits
