// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure that shared memory access is coalesced by properly aligning indices.
// Reduce memory divergence by synchronizing threads after accessing shared memory.
// Maximize warp occupancy by optimizing loop iterations with power of two strides.
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() calls to avoid unnecessary barriers.
