```
// Use dynamic shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Direct initialization minimizes conditional branching
// Optimize loop for power of two for effective reduction
// Employ volatile for warp-level operations to prevent compiler optimization issues
// Unroll the last warp to maximize instruction-level parallelism
// Store the result from shared memory to global memory
