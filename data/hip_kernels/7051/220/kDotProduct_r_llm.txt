```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns for 'a' and 'b'
// Consider reducing shared memory bank conflicts by restructuring memory access
// Use loop unrolling for accumulation to enhance performance
// Minimize divergence by aligning condition checks within the warp
// Optimize shared memory reduction by using efficient unrolling techniques
// Use warp shuffle to finalize reduction operations for better warp convergence
// Ensure only minimal synchronization barriers are present to reduce overhead
