```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Avoid warp divergency by ensuring threads execute similar instructions
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning data properly
// Use atomic operations if the kernel involves aggregating results across threads
