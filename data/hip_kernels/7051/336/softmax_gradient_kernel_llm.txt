```
// Consider using shared memory to cache dY and Y to reduce global memory access
// Apply loop unrolling techniques for both the reduction and gradient calculation loops
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved bandwidth utilization
// Utilize warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for faster reduction
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize for GPU hardware architecture
