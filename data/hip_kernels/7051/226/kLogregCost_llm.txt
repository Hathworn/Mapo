```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning memories such that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if possible.
// Optimize memory access patterns to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Minimize the use of __float2int_rd and __int2float_rn conversions inside loops as much as possible.
// Evaluate atomic operations' performance impact, and ensure they're necessary and optimally used.
// Explore loop unrolling strategies to reduce loop overhead if numOut is known at compile time.
