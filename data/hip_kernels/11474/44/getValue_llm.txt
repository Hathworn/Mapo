```
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access overlapping data
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput
// Align memory access to 128 or 256 bytes when possible to utilize full bandwidth
// Investigate the use of __ldg() for read-only data access to cache data efficiently
 // Explore warp-level primitives to reduce warp divergence
