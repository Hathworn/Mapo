```
// Consider using shared memory for more data elements to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement double buffering to overlap computation and data transfer
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Optimize for warp divergence by minimizing branching within warps
// Experiment with loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Profile the kernel to identify additional hotspots for optimization
