```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads and data in a linear fashion
// Use shared memory if frequent data access is needed within blocks
// Optimize block size to fully utilize GPU resources and minimize overhead
// If data is read-only, consider using __restrict__ to allow better optimization by the compiler
// Align data to memory-boundaries to reduce memory access latency
