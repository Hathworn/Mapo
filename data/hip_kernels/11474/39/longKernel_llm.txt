```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for efficient global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize block and grid size based on GPU architecture for improved performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage by aligning data access patterns.
// Explore loop unrolling if operation inside kernel is more complex for reducing overhead.
