```c
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory accesses for input and output arrays.
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data within threads.
// Ensure adequate occupancy and hide memory latency with enough active threads.
// Evaluate the benefit of using __ldg() for read-only data to utilize texture memory caches.
// Prefetch data into registers if multiple operations will be performed on the same data element.
