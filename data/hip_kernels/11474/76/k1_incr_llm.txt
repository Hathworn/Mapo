// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for hardware's warp size to improve efficiency
// Consider memory alignment and padding to maximize memory throughput
// Ensure multiple threads access the same memory location to leverage shared memory
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead
