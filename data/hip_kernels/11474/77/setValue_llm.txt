```
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need to access the same data.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for optimized access patterns.
// Analyze warp divergence caused by the globalIdx check and optimize if possible.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring data resides in contiguous memory locations.
