```cpp
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access time
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the GPU architecture
// Check if loop unrolling can enhance performance
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
```
