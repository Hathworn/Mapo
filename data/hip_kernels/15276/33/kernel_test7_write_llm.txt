```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Reduce global memory reads by utilizing shared memory
// Ensure boundary checks are correctly implemented to avoid out of bounds access
// Reuse shared memory by pre-loading data to reduce redundant global memory access
// Optimize the number of active threads for the available data to improve occupancy
