```cpp
// Align memory accesses to reduce cache misses
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring memory accesses are coalesced
// Ensure the block size is a multiple of warp size to maximize warp occupancy
// Minimize memory transactions by optimizing stride access patterns
// Use shared memory if frequent data reuse is possible within threads
```
