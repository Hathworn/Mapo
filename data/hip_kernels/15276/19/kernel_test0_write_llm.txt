```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to improve access times when multiple threads access similar data
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses with warp size
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring threads access different memory banks concurrently
// Optimize thread block and grid size for better occupancy
// Evaluate the impact of different memory access patterns on performance
