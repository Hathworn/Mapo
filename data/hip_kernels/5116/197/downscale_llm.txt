```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data
// Use shared memory to store temporary values from gradOutput_data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize loop unrolling to enhance performance by ensuring memory accesses are efficient
// Ensure that memory access patterns follow memory transaction optimizations for better global load/store efficiency
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data pointers if there is no aliasing
// Minimize high-latency global memory access by reusing data from previous iterations when possible
