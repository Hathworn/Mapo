```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// If the matrix and resultVector have a regular access pattern, explore coalesced memory accesses to enhance efficiency.
// Check if using float2 or float4 types would benefit memory throughput by allowing vectorized memory operations.
