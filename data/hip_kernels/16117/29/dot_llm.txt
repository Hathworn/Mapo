```
// Unroll the loop to reduce overhead and increase performance
// Utilize shared memory to cache intermediate results for faster access
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by accumulating results in shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed their operations before proceeding
// Implement binary tree reduction to optimize summation
// Minimize global memory writes by aggregating partial results in shared memory
