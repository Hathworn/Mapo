```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory to minimize latency
// Synchronize threads to ensure all updates to shared memory are complete
// Use a stride to spread memory accesses and reduce conflict contention
// Perform atomic operations in shared memory first to minimize global memory contention
// Synchronize threads before writing back to ensure all local updates are complete
// Minimize global memory atomic operations by accumulating results in shared memory
