```
// Optimize global memory access by considering coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results if multiple threads require similar data.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths.
// Reduce the use of trigonometric and sqrt operations where possible to save computation cycles.
// Ensure proper use of vectorized types to leverage memory bandwidth effectively.
