```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible between threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure a[i] and b[i] are coalesced by aligning memory accesses with warp size for better performance.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if a, b, and c pointers do not overlap to allow the compiler more optimization opportunities.
// Check if loop unrolling could benefit performance by allowing more instructions to be executed in parallel.
