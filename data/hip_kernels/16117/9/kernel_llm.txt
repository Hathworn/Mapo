```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and latency
// Align memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp efficiency
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy
// Preload frequently used data into registers or shared memory
// Consider use of asynchronous copy and prefetching techniques
