```c
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for improved access speed
// Reduce warp divergence by ensuring all threads perform related operations
// Avoid using global memory directly within critical sections
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads/writes
```
