// Consider using the __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to optimize memory access
// Evaluate prefetching data into cache by modifying the loop for improved memory coalescing
// Explore using shared memory loading with coalesced reads to reduce latency
// Analyze the possibility of loop unrolling in the reduction phase for better performance
