```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Ensure shared memory arrays match the warp size for better efficiency
// Expand shared memory usage if all threads can use it without overflow
// Align data access to ensure non-overlapping bank accesses in shared memory
// Utilize thread block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and throughput
