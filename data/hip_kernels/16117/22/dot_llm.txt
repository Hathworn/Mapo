```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring memory coalescing
// Use loop unrolling to minimize instruction overhead
// Cache intermediate results in shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after writing to shared memory
// Optimize reduction using a stride approach to minimize divergence
// Consider using atomic operations for concurrent access to shared memory
