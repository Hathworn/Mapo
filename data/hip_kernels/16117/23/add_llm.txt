```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Experiment with different block sizes to find optimal configuration
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Check if N is a multiple of blockDim.x for efficient utilization of threads
// Use __syncthreads() if shared memory usage is implemented to prevent race conditions
