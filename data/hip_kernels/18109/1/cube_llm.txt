```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for d_in and d_out
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate computations if needed
// Minimize bank conflicts by utilizing aligned memory accesses
// Use __restrict__ keyword to enable compiler optimizations regarding pointer aliasing
// Exploit warp-level primitives or intrinsics for further speedup in reduction tasks
```
