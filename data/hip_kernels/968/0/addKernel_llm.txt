```
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve global memory access efficiency
// Make sure the grid size covers all elements to avoid out-of-bound access
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Align data structures to 128-byte boundaries for improved memory access patterns
// Evaluate if warp divergence is minimized in the kernel execution
