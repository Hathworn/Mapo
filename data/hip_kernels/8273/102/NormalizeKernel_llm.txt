```
// Ensure memory coalescing by using 1D index derived from 2D grid
// Prioritize thread access patterns that enable coalesced reads/writes
// Utilize warp-friendly conditional checks to minimize divergent branches
// Leverage row-major order for memory access to optimize cache usage
// Implement bounds check inside kernel to prevent out-of-bounds accesses
// Consider prefetching or shared memory for frequently accessed data
