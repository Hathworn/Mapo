```
// Consider coalesced memory access for u, v, and src arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data for u, v, and src to reduce latency
// Consider optimizing register usage to reduce pressure
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Evaluate the potential benefit of loop unrolling for performance
// Review use of float precision, consider if half precision is viable
// Investigate occupancy to ensure optimal warps are active
