```
// Use shared memory to cache data for improved memory access times if needed.
// Consider coalescing memory access for the scts1 array to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Explore using __ldg for cached read-only memory access if the data is read multiple times.
// Optimize index calculations further to reduce arithmetic operations.
// Verify alignment for memory access, as misaligned access can degrade performance.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead and improve throughput.
