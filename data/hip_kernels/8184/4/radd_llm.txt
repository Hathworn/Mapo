// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for coalesced access.
// Ensure that idx calculation is efficient and does not introduce extra computations.
// Use shared memory if appropriate to minimize global memory accesses.
// Evaluate if alpha can be stored in shared memory or registers to reduce continual loading from device memory.
