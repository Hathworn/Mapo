```
// Consider using shared memory for csum if the values can be reused across threads in the same block to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for fsum and csum to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if there's no aliasing, which may enable further compiler optimizations
