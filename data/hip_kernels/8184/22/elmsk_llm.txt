// Consider using shared memory to optimize data fetching from global memory
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Evaluate using more aggressive loop unrolling for better instruction throughput
// Consider warp-level optimizations to efficiently utilize computational resources
// Assess the impact of additional registers and cache utilization to reduce latency
