```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data properly in global memory
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling inside the grid-stride loop for better performance
// Adjust block and grid sizes to fully occupy the GPU and maximize throughput
// Profile kernel execution using performance counters to identify bottlenecks
