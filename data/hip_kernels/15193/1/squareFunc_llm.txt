```
// Group threads in warps to improve memory access patterns and efficiency
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve latency
// Coalesce global memory reads from d_in to maximize memory bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling for any operations inside the if condition to improve performance
// Minimize usage of branching with alternative logic to improve warp execution efficiency
