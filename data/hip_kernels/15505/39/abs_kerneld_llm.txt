```cpp
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Minimize memory usage by operating on data in-place when possible
// Attempt to increase occupancy by adjusting block and grid size
```
