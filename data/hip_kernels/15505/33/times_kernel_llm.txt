// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency
// Apply memory coalescing to enhance memory access efficiency
// Consider using vectorized data types for better memory throughput
// Load data in a coalesced manner to minimize transaction count
// Optimize for memory access patterns that align with warp execution
