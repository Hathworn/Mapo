```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory addresses
// Use shared memory if multiple threads need access to the same value
// Employ warp-level primitives to reduce redundant calculations
// Check if using fast_math library could benefit performance
// Minimize global memory access by preferring registers whenever possible
```
