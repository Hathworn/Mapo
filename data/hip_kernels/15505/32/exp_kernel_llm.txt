// Ensure coalesced memory access by arranging data in a manner that threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize divergent branches caused by the boundary condition check by using techniques like padding
// Optimize memory access patterns to fully utilize memory bandwidth
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses within warp
