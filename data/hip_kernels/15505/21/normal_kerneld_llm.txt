```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data reads to the warp boundaries
// Experiment with varying block sizes to find optimal occupancy and performance
// Utilize warp shuffle operations to reduce global memory accesses when possible
// Explore asynchronous memory transfers and prefetching for overlapping computation and data movement
