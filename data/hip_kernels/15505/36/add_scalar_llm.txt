```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal memory bandwidth utilization
// Adjust block size to maximize occupancy and better utilize the GPU resources
// Prefetch data to registers to enhance memory access speed
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
