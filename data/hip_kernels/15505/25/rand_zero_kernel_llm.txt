```
// Ensure that each thread accesses memory in a coalesced manner
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Make sure to exploit memory coalescing to minimize global memory transactions
// Use divergent conditions cautiously to avoid warp divergence
// Evaluate memory access patterns for alignment and efficiency
// Use manual loop unrolling cautiously to improve performance
// Avoid unnecessary recalculation of indices and reuse calculated values
// Verify memory accesses are properly aligned to prevent performance degradation
