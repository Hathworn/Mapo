// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure data fits within shared memory limits
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory loads/stores
// Verify grid and block dimensions are optimized for device occupancy
