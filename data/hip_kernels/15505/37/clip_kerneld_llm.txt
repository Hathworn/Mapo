```
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access nearby addresses to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better global memory throughput.
// Ensure enough active warps to hide memory latency; consider increasing the block size if needed.
// Use loop unrolling if the operation inside the loop is repeated for performance gain.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access if shared memory is used.
