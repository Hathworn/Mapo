```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize block size and grid size to maximize occupancy and reduce idle threads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Use constant memory for parameters like mean and std if they remain unchanged across threads.
// Explore persistent threads techniques for dynamic workloads to minimize kernel launch overhead.
// Consider pre-fetching data to hide memory latency.
