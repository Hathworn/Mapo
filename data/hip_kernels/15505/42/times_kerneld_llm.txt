```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Ensure memory alignment for better throughput
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Minimize conditional checks inside kernels where possible
```
