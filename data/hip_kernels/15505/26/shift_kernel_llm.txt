```
// Use shared memory to cache index calculations for repeated use
// Consider using __syncthreads() to ensure shared memory is synchronized across threads
// Unroll the copy_c and add_c loops further if significant C loop iterations are observed
// Minimize diverged branches in kernel launch configurations
// Align data access patterns for better coalesced memory access
