```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Ensure data alignment to avoid access penalties
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Minimize global memory accesses by using registers when possible
// Explore occupancy-based approaches for better utilization
```
