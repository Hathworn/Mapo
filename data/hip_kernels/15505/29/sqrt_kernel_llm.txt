// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure proper memory coalescing for global memory accesses by organizing data layout.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for potential performance improvements.
// Align data structures to ensure faster memory access on GPU.
// Optimize register usage to maximize parallelism within the kernel.
