```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Perform memory access checks to reduce divergent branching
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize inter-thread communication to improve warp execution
// Optimize atomic operations by reducing their frequency
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory access efficiency
