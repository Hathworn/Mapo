```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Load normalization factors into shared memory for coalesced access
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory is fully populated
// Perform division using a single operation to minimize computation
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced by checking the indices
