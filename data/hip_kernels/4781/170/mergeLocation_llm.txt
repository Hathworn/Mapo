```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for loc_, x, and y pointers to improve memory access performance
// Ensure loc_ is properly aligned to enable coalesced memory access
// Use constant memory if the scale value remains constant over kernel launches
// Utilize shared memory for loc_ if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal one for your hardware and input size
// If possible, avoid branching by restructuring logic or using bitwise operations
