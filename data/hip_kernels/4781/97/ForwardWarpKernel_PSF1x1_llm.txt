```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for the u, v, and src arrays.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the use of atomicAdd which may become a bottleneck due to contention.
// Assess occupancy and block size for better resource utilization.
// Minimize the divergence by ensuring all threads participate similarly in conditional branches.
// If possible, convert float operations to half to leverage hardware support for faster computation.
