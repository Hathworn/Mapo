// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring coalesced reads from input array
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results when possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid duplicate computations by restructuring loops for better cache efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and improve efficiency
