// Use shared memory to cache data between threads within the same block
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalesced reads and writes
// Minimize divergence by reducing conditional statements within the kernel
// Review occupancy and adjust block size to maximize parallel execution
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
