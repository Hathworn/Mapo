```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed variables
// Optimize memory access by aligning data to warp size
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to the image array
// Consider using float4 instead of float3 for better memory efficiency
// Reduce redundant calculations by storing intermediate results
// Assess the potential of using __restrict__ to enable compiler optimizations
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Investigate occupancy reduction by tuning block and grid sizes
