```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Consider unrolling the inner loop for better ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for optimal throughput
// Preload frequently used data into registers to lower access latency
// Analyze memory access patterns for cache optimization
