```
// Move stride_col calculation outside of the loop to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use __restrict__ keyword effectively to improve data access patterns and reduce aliasing.
// Consider using shared memory for better memory access latencies if applicable.
// Ensure optimal grid and block size configuration for full GPU utilization.
// Unroll inner loops further for maximizing throughput where applicable.
