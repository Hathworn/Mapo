```
// Combine loops to reduce the number of iterations and enhance performance.
// Minimize external memory access in the loop to avoid performance bottlenecks.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to cache frequently accessed data.
// Attempt to keep data in registers to reduce latency from global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Align memory access patterns to improve coalesced memory access.
// Ensure kernel launches work efficiently with warp size and multiprocessors.
// Check if use of `inline` can improve device function call performance.
