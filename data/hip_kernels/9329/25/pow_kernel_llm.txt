```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring INCX and INCY equal 1.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage if the block size is small enough.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions optimize occupancy and minimize idle threads.
// Align memory accesses to reduce potential bank conflicts.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory access latency.
// Consider loop unrolling if stride divides evenly into N for efficiency.
// Evaluate increasing block size for better use of chip resources.
