```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data layout for input and output buffers.
// Optimize the thread block size to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by aggregating results locally within each block before atomicAdd.
