```cpp
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory loads.
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring any potential warp divergence.
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy for better performance.
// Avoid redundant calculations by precomputing and storing frequently used values.
