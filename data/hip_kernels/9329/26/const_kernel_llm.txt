```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within blocks.
// Optimize block size to balance between parallelism and memory bandwidth.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling and other techniques to minimize branch divergence.
