```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache pred and truth data to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring blocks of threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using __ldg() intrinsic to minimize memory latency for read-only data
// Optimize thread occupancy by adjusting block size to maximize GPU utilization
