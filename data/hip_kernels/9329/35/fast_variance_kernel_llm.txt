```
// Use loop unrolling to reduce iteration overhead and increase computational efficiency
// Apply parallel reduction to minimize thread divergence and improve summation performance
// Avoid writing to global memory until necessary to reduce latency
// Ensure data is written to shared memory where possible to improve access times
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize coalescing and reduce memory bandwidth
