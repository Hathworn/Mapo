```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning consecutive threads to access consecutive memory addresses in the input and output arrays.
// Consider using shared memory for repeated accesses to the same data to reduce global memory reads.
// Utilize warp-level primitives for synchronization and reduction within a warp to boost performance.
// Investigate occupancy and adjust block size for optimal warp utilization and reduced memory latency.
// If atomic operations in the backward pass are a bottleneck, explore alternative methods like parallel reductions.
