```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory reads
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for better performance
// Consider using stream or asynchronous memory operations to overlap computation and data transfer
