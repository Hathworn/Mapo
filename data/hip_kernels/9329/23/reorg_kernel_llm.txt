```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance.
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel.
// Unroll loops or use warp shuffle to optimize for the target architecture.
// Strive to minimize register usage for better occupancy.
