// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance
// Evaluate the use of constant or texture memory for frequently accessed values
// Minimize data transfer by ensuring data resides in GPU as needed
