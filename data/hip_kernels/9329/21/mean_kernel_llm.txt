```
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage for different GPU architectures
// Utilize warp-level primitives to further enhance reduction performance
// Ensure __syncthreads() is necessary and correctly placed for synchronization
// Evaluate whether the block size suits the target hardware for occupancy
// Inspect if coalesced memory access is possible for global memory reads
// Adjust shared memory allocation size based on target GPU specifications
