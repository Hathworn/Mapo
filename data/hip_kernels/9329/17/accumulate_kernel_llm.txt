// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for coalesced access pattern.
// Ensure x array accesses are coalesced by aligning data based on groups.
// Reduce global memory writes by using atomic operations if applicable.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
