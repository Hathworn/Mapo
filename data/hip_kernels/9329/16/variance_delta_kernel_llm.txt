```c
// Consider using global memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations for the 'x' and 'delta' arrays.
// Prefetch data to shared memory for 'x', 'delta', and 'mean' to increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits to prevent low occupancy.
// Try loop unrolling techniques in the main loop to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput.
// Explore the use of atomic operations to handle aggregation of shared_memory across threads in different cases.
