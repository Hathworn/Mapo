```cpp
// Consider using shared memory more effectively by minimizing bank conflicts
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns to memory boundaries
// Ensure minimal divergence within warp execution to optimize throughput
// Reduce the use of atomic operations where possible to decrease contention
// Implement loop unrolling to improve performance through reduced loop overhead
// Investigate using double buffering techniques for overlapping computation and data transfer
// Prefetch data in registers to decrease latency and increase computational density
// Consider split-k strategies for better load balancing across threads
