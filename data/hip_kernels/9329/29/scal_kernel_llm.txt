// Consider using shared memory to hold temporary data for repeated access by threads
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the X array to maximize throughput
// Adjust block and grid sizes to balance memory usage and execution time
// Use __restrict__ to hint the compiler about non-aliasing pointers if applicable
// Explore loop unrolling for improved instruction-level parallelism
