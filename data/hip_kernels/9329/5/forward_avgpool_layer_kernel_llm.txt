```c
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data layout for better access patterns
// Reduce shared memory usage by optimizing the way input data is accessed
// Use vectorized loads and stores if applicable for increased efficiency
// Minimize warp divergence by optimizing control flow decisions
