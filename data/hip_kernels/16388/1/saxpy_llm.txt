// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring proper alignment of arrays if necessary
// Use coalesced access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for the SAXPY computation for improved instruction-level parallelism
// Check if shared memory usage can be optimized for better performance
