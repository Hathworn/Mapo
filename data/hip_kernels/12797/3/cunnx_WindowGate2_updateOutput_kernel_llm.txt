```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses when reading input_k
// Consider using float2 for coalesced memory access and increased throughput
// Ensure buffer initialization reduces bank conflicts in shared memory
// Optimize reduction loop to minimize thread divergence
// Consider loop unrolling in the reduction step for increased ILP
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring uniform control flow
// Utilize efficient use of ceilf and fminf/fmaxf to reduce computational overhead
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize memory latency
// Consider using asynchronous copies if supported to exploit memory bandwidth
// Minimize the number of syncthreads calls to reduce synchronization overhead
