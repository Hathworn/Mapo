```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointer variables to guide the compiler for optimizations
// Use coalesced memory access pattern by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts if possible
// Consider split kernel into multiple stages if register pressure is high
// Ensure enough occupancy by optimizing block size and grid size based on hardware
// Prefetch data into shared memory or registers to hide global memory latency
