```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve efficiency.
// Accumulate sums in shared memory to minimize memory access latency.
// Utilize __syncthreads() after writing to shared memory to ensure synchronization.
// Ensure the final accumulation is performed within shared memory to leverage faster access.
// Use __syncthreads() after the final summation to ensure all threads observe the update.
