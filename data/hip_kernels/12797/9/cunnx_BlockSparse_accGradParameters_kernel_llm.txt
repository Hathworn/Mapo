```cpp
// Optimize memory reads by coalescing global memory accesses.
// Consider using a 2D grid and block configuration for better cache utilization.
// Combine shared memory and register usage to minimize latency.
// Reduce the use of atomic operations where possible to avoid race conditions.
// Implement double buffering techniques for efficient input data loading.
// Explore using warp-level primitives for reducing shared memory synchronization.
// Investigate possible loop unrolling in the compute-intensive sections.
// Evaluate prefetching strategy for input and output data to minimize stalls.
