```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for gradOutput_k and output_k
// Use appropriate memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts within shared memory
// Try to optimize register usage to reduce spilling to global memory
// Use more efficient mathematical operations to reduce computational overhead
// Ensure memory alignment for float operations to utilize hardware capabilities fully
// Potentially replace the pow and exp functions with approximations if high precision is not critical
