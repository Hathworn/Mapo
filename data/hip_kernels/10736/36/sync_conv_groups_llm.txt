```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize data transfer from host to device by ensuring as much data as possible resides on the device.
// Use memory coalescing to optimize global memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Experiment with different block sizes and grid configurations to maximize hardware occupancy.
// Consider asynchronous memory transfers to overlap data movement with computation, reducing memory latency.
