// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing in accessing the array X for better performance.
// Try to align data structures to warp size to minimize bank conflicts.
// Optimize kernel launch parameters by adjusting block and grid sizes according to the hardware capabilities.
