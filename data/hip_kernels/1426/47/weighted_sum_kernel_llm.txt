```
// Ensure memory coalescing for global memory access
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same path
// Consider aligning data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Use loop unrolling if the function is called within a loop to reduce overhead
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better load balancing and occupancy
