```
// Precompute powf values outside loop to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use computation += syntax for direct updates to reduce variable assignments.
// Consider optimizing memory access by ensuring x, m, and v are in coalesced memory order.
// Ensure N is a multiple of blockDim.x where possible for efficient warp execution.
