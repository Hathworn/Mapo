```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory read/write efficiency.
// Reduce divergent branching by organizing condition checks to minimize warp divergence.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loops to decrease loop overhead and enhance performance.
// Optimize shared memory usage by preloading frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Use vectorized data types for data_im_ptr and data_col_ptr to enable more efficient data handling.
// Ensure thread-level parallelism is maximized by appropriately sizing grid and block dimensions.
