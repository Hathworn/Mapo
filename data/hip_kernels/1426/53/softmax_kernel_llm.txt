```
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling if 'n' is known at compile time for reduced overhead
// Pre-compute 'largest' using warp reduction to optimize performance
// Reduce number of division operations in normalization by using reciprocal
// Adjust block and grid sizes based on kernel launch configuration for optimal performance
