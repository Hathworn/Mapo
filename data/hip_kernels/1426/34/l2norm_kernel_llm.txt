```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Minimize use of sqrt and fmax operations by rearranging calculations if possible
// Use loop unrolling for the for-loop to increase throughput
// Ensure that all memory access patterns are aligned to improve performance
// Reduce the number of divisions by recalculating the inverse once
