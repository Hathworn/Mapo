```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring memory access patterns are aligned
// Minimize conditional branching within loop to improve thread execution predictability
// Use __syncthreads() strategically if data dependencies exist between threads within a block
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better SM utilization and load balancing
