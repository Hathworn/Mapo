// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Improve parallel reduction by avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory
// Utilize loop unrolling for faster iteration over spatial elements
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for x, delta, and variance arrays
// Leverage warp level primitives to optimize parallel reduction further
// Reduce branching divergence within loops for improved execution efficiency
