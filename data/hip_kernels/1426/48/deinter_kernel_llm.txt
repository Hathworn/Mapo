```
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory if possible.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to X and Y for improved performance.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize the reduction across OUT.
// Implement occupancy checks to ensure maximum kernel resource utilization.
// Profile memory usage to identify and eliminate any unnecessary memory transactions.
