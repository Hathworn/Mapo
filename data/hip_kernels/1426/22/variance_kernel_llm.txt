// Consider using cooperative loading into shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance memory access patterns and reduce loop overhead
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to ensure full occupancy and maximize parallelism
// Use warp-synchronous programming techniques to optimize shared memory usage and minimize synchronization overhead
