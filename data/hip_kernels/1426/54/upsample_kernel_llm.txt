```
// Use shared memory to cache inputs if there are repeated accesses
// Consider memory coalescing by adjusting data layout or access patterns
// Optimize for bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Explore occupancy optimization strategies, such as adjusting block size
// Utilize vectorized loads/stores for improved memory bandwidth
// Profile and minimize divergent branches, e.g., within the conditional
// Check if loop unrolling can improve performance for complex operations
// Evaluate constant memory usage for frequently accessed constants like stride
