// Use shared memory to reduce access to global memory, improving memory access efficiency.
// Unroll loops to decrease the loop control overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.
// Implement block-level reduction to minimize the number of global memory writes and reads.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize memory access across threads within a block after accumulation.
