```
// Consider coalesced memory access for pred and truth arrays
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure error and delta are accessed in a coalesced manner
// Evaluate usage of vectorized operations for improved throughput
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to better utilize device resources
// Investigate loop unrolling to decrease instruction overhead
