```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing consecutive elements in an array
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently used data
// Minimize divergence within warp by avoiding conditional statements if possible
// Leverage loop unrolling for instructions within the for loop
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on target hardware capabilities
