```
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for improved performance.
// Ensure INCX and INCY enable aligned memory access.
// Evaluate using shared memory if accessing the same data multiple times.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Optimize grid and block size according to N for better load balancing.
// Experiment with different launch configurations for optimal resource utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling for further optimization.
