```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly.
// Use shared memory to temporarily store values that are accessed multiple times.
// Preload data into registers to minimize global memory access latency.
// Use vectorized memory operations if possible to reduce the number of transactions.
// Ensure data alignment to avoid misaligned memory access penalties.
// Use memory access patterns that maximize the use of L2 cache.
// Reduce divergent branches, especially within conditional assignments.
// Ensure that thread blocks are of optimal size to fully utilize the GPU's execution resources.
// If applicable, explore using persistent threads to improve occupancy.
