```
// Consider coalesced memory access for the mask and x arrays to improve memory bandwidth.
// Ensure the grid and block sizes are optimized for the GPU architecture to maximize parallelism.
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses, if the operations allow caching.
