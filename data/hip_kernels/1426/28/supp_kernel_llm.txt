```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Evaluate the impact of using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory alignment to take advantage of warp memory efficiency.
// Avoid using bank-conflicted shared memory accesses if shared memory is utilized.
// Minimize divergent branching within the kernel to maintain warp efficiency.
