```
// Use shared memory to cache mask data for threads within the same block
// Coalesce memory accesses by restructuring data if possible
// Minimize conditional branches for performance improvements
// Align data accesses on natural boundaries for better performance
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction operations
