```
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced global memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory alignment for better performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Minimize register usage for better occupancy
// Consider loop unrolling for size variable for better latency hiding
