// Coalesce memory accesses for pred and truth arrays to improve memory access efficiency.
// Align memory accesses to enhance coalescing and reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate values to decrease global memory access latency.
// Optimize the use of registers by limiting duplicated calculations within each thread.
