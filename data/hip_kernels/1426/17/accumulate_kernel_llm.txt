```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary sums to reduce global memory access.
// Use memory coalescing techniques to optimize read access from global memory.
// Investigate using warp shuffle operations to improve reduction performance.
// Ensure that n is sufficiently large for benefits of loop unrolling.
