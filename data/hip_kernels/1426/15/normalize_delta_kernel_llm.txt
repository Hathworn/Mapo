```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables like mean and variance to reduce global memory accesses
// Preload mean[f], variance[f], mean_delta[f], and variance_delta[f] from global to local variables to reduce redundant memory transactions
// Use asynchronous data prefetching techniques to hide memory latency when accessing x[index] and delta[index]
// Coalesce memory accesses for delta and x to improve memory throughput
// Evaluate thread block size and grid configuration to better utilize the GPU architecture and achieve higher occupancy
