```
// Use coalesced memory accesses where possible
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Ensure stride access is coalesced for optimal memory performance
// Loop unrolling is already implemented - verify effectiveness
// Optimize ALPHA to be a constant for potential compiler optimization
// Review grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and performance
