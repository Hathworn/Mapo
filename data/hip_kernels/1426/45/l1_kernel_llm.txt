```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring pred, truth, delta, and error arrays are coalesced
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access overlapping regions of these arrays
// Investigate potential benefits of loop unrolling for the main computation
// Consider using __ldg() for loading read-only data like pred and truth if beneficial
