```
// Consider using shared memory to load chunks of x and reduce global memory accesses
// Align data access to coalesce memory transactions if possible
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by structuring conditions to avoid branching
// Evaluate using float2 or similar vector types for memory throughput optimization
// Profile and adjust block size to maximize warp occupancy
