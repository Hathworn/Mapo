```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for reuse among threads to reduce global memory transactions.
// Try coalescing memory accesses by organizing data so that adjacent threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Assess the possibility of reducing divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency.
