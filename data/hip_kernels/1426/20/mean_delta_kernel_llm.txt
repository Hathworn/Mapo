```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve global memory read efficiency
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring similar execution paths for threads
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce latency from global memory
// Balance workload among threads to avoid load imbalance
