```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that arrays a, b, and c are aligned and accessed in a way that utilizes burst reads/writes.
// If the data size is large, consider memory prefetching to hide latency.
// Utilize shared memory if there's any potential for data reuse within threads of the same block.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for the underlying hardware architecture.
