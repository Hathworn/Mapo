// Use shared memory to store intermediate results within the thread block to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve instruction throughput
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing to minimize memory latency
// Ensure alignment of data structures for efficient memory transactions
