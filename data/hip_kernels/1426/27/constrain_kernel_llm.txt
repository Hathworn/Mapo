// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory loads.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring memory reads are aligned.
// Use constant memory for variables like ALPHA that are not changed during kernel execution.
