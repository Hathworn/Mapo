// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access  
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data for sequential access by threads  
// Minimize register usage and avoid global memory redundancies  
// Evaluate warp occupancy and adjust block size for maximum efficiency  
// Use constant memory for read-only data that all threads access frequently  
// Maximize arithmetic intensity to minimize memory bandwidth bottlenecks
