```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to minimize global memory access.
// Optimize thread scheduling to ensure memory coalescing and avoid divergent branches.
// Prefetch data and use registers to minimize multiple accesses to the same global memory location.
// Check for potential data dependencies to allow loop unrolling for increased efficiency.
// Evaluate using constant memory for read-only data which is accessed by all threads.
