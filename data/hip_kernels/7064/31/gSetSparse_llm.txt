// Use shared memory to cache data locally for frequently accessed values and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling for iterative computation to decrease the number of loop control instructions.
// Optimize grid and block dimension settings to improve thread utilization and avoid underutilization of GPU resources.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations if there are potential conflicts in writing to 'out'.
