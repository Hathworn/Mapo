// Combine grid dimensions for more flexibility in thread allocation
// Ensure wide coverage of threads to better utilize available resources
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Explore coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Avoid unnecessary recomputation by caching intermediate results within threads
