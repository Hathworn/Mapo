```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous elements
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning data accesses to avoid shared memory conflicts
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed values to reduce global memory accesses
// Vectorize operations where possible to utilize memory bandwidth efficiently
// Optimize memory access patterns to increase cache hit rates
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by using conditional checks efficiently
