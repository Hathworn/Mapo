```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in memory.
// Ensure shared memory size is optimized and adequate for the block size.
// Minimize global memory access by maximizing shared memory usage.
// Ensure efficient memory access patterns to take advantage of memory bandwidth.
// Adjust block size and grid size for optimal performance and occupancy.
// Leverage warp-level primitives to reduce shared memory bank conflicts.
