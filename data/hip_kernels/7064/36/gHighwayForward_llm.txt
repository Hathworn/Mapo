// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Consider using memory coalescing techniques for better access patterns
// Evaluate the use of vectorized loads/stores for input and output arrays
// Ensure the kernel is launched with an optimal block and grid size
// Explore warp-level operations to improve parallelism efficiency
