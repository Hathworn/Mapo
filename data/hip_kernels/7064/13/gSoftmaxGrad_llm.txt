// Use shared memory for reduction to minimize global memory access
// Optimize the loop to reduce warp divergence
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure shared memory consistency
// Implement loop unrolling for further reduction in overhead
// Leverage constant memory if the valRow or adjRow data does not change frequently
