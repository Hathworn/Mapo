```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Minimize thread divergence within the warp when possible
// Consider loop unrolling for performance enhancement in the while loop
// Use atomic operations judiciously to avoid performance bottlenecks
// Profile to find warp serialization points and address them
// Ensure that grid and block dimensions are optimized for maximum occupancy
