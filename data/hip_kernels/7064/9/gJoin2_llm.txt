```
// Consider increasing block size to improve memory coalescing
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target device
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data inside loops
// Minimize usage of global memory inside loop
// Assess potential benefits of loop unrolling for the inner loop
// Balance load among threads by exploring different block dimensions
// Investigate use of warp shuffle for performance optimization
