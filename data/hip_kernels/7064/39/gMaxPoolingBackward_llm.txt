```
// Consider loading adjacent rows/cols for the block into shared memory to further improve memory coalescing.
// Avoid reading mask in a separate operation to benefit from memory coalescing.
// Investigate potential bank conflicts in shared memory loads for further optimization.
// Use warp shuffle instructions to reduce register usage and increase warp efficiency.
// Minimize synchronization cost by optimizing how shared memory is utilized across different threads.
