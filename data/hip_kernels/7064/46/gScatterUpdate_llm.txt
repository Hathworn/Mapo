```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sparseIndices is accessed sequentially
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure that denseData is aligned to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergence by restructuring the branches if possible
// Use a higher occupancy configuration to fully utilize GPU resources
