```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for denseData to improve memory throughput
// Implement shared memory caching if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access
// Use vectorized loads/stores to optimize memory transactions on denseData
// Ensure all memory allocations are properly aligned for improved access speed
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for denseData if applicable for improved locality
