```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Prefetch data into registers to decrease the number of memory accesses.
// Align memory accesses to utilize coalesced memory transactions.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Minimize branch divergence by structuring branching logic to be more uniform.
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Use atomic operations judiciously as they can serialize threads and reduce performance.
