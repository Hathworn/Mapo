```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures properly.
// Consider using shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses for xW and sU.
// Optimize thread block and grid dimensions for better occupancy.
// Utilize vectorized memory operations if possible.
// Check for memory alignment of out, cell, xW, sU, and b for efficient memory access.
// Employ loop unrolling to enhance the performance of the for-loop within the kernel.
