// Consider applying shared memory to store frequently accessed data like xWrow and sUrow
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes where possible
// Use atomic operations wisely to prevent performance bottleneck but ensure data integrity
// Explore loop unrolling for calculations within the kernel to reduce overhead
