```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments to improve memory access speed
// Ensure x and mask are memory aligned to increase coalescing potential
// Use shared memory if there are opportunities to reuse mask values within a block
// Increase occupancy by optimizing block size to match the target GPU architecture
// Minimize divergence by ensuring conditions inside loops are optimized
// Prefetch mask values to registers if repeated accesses are detected
