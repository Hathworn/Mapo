```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for mean and variance
// Ensure synchronization after loading mean and variance into shared memory
// Avoid redundant calculations by reusing shared_mean and shared_variance
// Consider optimizing thread blocks and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
