// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to coalesce global memory accesses
// Ensure that the shared memory size accommodates the maximum block size
// Evaluate if reducing shared memory usage per block can lead to better occupancy
// Investigate warp-level reduction to minimize atomic operations and barriers
