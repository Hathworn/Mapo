// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access for variables like w, h.  
// Explore using loop unrolling for the width-height iteration to minimize loop overhead and increase efficiency.  
// Assess if employing atomic operations are necessary to avoid race conditions when updating in_delta.  
// Evaluate if using specific warp-level optimization techniques could enhance performance for large n, c values.  
// Investigate memory coalescing for optimizing out_delta memory access to increase throughput.  
// Check if bank conflicts are present when accessing in_delta and address them if necessary.
