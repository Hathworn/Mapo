```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for a, b, s, and c to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the use of registers to minimize register spilling and maximize occupancy.
// Ensure that the kernel is compute-bound by optimizing arithmetic operations where possible.
// Align data structures to 32-byte boundaries to enhance memory access efficiency.
