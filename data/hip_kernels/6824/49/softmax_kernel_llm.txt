```
// Consider using shared memory for storing intermediate results to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize thread block size to balance between occupancy and performance.
// Evaluate using __syncthreads() for synchronizing threads during reduction if necessary.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for further performance improvements.
