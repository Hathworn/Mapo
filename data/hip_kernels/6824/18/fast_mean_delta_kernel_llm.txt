```
// Consider using shared memory for 'delta' to reduce global memory access
// Use memory coalescing techniques for accessing 'delta' to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure 'variance' is accessed in a coalesced manner to optimize global memory reads
// Experiment with loop unrolling further to find the optimal unroll factor for your GPU architecture
// Explore using warp-level primitives for additional optimization during reduction
