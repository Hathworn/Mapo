```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that input and rand arrays are aligned.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure usage of __restrict__ keyword for pointers to avoid pointer aliasing issues.
// Apply loop unrolling techniques if applicable to increase throughput.
// Verify if prefetching memory can benefit performance for specific data sizes.
