// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing.  
// Use shared memory for repeated access to ALPHA to reduce global memory reads.  
// Optimize INCX handling to ensure contiguous memory access if possible.  
// Evaluate warp size utilization for potential thread divergence optimization.
