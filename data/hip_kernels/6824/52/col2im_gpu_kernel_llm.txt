```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for data_col array
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure stride access pattern is optimal for memory coalescing
// Minimize the number of arithmetic operations in the loop
// Balance workload across threads effectively using loop unrolling
