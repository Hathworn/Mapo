// Ensure that global memory accesses are coalesced  
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access  
// Consider loop unrolling for further memory access optimization  
// Reduce the number of divergent branches for better execution efficiency  
// Align data structures to memory boundaries for faster access
