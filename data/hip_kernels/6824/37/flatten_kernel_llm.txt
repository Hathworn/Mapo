// Use shared memory for values frequently accessed within the same thread block to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring conditional branches are optimized.
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to leverage coalesced memory access for x and out arrays.
// Precompute all reusable values outside conditional branches to minimize redundant computation within threads.
// Ensure alignment of memory access for both x and out to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
