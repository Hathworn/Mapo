```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Stride the spatial access across threads to increase parallelism
// Prefetch mean[filter] to avoid repeated global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure correct reduction in shared memory
// Accumulate results using shared memory rather than atomic operations
