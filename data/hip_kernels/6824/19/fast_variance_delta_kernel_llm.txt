```
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing by ensuring thread accesses are contiguous
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding if necessary
// Use loop unrolling techniques consistently to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure that atomic operations are minimized to prevent performance bottlenecks
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize occupancy and performance
// Take advantage of shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
