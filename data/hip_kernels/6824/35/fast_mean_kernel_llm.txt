// Unroll the loop to improve memory access efficiency  
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access  
// Consider using atomic operations if necessary for reducing  
// Optimize warp divergence by aligning the number of threads with warp size  
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
