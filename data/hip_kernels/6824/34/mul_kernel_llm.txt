```
// Consider using shared memory to cache X and Y to reduce global memory access
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance
// Evaluate vectorized operations for potential memory coalescing improvements
// Implement loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput
// Ensure INCX and INCY values are optimal to minimize strided access
