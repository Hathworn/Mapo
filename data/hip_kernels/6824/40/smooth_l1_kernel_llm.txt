// Optimize memory access by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns for pred and truth arrays
// Consider using shared memory if there are shared computations across threads
// Minimize the use of global memory by reducing data fetching and storing
// Evaluate the occupancy of blocks and threads to ensure optimal resource utilization
