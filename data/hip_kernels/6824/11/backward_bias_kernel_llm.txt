```
// Collapse loops to reduce branch divergence and improve memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory for efficient accumulation of values
// Implement reduction within shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Use warp-level primitives to eliminate the need for __syncthreads() in final reduction steps
// Ensure global memory writes are minimized by accumulating shared memory before writing back
