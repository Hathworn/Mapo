```
// Use shared memory for biases to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize register space to store frequently accessed data like biases for faster access.
// Optimize block and grid size to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient memory bandwidth utilization.
