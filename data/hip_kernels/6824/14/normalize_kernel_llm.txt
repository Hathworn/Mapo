```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for mean and variance
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on input size for maximum occupancy
// Consider using a smaller datatype if precision requirements permit (e.g., half precision)
