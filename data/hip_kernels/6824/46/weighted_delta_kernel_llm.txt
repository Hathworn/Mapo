```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for arrays to enhance performance.
// Minimize the use of conditional branches within the stride loop.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to achieve optimal memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce latency if data reuse within the block is possible.
```
