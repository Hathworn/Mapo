```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Use texture memory for reading image values to leverage caching.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory.
// Avoid bank conflicts by proper alignment of shared memory access.
// Unroll loops to reduce instruction overhead within critical sections.
