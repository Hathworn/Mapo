```
// Consider using shared memory to cache sub-matrix tiles and reduce global memory accesses.
// Loop unrolling can be applied to the innermost loop to potentially increase data throughput.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a linear, contiguous access pattern.
// Consider using __syncthreads() for synchronizing threads when using shared memory.
