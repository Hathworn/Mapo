```
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced access
// Minimize global memory accesses by reading shared data once
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for re-use
// Consider unrolling the inner loops for better performance
// Reduce the use of __syncthreads() by restructuring computations
// Ensure gradInput_data is aligned for optimal performance
// Consider using float4 or float2 for vectorized memory operations
