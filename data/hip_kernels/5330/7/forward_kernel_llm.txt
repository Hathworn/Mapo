// Consider coalesced memory access for better global memory access efficiency.
// Explore the use of shared memory to store mean and variance for faster access.
// Check for potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Utilize vectorized loads and stores if applicable to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure the kernel is operating on enough work items to fully utilize the GPU.
// Investigate warp divergence and optimize thread paths to minimize it.
// Consider loop unrolling if the number of iterations is fixed for performance gains.
