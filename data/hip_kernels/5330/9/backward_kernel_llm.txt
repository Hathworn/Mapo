```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing `dz`, `z`, `dx` with contiguous threads.
// Use shared memory to cache variables that are repeatedly used like `edz`, `eydz`.
// Consider reducing global memory transactions by combining multiple operations if possible.
// Use `__syncthreads()` if necessary when accessing data that might have race conditions.
// Minimize the use of branching in kernel code to improve warp execution efficiency.
