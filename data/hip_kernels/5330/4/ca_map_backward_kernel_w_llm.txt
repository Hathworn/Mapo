```c
// Consider using shared memory for 'dout' and 'g' to reduce global memory accesses.
// Unroll the inner loop over 'plane' to improve instruction throughput.
// Optimize the memory access pattern for 'dout' and 'g' for better cache efficiency.
// Analyze if atomic operations can be reduced or eliminated to minimize serialization.
