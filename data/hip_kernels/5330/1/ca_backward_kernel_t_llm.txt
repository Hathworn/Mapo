```
// Optimize memory access by favoring coalesced reads/writes
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Combine loop indices for efficient memory access patterns
// Minimize divergence by simplifying conditional statements
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for float operations
