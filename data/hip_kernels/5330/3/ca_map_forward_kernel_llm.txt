// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure loop indexing allows for coalesced memory access of g and weight arrays
// Try loop unrolling for the innermost loops to enhance performance
// Consider using float4 or similar for vectorized memory access with g and weight
// Optimize conditional checks to minimize divergence in thread execution
// Align data structures to 128 bytes for optimal memory transactions
