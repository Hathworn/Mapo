```
// Consider using shared memory to cache common data and reduce global memory accesses
// Explore loop unrolling to enhance ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Implement double buffering to overlap computation and memory access
// Analyze vectorized loads/stores to improve memory throughput
// Investigate using warp-level primitives to optimize reduction within threads
