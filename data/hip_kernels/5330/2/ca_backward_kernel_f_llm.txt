```
// Consider using a wider blockDim for better memory coalescing
// Use shared memory to store dw and t values for each thread block
// Pre-fetch data into registers for reduced global memory access latency
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce redundant global memory reads
// Optimize the use of atomicAdd by reorganizing memory access patterns
