```
// Consider memory coalescing for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data access patterns
// Explore shared memory usage for repetitive access of gradOutput_data[ipidx]
// Evaluate loop unrolling effectiveness in terms of memory access latency reduction
// Investigate possible warp divergence due to conditional loops within kernel
// Verify alignment of data structures with respect to memory transaction size
