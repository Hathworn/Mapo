```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth.
// Minimize thread divergence within the kernel for better efficiency.
// Balance the workload evenly among threads to improve performance.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data.
