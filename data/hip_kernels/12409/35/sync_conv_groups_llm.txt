```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Check if coalesced memory access patterns can be applied for better performance.
// Utilize vectorized loads/stores if applicable for higher throughput.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring memory accesses stride is not a multiple of shared memory banks.
// If applicable, use constant memory for values that remain unchanged throughout the kernel execution.
// Assess the occupancy of the kernel and optimize the block size to maximize it.
// Ensure kernel uses enough threads to keep all cores busy for maximizing performance.
