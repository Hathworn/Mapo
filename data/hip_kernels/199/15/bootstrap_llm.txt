// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to maximize coalesced memory accesses.
// Precompute constants outside the loop to minimize repetitive computation.
// Analyze the usage of shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Evaluate the benefit of using registers for variables that do not need to persist across kernel calls.
// Examine the possibility of loop unrolling for the iteration over bins to increase instruction-level parallelism.
