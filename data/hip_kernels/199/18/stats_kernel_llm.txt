```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access, minimizing latency and improving throughput.
// Optimize loop by unrolling it to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Use shared memory for partial sums to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Perform parallel reduction within block using shared memory to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Write reduced results to global memory only once to minimize global memory writes.
