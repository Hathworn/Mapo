```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput and bandwidth utilization.
// Explore occupancy and ensure high utilization of execution units by launching sufficient threads.
// Minimize register usage per thread to avoid limiting the number of active threads per multiprocessor.
// Align data structures to natural boundaries to leverage hardware capabilities for efficient memory transactions.
