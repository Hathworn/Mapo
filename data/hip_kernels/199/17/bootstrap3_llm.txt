```
// Use registers for frequently used variables to reduce global memory access time
// Initialize myResample to 0.0 to prevent using garbage value
// Loop unrolling if it's known that 'bins' won't change frequently
// Improved access pattern for g_irand[id * bins + i] / constant
// Write final result to global memory with computed index
