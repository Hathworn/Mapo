```
// Use shared memory to cache d_FIR_input values for each warp and reduce global memory access
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns in d_SNR_output and d_SNR_taps for better performance
// Optimize the access to d_MSD[0] and d_MSD[1] by using register variables if possible
// Unroll the loop to decrease loop overhead and improve performance
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access to further enhance memory access efficiency
// Leverage warp shuffling to share values between threads without additional shared memory usage
