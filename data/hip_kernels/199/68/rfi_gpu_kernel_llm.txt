// Consider memory coalescing; ensure contiguous memory access for better bandwidth utilization
// Explore the use of shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Evaluate potential benefits of utilizing vectorized data types for memory access
// Assess load balance between threads; ensure even workload distribution
// Investigate the potential trade-off between precision and performance for variable types
