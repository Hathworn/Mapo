```
// Consider replacing global memory access with shared memory where appropriate to reduce latency.
// Minimize the use of division operations; precompute as much as possible outside of loops.
// Use local variables for intermediate computations to reduce global memory access.
// Consider optimizing random number generation to ensure it is fast and efficient.
// Reduce access conflicts in g_idata by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Ensure that g_odata writes are coalesced to improve memory write performance.
