// Consider using shared memory caching for d_input to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize the memory access pattern by using coalesced access when reading from d_input.
// Investigate the usage of atomic operations for accumulating sums to potentially improve performance.
// Consider unrolling the loop over nsamp to reduce loop overhead.
