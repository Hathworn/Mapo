```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Align memory access to ensure coalesced reads and writes for increased memory throughput.
// Use constant memory for frequently read data that does not change over the runtime to speed up access.
// Reduce divergent branches by restructuring conditions to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory to avoid serialization of memory accesses.
