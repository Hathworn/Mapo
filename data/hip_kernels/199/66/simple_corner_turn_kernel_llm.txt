```
// Consider aligning data structures to improve memory access
// Evaluate the necessity of shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by optimizing thread and data mapping
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
// Consider using asynchronous data transfer if host-device communication is a bottleneck
