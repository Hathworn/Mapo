```c
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to coalesce global memory accesses
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure memory access patterns lead to minimal bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for increased throughput in memory-bound sections
// Optimize the FIR calculation loop to improve arithmetic intensity
// Evaluate and possibly reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls for performance
// Ensure optimal block and grid sizing for maximum occupancy
