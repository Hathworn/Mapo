```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Consider moving inv_norm calculation outside the loop if norm is constant
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if overlapping data is processed by multiple threads
// Avoid branching by using arithmetic operations in places of if conditions where possible
