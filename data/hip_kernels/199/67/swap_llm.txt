// Use __ldg intrinsic for read-only cache optimization on d_output to reduce global memory bandwidth consumption.
// Consider using shared memory to store portions of d_input and d_output to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses in a way that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
