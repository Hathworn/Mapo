```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_input and d_output.
// Use memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Ensure enough threads are used to hide memory latency with where __syncthreads() is placed.
// Try optimizing y_r and x_r to reduce redundant calculations within loops.
// Potentially adjust block and grid dimensions based on the problem size for optimal occupancy.
