```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to load blocks of data if applicable to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling if the computation allows to minimize loop overhead.
// Ensure alignment of data allocations to improve access speed.
// Minimize use of unnecessary branching within the kernel to enhance performance.
