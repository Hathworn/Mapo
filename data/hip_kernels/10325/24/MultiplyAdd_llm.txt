```
// Consider using shared memory for d_ConstantA and d_ConstantB loads to reduce global memory accesses
// Evaluate if texture memory is suitable for read-only data like d_Data to reduce bandwidth usage
// If global memory access patterns align, consider coalescing loads and stores to improve memory throughput
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy and maximize parallel execution
// Investigate warp divergence and ensure minimal branching for better performance
