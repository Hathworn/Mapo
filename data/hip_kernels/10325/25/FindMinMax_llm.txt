```
// Use coalesced access for d_Data to improve memory throughput
// Consider using float2 for combined min and max operations
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing bank conflicts
// Ensure __syncthreads() is positioned correctly to avoid race conditions
// Evaluate if further loop unrolling could yield performance benefits
// Assess if multiple kernel launches affect performance negatively
