```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for g_Data by utilizing coalesced access and avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Review the data loading strategy and check if prefetching can improve memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate if the Gaussian weights calculation can be moved to host-side preprocessing to save on computation per thread.
// Inspect atomicAdd usage for potential performance benefits from non-atomic operations or other synchronization methods.
// Analyze the histogram update strategy and explore parallel reduction techniques to improve throughput.
// Investigate if the current block-wise histogram addition benefits from shared memory optimizations.
// Examine if smoothing histograms can be effectively parallelized or optimized further.
// Consider using atomic operations like atomicMax for locating orientation peaks to enhance parallelism and reduce race conditions.
