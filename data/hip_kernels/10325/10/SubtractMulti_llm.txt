// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if used
// Align data to improve memory access speed
// Ensure adequate occupancy for better performance
