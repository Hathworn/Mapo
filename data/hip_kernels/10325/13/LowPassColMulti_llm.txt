// Consider coalesced memory access for d_Data and d_Result to improve performance
// Use vectorized loads if possible for d_Data to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Minimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts or consider padding
// Consider loop unrolling for finer granularity in convolution calculations
// Ensure proper alignment for kernel accesses to enhance memory access speeds
