```c
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning d_Data1, d_Data2, and d_Data3 with the warp size.
// Use __mul24 for efficient multiplication on older architectures but consider using operator * for newer GPUs.
// Use conditional compilation to handle differences between architectures (e.g., warp size changes).
// Consider using texture memory if d_Data1, d_Data2, and d_Data3 are read-only and exhibit spatial locality.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring optimal data alignment and adjustments.
// Reduce shared memory usage if possible or use dynamic shared memory allocation for flexibility.
// Use loop unrolling techniques if the performance gain outweighs increased register pressure.
// Try to reduce __syncthreads() usage to minimize synchronization overhead but ensure data consistency.
// Efficiently use registers to decrease unnecessary spilling to global memory.
