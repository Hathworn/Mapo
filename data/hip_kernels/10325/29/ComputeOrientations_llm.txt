```cpp
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency.
// Consider rearranging memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads.
// Explore the possibility of prefetching data to hide memory access latencies.
// Optimize Gaussian weight calculations by precomputing constants.
// Ensure histogram reduction is efficient by reducing bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Apply loop unrolling strategies where applicable to reduce overhead.
// Evaluate parallel reduction techniques to speed up histogram accumulation.
