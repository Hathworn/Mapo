// Consider optimizing the use of shared memory by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Increase data-prefetching efficiency by loading data in larger chunks.
// Apply loop unrolling techniques to iterations where appropriate.
// Enhance coalesced memory access patterns for global memory.
// Optimize memory access by aligning access patterns to warp boundaries.
