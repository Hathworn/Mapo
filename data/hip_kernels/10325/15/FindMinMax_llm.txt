```c
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Consider using float2 for loading and storing two values at once
// Align shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts
// Minimize global memory writes by reducing results within shared memory
// Optimize synchronization to reduce idle threads
```
