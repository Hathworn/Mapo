// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions by loading input data once
// Check if loop unrolling matches the hardware capabilities for better performance
// Align shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts and improve access speed
// Evaluate the thread block size and grid configuration for optimal performance
