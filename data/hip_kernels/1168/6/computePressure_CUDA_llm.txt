```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling for the index calculation offers any performance benefit
// Investigate if pre-fetching data can help in hiding memory latency
// Explore memory coalescing techniques for optimal global memory access patterns
// Analyze if using texture memory or other fast memory spaces can accelerate the density access
