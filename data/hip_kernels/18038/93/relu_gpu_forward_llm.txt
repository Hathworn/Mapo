// Consider aligning data on memory boundaries for coalesced access.
// Use shared memory if there's repeated access to the same data.
// Explore increasing warp occupancy to reduce idle threads and enhance utilization.
// Implement additional loop unrolling for deeper pipelining and reduced branch divergence.
