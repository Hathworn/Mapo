```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring aligned memory access for all pointers
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory reads
// Minimize divergent branches by preventing execution path variation among threads
// Explore utilizing vectorized operations for improved throughput
// Adjust block size based on the hardware capabilities to maximize usage
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth
