// Use dynamic shared memory allocation to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loop to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead
// Use shared memory for partial sum aggregation to minimize global memory writes
// Implement loop unrolling in inner loop to reduce loop control overhead
// Use reduction for sum aggregation with shared memory to improve memory efficiency
// Atomic operation for updating scale_updates to ensure correct parallel updates
