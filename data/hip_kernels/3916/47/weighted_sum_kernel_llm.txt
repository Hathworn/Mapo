// Consider using shared memory to cache data for a and b to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and performance.
// Ensure grid-stride loops cover all data elements for comprehensive processing.
