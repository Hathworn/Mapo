// Consider using shared memory for mean and variance to reduce global memory access
// Re-check block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and minimizing latency
// Evaluate the loop unrolling techniques to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Experiment with different memory banks to reduce possible conflicts
// Consider data prefetching strategies to hide memory latency
