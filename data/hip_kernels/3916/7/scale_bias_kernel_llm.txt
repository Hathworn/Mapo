```
// Coalesce memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring warp-level uniformity
// Use shared memory for bias values if accessed repeatedly by threads within the same block
// Consider increasing the thread block size for better occupancy and efficiency
// Align data structures to enable vectorized memory access when possible
