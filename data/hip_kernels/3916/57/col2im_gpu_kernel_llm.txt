```
// Use shared memory to handle frequently accessed elements to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for data_col to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to improve performance.
// Investigate using texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of caching benefits.
// Optimize the loop bounds to enable further compiler optimizations.
