```
// Consider using `__restrict__` qualifier for input pointers to improve compiler optimization
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting data layout if possible
// Use `__ldg` for all read-only global memory accesses to leverage texture cache
