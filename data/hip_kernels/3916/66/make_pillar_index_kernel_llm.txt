```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when reading from dev_pillar_count_histo to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory for dev_pillar_count_histo if there are repeated accesses
// Avoid warp divergence by checking boundary conditions and early exits uniformly across threads
// Employ loop unrolling techniques if applicable for accessing dev_sparse_pillar_map
// Optimize atomic operations where possible to reduce contention and improve performance
