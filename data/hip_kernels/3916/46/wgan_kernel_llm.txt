// Consider coalesced memory access for pred, truth, delta, and error arrays.
// Leverage shared memory where applicable to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use larger block size to increase the ratio of computations to memory operations.
// Minimize condition checks inside the loop for better performance.
// Analyze and optimize thread divergence to ensure efficient execution.
