```
// Use coalesced memory access for the `delta` array when possible
// Potentially use shared memory to store data locally and reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure the data is appropriately prefetched to hide latency
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Optimize calculations by minimizing the use of expensive operations like division and sqrt
