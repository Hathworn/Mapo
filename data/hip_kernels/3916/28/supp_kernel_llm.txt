```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Reduce global memory accesses by using shared memory if possible
// Use warp-level primitives for better performance and memory access
// Ensure INCX is 1 to enable effective memory coalescing
// Consider using texture or cache memory for repeated data access
// Tune block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and performance
