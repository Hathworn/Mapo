```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.
// Consider reading pred and truth values into registers to minimize latency.
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to improve performance when n is large.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further optimize reduction operations within a warp.
