```cpp
// Unroll the loop for improved performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning input and output data
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Utilize shared memory to cache intermediate results if possible
// Consider using float4/float2 for vectorized memory operations to reduce transaction count
// Reduce redundant calculations and memory accesses in the softmax_device function
```
