```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring aligned memory operations for 'x' and 'out'
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is high in block scope to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'x' and 'out' in the global memory
// Minimize usage of atomic operations or explore atomic intrinsics for increased efficiency
// Explore loop unrolling strategies if applicable to reduce branching overhead in the kernel
// Investigate potential use of texture memory or read-only data caches for 'x' if applicable
