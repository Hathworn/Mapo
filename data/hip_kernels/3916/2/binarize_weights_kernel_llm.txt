```
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_down() for efficient reduction
// Ensure proper initialization of shared memory to avoid undefined behavior
// Analyze memory access patterns to improve coalesced accesses for both weights and binary arrays
// Optimize the atomicAdd operation possibly using warp reduction strategies
// Investigate the potential for using float2 or float4 data types for improved memory throughput
