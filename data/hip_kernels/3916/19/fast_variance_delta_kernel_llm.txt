```c
// Consider using coalesced memory access optimizing `delta` and `x`.
// Use shared memory effectively by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Ensure full occupancy by adjusting block size and calculation to fit target GPU architecture.
// If applicable, tune the number of threads per block according to spatial dimensions.
