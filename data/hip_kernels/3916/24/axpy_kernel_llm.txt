```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for both X and Y arrays
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse across threads is high
// Optimize thread block size based on the specific GPU architecture
// Experiment with loop unrolling to enhance performance
// Ensure that INCX and INCY do not lead to bank conflicts
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching if applicable
