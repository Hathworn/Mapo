```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by arranging data layout
// Use shared memory to store biases if they are reused frequently
// Consider using float4 for vectorized memory access
// Optimize loop unrolling further for specific architectures
// Minimize divergence by aligning index calculations
// Explore occupancy optimization for better thread distribution
