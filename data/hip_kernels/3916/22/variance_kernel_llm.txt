```
// Consider using shared memory to store mean and reduce global memory access
// Ensure proper alignment of memory accesses for better coalescing
// Optimize loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance
// Utilize vectorized loads if architecture supports it for higher throughput
// Consider increasing block size if occupancy is not at its maximum
// Explore using asynchronous memory copies for mean if appropriate
