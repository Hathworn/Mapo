// Consider preferring memory coalescing for global memory access
// Attempt to minimize global memory access latency
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory traffic
// Implement loop unrolling for enhanced performance
// Leverage shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Use atomic operations to lower synchronization overhead
