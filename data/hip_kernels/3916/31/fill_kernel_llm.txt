```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to minimize global memory latency
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses, if applicable
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure efficient utilization of resources
// Leverage vectorized memory operations if supported by the hardware
// Optimize memory access patterns to align with warp boundaries
