```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling for the spatial dimension to enhance pipeline efficiency
// Allocate shared memory dynamically if spatial size is not fixed
// Ensure shared memory usage is within optimal limits for the target GPU architecture
// Utilize __builtin_assume_aligned to enable more effective compiler optimizations
// Experiment with larger block sizes to increase occupancy and maximize parallelism
