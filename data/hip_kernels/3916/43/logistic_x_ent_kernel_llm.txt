```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads and data structures.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if necessary.
// Consider using loop unrolling for potential performance improvements.
// Check for occupancy limits to ensure GPU resources are fully utilized.
