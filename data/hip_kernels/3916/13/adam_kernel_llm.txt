```c
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory accesses for x, m, v
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables like invB1t and invB2t
// Use local variables for calculations to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize the use of powf for better performance by reusing already computed values
```
