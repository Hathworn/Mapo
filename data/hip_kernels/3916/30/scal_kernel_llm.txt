// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to improve memory access optimizations
// Ensure coalesced memory access by verifying INCX equals 1
// Consider using shared memory for caching data if the operation involves multiple accesses
// Evaluate the impact of adjusting blockDim and gridDim for optimal occupancy and memory throughput
