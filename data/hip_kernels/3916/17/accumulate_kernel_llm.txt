```
// Use shared memory to cache data if multiple threads access the same elements
// Coalesce memory accesses where possible for better memory throughput
// Ensure blocks and threads are chosen to minimize bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of loop control
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to improve access efficiency
