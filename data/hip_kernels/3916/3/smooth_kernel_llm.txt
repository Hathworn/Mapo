```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve cache utilization
// Perform loop unrolling for better memory coalescing and execution efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern by aligning memory accesses with thread block size
// Use constant memory for any read-only data to reduce global memory loads
