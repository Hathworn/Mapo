```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as 'mean' and 'variance' to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize loop iteration by employing loop unrolling for the inner 'spatial' loop.
// Use texture memory for read-only data like 'variance' to leverage faster memory access.
