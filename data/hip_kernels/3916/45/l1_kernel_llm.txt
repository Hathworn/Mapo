```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for pred and truth arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if access patterns show temporal locality.
// Minimize dynamic shared memory usage to prevent limiting the number of active warps on the multiprocessor.
// Optimize data alignment to enable efficient use of vectorized memory operations if applicable.
