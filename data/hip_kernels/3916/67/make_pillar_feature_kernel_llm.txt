```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch data to improve memory access patterns and latency hiding
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data structures to match warp execution
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed size loops to reduce loop overhead
// Use warp-level primitives to handle independent tasks more efficiently
