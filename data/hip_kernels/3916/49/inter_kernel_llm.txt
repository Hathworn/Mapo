```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for X and Y.
// Perform loop unrolling if constants NX, NY, and B are known at compile time for potential performance improvement.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for variables and arrays accessed in global memory.
// Evaluate the potential for using half precision if applicable to decrease memory bandwidth usage.
