```c
// Use coalesced memory access by optimizing input and output index calculations.
// Ensure the memory access pattern is continuous to improve cache efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve throughput.
// Reduce divergent branches by simplifying the conditional operations.
```
