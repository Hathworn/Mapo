// Precompute indices outside of the inner loop to reduce computation
// Use shared memory if possible to cache x_coors, y_coors for frequent accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for pfe_output and scattered_feature
// Check for alignment of data structures to optimize memory access
// Minimize divergence in thread execution within warp
