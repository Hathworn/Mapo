// Consider using shared memory to cache x values for improved memory access patterns.
// Optimize thread block size to ensure enough active threads for efficient execution.
// Ensure memory accesses in the loop are coalesced for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve performance.
