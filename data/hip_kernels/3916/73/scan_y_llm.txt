```cpp
// Use cooperative loading to maximize shared memory usage
// Improve the memory coalescing by accessing consecutive elements
// Maintain warp efficiency by synchronizing all threads after memory operations
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Clear last element for correct scan operation
// Minimize synchronization points to enhance performance
// Improve index calculation for global memory storage
// Ensure memory writes back to global memory after processing
// Use ternary for clearer logic and potential reduction in branching
