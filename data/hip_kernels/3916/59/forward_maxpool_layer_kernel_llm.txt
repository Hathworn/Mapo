```
// Align memory accesses to improve cache efficiency
// Minimize redundant calculations, precompute invariant expressions where possible
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for commonly used data
// Optimize the loop order to ensure sequential memory access patterns
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores to increase memory throughput
// Apply loop unrolling techniques for critical sections to reduce loop overhead
