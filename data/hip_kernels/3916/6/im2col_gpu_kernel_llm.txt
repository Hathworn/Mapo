```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for data_im
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by padding shared memory if necessary
// Balance the load across threads to maximize occupancy
// Use warp size calculations for thread indexing to optimize performance
