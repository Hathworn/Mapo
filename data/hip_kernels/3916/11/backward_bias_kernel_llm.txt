```
// Unroll inner loop to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Check and optimize memory alignment to minimize cache misses
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Perform parallel reduction with shared memory to enhance performance
// Use atomicAdd for safe concurrent updates of global variables
