```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations in `a`, `b`, `s`, `da`, `db`, `ds`, and `dc`.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate loop unrolling or other techniques to reduce loop control overhead if applicable.
// Minimize use of conditional statements within the kernel loop for improved performance.
