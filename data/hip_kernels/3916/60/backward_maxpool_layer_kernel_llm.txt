```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for delta and prev_delta arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase memory bandwidth
// Implement loop unrolling for larger loops to minimize conditional checks
// Align memory access for delta and prev_delta to improve performance
// Use atomic operations if necessary to handle concurrent writes to prev_delta
