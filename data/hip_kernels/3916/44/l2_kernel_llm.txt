```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous threads accessing contiguous memory addresses.
// Utilize shared memory if accessing elements more than once within a block.
// Consider using half precision floats if error tolerance and device support permit, to reduce memory load.
// Balance the number of threads per block and number of blocks to fully utilize the GPU cores and achieve maximum occupancy.
