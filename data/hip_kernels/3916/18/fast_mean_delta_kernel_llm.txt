```
// Unroll loops to enhance performance and improve memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses.
// Perform boundary checks within loops to prevent invalid memory accesses.
// Use thread synchronization (e.g., __syncthreads) efficiently to ensure data integrity.
// Accumulate partial results in shared memory before final reduction to minimize global memory transactions.
// Implement parallel reduction efficiently, where the intermediate results are computed in shared memory before a final write to global memory.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory segments when possible.
