```
// Consider using atomic operations for writing partial block sums to global memory to avoid race conditions.
// Adjust block size to be a multiple of warp size for better memory access coalescing.
// Ensure memory access pattern aligns for coalesced access in shared memory.
// Reduce conditional operations within the loop for faster execution.
