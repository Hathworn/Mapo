```
// Use shared memory to reduce memory access latency and improve efficiency
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for coalescing
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in shared memory
// Minimize synchronization overhead by efficient reduction within shared memory
// Consider optimizing stride access to avoid unnecessary boundary checks
