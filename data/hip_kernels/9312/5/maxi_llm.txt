```
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to avoid performance overhead
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput
// Ensure all loads/stores are coalesced for better memory performance
// Use warp-level primitives if supported to avoid expensive __syncthreads()
// Optimize data transfer by minimizing global memory accesses
```
