```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loop to improve performance by increasing instruction-level parallelism
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Use parallel reduction within a block to optimize performance
// Ensure all threads reach the barrier before reducing within the block to maintain data integrity
// Use warp shuffle operations to further optimize reduction in the last warp
