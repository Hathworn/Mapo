// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for kx and ky arrays.
// Investigate the use of shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block.
// Ensure that the memory access patterns are aligned to achieve better caching efficiency.
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for faster computation.
// Assess the alignment of memory access to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
