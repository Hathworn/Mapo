```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branching by re-evaluating condition checks
// Align data allocations to improve memory access efficiency
// Use memory transactions more effectively by ensuring contiguous access
