```
// Reduce global memory accesses by using shared memory if data can be reused by multiple threads.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations across threads.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel.
// Consider loop unrolling for small fixed-size loops if applicable.
// Assess whether more complex prefetching strategies could enhance performance.
