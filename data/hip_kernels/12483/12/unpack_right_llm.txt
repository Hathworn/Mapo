```
// Use coalesced memory access for reading buffer to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure memory alignment for buffer to leverage vectorized loads if possible.
// Apply loop unrolling for the gid loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Minimize register usage by considering compiler flags or pragmas.
// Use shared memory for buffer if possible to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider using asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation with data movement.
