```
// Use __ldg to load buffer into cache
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for field and buffer
// Assess impact of using shared memory if applicable
// Verify alignment of memory accesses for optimal performance
// Measure thread block size to maximize occupancy
// Analyze possible warp divergence within the kernel
// Evaluate benefit of loop unrolling if any loops are present
