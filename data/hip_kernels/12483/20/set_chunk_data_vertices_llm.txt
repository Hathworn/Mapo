```c
// Consider preloading shared memory with reused inputs outside thread loop.
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory for x_min and y_min.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have updated shared memory values.
// Move vertex_dx and vertex_dy writes outside of conditional blocks.
