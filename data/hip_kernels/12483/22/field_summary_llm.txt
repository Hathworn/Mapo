```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for the volume, density, energy0, and u arrays
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Consider unrolling loops further for better performance
// Minimize register usage by sharing data among threads where possible
// Ensure appropriate synchronization to avoid data hazards
```
