```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns for vertex_x and vertex_y arrays
// Optimize block size to improve warp efficiency and reduce idle threads
// Implement loop unrolling techniques in the main kernel loop to minimize branching
// Consider using vectorized operations for cell_x and cell_y calculations for better performance
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the number of temporary variables
// Ensure memory alignment for better access speeds in global memory operations
