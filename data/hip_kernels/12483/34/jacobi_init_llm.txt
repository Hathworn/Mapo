// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed density values to reduce global memory reads.
// Optimize thread/block allocation to ensure efficient memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider memory coalescing while accessing density and energy arrays.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory when implementing shared memory optimization.
// Minimize divergent branches, especially in logic depending on `coefficient`.
