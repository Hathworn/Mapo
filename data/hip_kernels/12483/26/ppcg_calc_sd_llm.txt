```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to sd and r for improved performance
// Use shared memory if there is data reuse within a block to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize the use of division and modulo operations as they are computationally expensive
// Ensure enough threads are launched to fully utilize the GPU and hide memory latency
