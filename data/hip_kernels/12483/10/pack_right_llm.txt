```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning memory patterns
// Optimize buffer access to avoid bank conflicts
// Check if using shared memory can reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure that all threads within a warp access consecutive memory addresses
// Minimize conditional checks in the kernel
