```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Try coalescing memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency.
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency.
