```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize global memory access by coalescing reads/writes
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for cache utilization
// Evaluate the impact of increasing block size for better GPU utilization
// Profile memory transactions to avoid bank conflicts
