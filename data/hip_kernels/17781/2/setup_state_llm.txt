```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by indexing state array with id calculated using block and thread indices.
// Optimize memory access patterns by setting block dimensions to be a multiple of the warp size.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads in the same block require access to the same data.
// Minimize use of global memory within kernel to reduce latency.
