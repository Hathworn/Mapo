```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced accesses for u, v, and src arrays
// Consider pre-fetching values into shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Utilize __syncthreads() to coordinate shared memory usage if implemented
// Minimize the use of atomic operations where possible to reduce contention
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives to optimize reductions
// Ensure that normalization_factor updates are done efficiently with minimal atomic overhead
// Evaluate aligning memory accesses with warp boundaries for better performance
