```
// Use shared memory to cache flow and src values to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads access continuous chunks of memory.
// Consider loop unrolling for potential performance gain in critical loops.
// Evaluate the effectiveness of different atomic operations to optimize performance.
// Utilize vectorized data types for better throughput where applicable.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy based on the target GPU architecture.
// Profile and adjust memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts.
