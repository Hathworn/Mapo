```
// Consider aligning data access to leverage global memory coalescing.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible.
// Optimize thread block size to match the hardware's warp size for efficiency.
// Analyze memory access patterns to minimize memory latency.
// Ensure that there is no bank conflict in shared memory usage.
// Investigate if computation to memory access ratio can be improved.
