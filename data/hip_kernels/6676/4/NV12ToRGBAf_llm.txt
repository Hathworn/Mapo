```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access and speed up memory transactions.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Implement loop unrolling where applicable to reduce the overhead of loop control.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory for efficient parallel access.
// Employ more efficient interpolation using hardware intrinsics if available.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for potentially faster data access.
