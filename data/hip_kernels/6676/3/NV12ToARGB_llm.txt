```
// Optimize memory access by using __ldg() for read-only source image data to leverage L1 cache.
// Use shared memory for storing intermediate chroma values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using texture memory for 2D spatial locality and automatic data caching.
// Align processingPitch to a multiple of 32 to improve coalesced memory accesses.
// Reduce divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Increase threads per block to a multiple of 32 for better utilization of the GPU cores.
