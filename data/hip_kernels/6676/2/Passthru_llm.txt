```
// Change data types from uint32_t to uint8_t for srcImage to save memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to store srcImage data for the threads to reduce global memory access
// Unroll loops if any to increase parallelism and reduce overhead
// Explore use of texture or surface memory to take advantage of hardware caching for srcImage
