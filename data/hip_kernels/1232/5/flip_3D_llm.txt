```
// Remove __syncthreads(); as each branch works on disjoint data
// Consider optimizing memory accesses by aligning data fetches
// Explore using shared memory to improve data locality for each thread block
// Evaluate coalescing memory accesses to minimize latency
// Investigate loop unrolling for operations on small arrays for better performance
// Analyze the possibility of using atomic operations if write conflicts occur
