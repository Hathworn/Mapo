```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by using shared memory for tiles.
// Minimize global memory accesses by pre-loading necessary elements into registers.
// Evaluate coalesced memory access patterns for random and kernel arrays for better performance.
// Exploit data locality by processing data in a manner that minimizes cache thrashing.
// Investigate warp efficiency for potential improvements in kernel execution.
