```cpp
// Precompute dim_z, dim_y, dim_x division by 2 to avoid recalculating
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing sequential coordinates in the structure
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead if applicable
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize underutilization
```
