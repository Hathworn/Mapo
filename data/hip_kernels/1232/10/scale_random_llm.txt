// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if needed
// Ensure 'total_size' is evenly divisible by the block size to avoid divergent branching
// Launch kernel with an optimal block size for better occupancy and performance
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data already loaded into registers or shared memory
