```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory access patterns for improved bandwidth utilization
// Minimize branch divergence within threads for better warp execution
// Consider launching more blocks for larger grid sizes to improve parallelism
// Align memory access to enable faster load and store operations
```
