// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved efficiency
// Reduce global memory transactions by storing intermediate results in registers
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant calculations within a block
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for optimal performance
// Minimize divergent branches wherever possible
