// Use shared memory to store old_y and old_x to reduce global memory access latency.
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Optimize thread block size to improve memory throughput and load balancing.
// Consider loop unrolling if there are repeated calculations within the loop.
