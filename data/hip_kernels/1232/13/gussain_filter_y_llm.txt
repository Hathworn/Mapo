```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache kernel data for improved memory efficiency.
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced reads from 'random' array.
// Implement loop unrolling for the for-loop iterating over 'i' to improve performance.
// Use __syncthreads() after loading data into shared memory to ensure proper synchronization.
// Consider adjusting block size to improve occupancy and memory throughput.
