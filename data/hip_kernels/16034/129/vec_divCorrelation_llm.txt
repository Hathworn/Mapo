```
// Consider using shared memory to store varImage and varPSF values for each block to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for x, varImage, and varPSF to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling or other arithmetic optimizations may improve performance in division and sqrtf operations.
