```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like amplitude 
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use warp-synchronous programming where applicable to optimize thread execution
// Minimize data transfers between host and device by processing larger batches
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to better fit the CUDA SM capabilities
