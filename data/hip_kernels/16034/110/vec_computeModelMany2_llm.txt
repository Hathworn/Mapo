```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Minimize register usage to improve occupancy
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data (e.g., amplitude[id2], background[id2])
// Optimize loop unrolling for the for-loop to reduce overhead
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by structuring conditional logic effectively
// Validate that memory access patterns are optimized for L2 cache utilization
```
