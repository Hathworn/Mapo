```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse occurs within a block
// Optimize grid and block dimensions according to the problem size and architecture
// Minimize divergent code for better warp execution efficiency
// Measure the performance and occupancy to identify further optimization points
```
