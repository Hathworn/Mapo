```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory accesses
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within a block is present
// Evaluate the occupancy to ensure maximum resource utilization
// Use __restrict__ pointers if there are no pointer aliasing concerns
// Check for potential use of vectorized instructions for erfc calculations
