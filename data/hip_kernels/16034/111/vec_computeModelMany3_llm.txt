```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory if there are common data elements reused among threads
// Consider coalescing memory access for 'x', 'amplitude', and 'background' arrays for improved performance
// Ensure result array writes are coalesced for better memory throughput
// Prefetch data when possible to hide memory latency
