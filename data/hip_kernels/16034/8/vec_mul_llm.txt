// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses by optimizing data alignment
// Consider using a larger block size for increased parallelism
// Check and balance occupancy to improve utilization
// Reduce divergent branches within warp
// Use const restrict qualifiers for pointers if applicable
