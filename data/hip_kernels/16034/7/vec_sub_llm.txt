```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for x, y, and result arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store chunks of x and y if frequent reuse within a block is needed.
// Ensure data alignment for x, y, and result arrays to minimize misaligned accesses.
// Minimize the use of global memory by using registers for temporary variables when possible.
// Assess the occupancy and optimize block and grid dimensions for better efficiency.
