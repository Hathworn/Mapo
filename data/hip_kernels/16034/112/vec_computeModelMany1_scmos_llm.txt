```
// Consider using shared memory for scmos array if accessed multiple times to reduce global memory access.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to potentially improve memory access speed by preventing aliasing.
// Align data in memory where possible to improve access speed and cache efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to reduce global memory access latency.
