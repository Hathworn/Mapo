```
// Combine memory accesses where possible to improve coalescing
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where appropriate
// Precompute repetitive terms outside of the kernel loop
// Consider the use of register variables for frequently accessed data
// Look into reducing divergence by aligning work with warp boundaries
