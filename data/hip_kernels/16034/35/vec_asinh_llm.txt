```
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a contiguous manner
// Consider loop unrolling to improve throughput if applicable
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring conditions are uniformly true or false for thread warps
// Profile the kernel to identify bottlenecks and focus optimization efforts there
