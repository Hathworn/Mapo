```
// Consider using shared memory for the kernel array to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize register usage by optimizing math operations for better occupancy.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data if possible.
// Evaluate whether using a 2D thread block can improve performance depending on the data distribution.
// Check if loop unrolling would benefit performance in scenarios with predictable loops.
