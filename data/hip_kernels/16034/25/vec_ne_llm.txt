// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays x and y to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory if the input arrays x and y have reuse to reduce global memory traffic.
// Explore using vectorized loads/stores if the hardware supports them for better memory throughput.
// Assess the grid and block size to ensure optimal occupancy and balance between computation and memory access.
