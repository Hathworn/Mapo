```
// Use shared memory for repeated data access if multiple threads access overlapping regions of x
// Coalesce global memory accesses to x and result arrays for improved memory bandwidth
// Align memory allocations to 128 bytes to ensure efficient memory transactions
// Consider loop unrolling techniques if more operations are done within the if statement
// Employ memory prefetching to hide memory latency if applicable
