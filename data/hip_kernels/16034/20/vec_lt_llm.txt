// Consider coalesced memory access to improve throughput
// Ensure alignment of data types to prevent misaligned access
// Evaluate usage of shared memory if working set fits in shared memory space
// Check if loop unrolling would benefit the performance for small n
// Avoiding warp divergence by minimizing conditional logic
