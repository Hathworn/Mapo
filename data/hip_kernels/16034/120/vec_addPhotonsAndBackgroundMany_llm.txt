```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing to improve the memory access pattern
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() if shared memory is involved
// Consider loop unrolling if the computation is iterated and benefits from it
// Check for bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Explore warp-level primitives if further optimization is needed
