```
// Combine index computation to reduce arithmetic operations
// Minimize arithmetic operations in index calculation
// Always ensure valid range check before expensive calculations
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access with memory boundaries
// Opt for shared memory or registers if repeated data access patterns are identified
