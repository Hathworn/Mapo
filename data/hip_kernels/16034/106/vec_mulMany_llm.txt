```
// Use shared memory for kernel to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize repeated access 
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for improved memory throughput 
// Align memory accesses to avoid uncoalesced access penalties
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance
