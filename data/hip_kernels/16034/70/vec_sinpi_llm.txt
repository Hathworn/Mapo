```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads need to access the same values.
// Ensure alignment for optimal memory access speed.
// Use constant memory for any read-only values referenced by all threads.
// Ensure proper occupancy by optimizing block size and grid size.
