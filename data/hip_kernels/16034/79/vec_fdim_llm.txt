```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data
// Consider using shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Use asynchronous data transfer to overlap computation and data transfer
// Minimize divergence in branch statements for better warp efficiency
// Verify that the data is laid out for optimal access pattern
