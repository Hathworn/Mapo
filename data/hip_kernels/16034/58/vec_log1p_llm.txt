```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for data reused within a block
// Consider using a memory coalescing strategy for aligned data access
// Explore asynchronous memory prefetching techniques to overlap data transfers and computation
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same path
