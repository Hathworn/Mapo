```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better performance
// Use shared memory if accessing data multiple times to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure proper data alignment for double precision to prevent inefficient memory access
// Optimize grid and block size for maximum occupancy and memory throughput
