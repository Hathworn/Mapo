```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for the `x` and `y` arrays.
// Attempt to use shared memory if `n` is small enough to fit data.
// Ensure memory alignment for `result`, `x`, and `y` to avoid uncoalesced accesses.
// Assess if using float instead of double can provide performance gains if lower precision is acceptable.
// Optimize the configuration of `blockDim.x` for better occupancy and memory throughput.
