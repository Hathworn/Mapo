```
// Coalesce memory accesses for better efficiency by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses if the data is reused within the block.
// Consider using __ldg intrinsic for read-only data to utilize texture cache.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads.
// Minimize the use of conditional statements within the kernel to prevent divergence.
