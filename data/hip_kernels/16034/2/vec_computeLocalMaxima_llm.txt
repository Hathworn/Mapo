```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for input and localMaxima arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads within inner loops
// Minimize the divergence in the control flow, especially in loops for neighbor comparison
// Implement loop unrolling to improve performance of the nested loops
// Consider using texture memory for read-only input access to take advantage of caching
