```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure threads are not underutilized
// Minimize register pressure by optimizing variable usage
// Use fast math operations if precision allows for improved performance
