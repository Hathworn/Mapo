```
// Consider aligning memory access to improve coalescing
// Use const __restrict__ pointers if applicable to enable better optimization
// Ensure shared memory usage is limited to avoid resource constraints
// Prefetch data to shared memory to optimize memory access patterns
// Consider double buffering in shared memory for overlapping computation with memory transfer
// Use warp shuffle instructions if applicable to reduce shared memory dependency
