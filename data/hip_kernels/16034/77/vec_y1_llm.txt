```cpp
//Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if recurring reads occur
//Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access for vector x
//Utilize memory prefetching techniques if applicable to improve data loading efficiency
//Evaluate code structure for potential warping and minimize thread divergence
```
