```cpp
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by accessing consecutive indices
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by aligning data properly
// Minimize use of global memory by reusing loaded values in registers
// Consider employing loop unrolling to improve performance
// Use warp synchronous programming where applicable
```
