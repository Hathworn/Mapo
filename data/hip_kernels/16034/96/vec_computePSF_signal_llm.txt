```
// Consider increasing shared memory usage for better occupancy
// Use cooperative matrix to improve memory access patterns
// Minimize division operations by using multiplication of reciprocal
// Use __ldg intrinsic for reading global memory if possible
// Balance the workload to avoid divergence in wavefronts
