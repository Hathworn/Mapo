// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in memory
// Consider using shared memory to cache photonAndBackground and scmos values
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring consistent control flow
// Optimize grid and block size for maximum occupancy and efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated operations within the kernel
