```
// Consider using shared memory for cache-friendly access patterns.
// Ensure data alignment to prevent bank conflicts.
// Minimize global memory accesses through efficient data reuse.
// Evaluate if coalescing memory access can further improve performance.
// Explore loop unrolling for potential performance gains.
// Make sure to optimize the block and thread configuration for hardware.
// Examine if using a different data type like float improves access speed.
