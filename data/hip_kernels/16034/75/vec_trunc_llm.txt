```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for the `x` array.
// Ensure that `result` array is aligned and accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Minimize the use of shared memory unless necessary for performance.
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions to match the specific GPU architecture.
// Avoid bank conflicts if shared memory is used.
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing variable use inside the kernel.
