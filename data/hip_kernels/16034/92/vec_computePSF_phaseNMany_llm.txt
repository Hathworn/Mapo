```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for kx, ky, kz, pupil, phase to improve performance.
// Utilize shared memory for common data such as kx, ky, kz to reduce global memory access latency.
// Prefetch data from global memory to shared memory as thread block level to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Explore the use of memory padding or aligning data structures to avoid bank conflicts.
// Minimize the use of division operations where possible, as they are computationally expensive.
// Investigate the potential benefits of loop unrolling for the innermost computations to increase instruction level parallelism.
