```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache data that are repeatedly accessed
// Minimize register usage by optimizing data reuse within threads
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from fft and writing to result
// Align memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for performance improvement
```
