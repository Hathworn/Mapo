```
// Use shared memory for better data reuse
// Adjust sharedFFT size as needed for specific usage
// Load data into shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Ensure correct thread synchronization after data loading
// Improve load balancing by ensuring thread indices do not exceed array bounds
```
