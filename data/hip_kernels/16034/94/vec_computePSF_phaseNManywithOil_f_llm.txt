```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data like kx, ky, kz, etc., to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use __restrict__ to indicate that pointer parameters do not alias, which can help the compiler optimize memory access patterns.
// Align the data structures in global memory to facilitate coalesced memory access and improve memory throughput.
// Use pre-fetching techniques to hide memory latency by overlapping computation with data transfer.
// Optimize the use of registers by reusing variables and reducing the number of temporary variables.
// Consider using warp-shuffle functions for inter-thread communication to avoid costly shared memory usage.
