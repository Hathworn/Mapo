```
// Unroll loop to improve memory coalescing
// Use temporary variables for repeated calculations
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Align data structures to allow coalesced global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Evaluate if using vectorized memory operations could improve data transfer throughput
