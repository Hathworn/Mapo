```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts
// Use loop unrolling as applicable to improve utilization
// Ensure coalesced memory access for fft and psffft arrays
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel
// Investigate the use of stream or async operations for overlapping computation and data transfer
