// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data from global memory to shared memory when possible
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for further performance boost
// Use appropriate grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
