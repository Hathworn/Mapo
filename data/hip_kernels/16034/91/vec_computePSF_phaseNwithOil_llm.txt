```
// Use shared memory to cache input arrays like kx, ky, etc., to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize access coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access patterns for threads
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive calculations within the kernel
// Align memory allocation for input and output arrays for optimal access
// Consider using texture memory for kx, ky, kz for faster access
// Minimize branch divergence by refactoring conditional logic
