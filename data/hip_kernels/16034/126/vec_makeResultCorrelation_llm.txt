```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Optimize thread block dimensions for better memory coalescing.
// Use const memory for frequently accessed read-only data, like variables sizeInput and sizeFullPadded.
// Ensure memory alignment for input and output arrays to improve access efficiency.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to hide global memory latency where possible.
