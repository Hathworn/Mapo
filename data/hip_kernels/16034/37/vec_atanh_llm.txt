```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Verify if using registers can help store intermediate results and reduce access latency
// Assess whether loop unrolling can improve performance by minimizing thread divergence
