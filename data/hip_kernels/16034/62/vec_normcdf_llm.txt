```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for result and y pointers for better memory access optimization
// Ensure coalesced memory access for y by checking memory alignment and stride
// Avoid using branches inside the kernel for improved warp execution efficiency
// Consider using shared memory if there are opportunities to reuse data within a block
// Minimize register pressure by reducing unnecessary variables or using vectorization
