```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning data with warp size
// Minimize divergent threads by ensuring branches are coherent
// Consider unrolling loops to increase instruction throughput if applicable
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to cache line boundaries
