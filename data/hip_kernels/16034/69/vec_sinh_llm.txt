```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput.
// Analyze if using texture memory could benefit cases with repeated reads.
// Optimize block size and grid size based on specific GPU architecture for better performance.
