// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize divergent warps by structuring control flow to ensure all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
