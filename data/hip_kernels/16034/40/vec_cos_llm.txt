```
// Consider using shared memory for x to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure result is coalesced by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Optimize block and grid sizes to match the GPU architecture for maximum utilization.
// Use __restrict__ keyword if pointers can guarantee no overlap to help the compiler optimize memory accesses.
