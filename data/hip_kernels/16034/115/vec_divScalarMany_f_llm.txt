// Optimization: Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for improved throughput
// Optimization: Prefer use of shared memory to store repetitive data (like 'div') on each block
// Optimization: Avoid divergent branches if possible for better warp execution efficiency
// Optimization: Use floating-point intrinsic functions for faster computation
