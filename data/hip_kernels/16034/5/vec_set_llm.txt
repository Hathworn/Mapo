```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory addresses
// Consider increasing block size for better latency hiding 
// Ensure enough occupancy to hide memory latency by organizing sufficient thread blocks
// Avoid branch divergence by minimizing condition checks within the kernel
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads require access to the same data
