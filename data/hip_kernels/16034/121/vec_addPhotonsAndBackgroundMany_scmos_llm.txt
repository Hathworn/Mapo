```
// Cache frequently accessed values to reduce global memory reads
// Ensure coalesced memory access to maximize warp efficiency
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring uniform conditions in the kernel
// Consider using shared memory for repeated data access within a block
// Align data structures for better memory throughput
