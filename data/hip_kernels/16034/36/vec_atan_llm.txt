```
// Consider using shared memory to store data shared among threads within a block if possible
// Analyze memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory access
// Verify if using half precision or lower precision arithmetic would suffice for performance gain
// Check for potential loop unrolling if there are iterative operations
// Aim to minimize the use of device memory by reusing thread local data where feasible
// Potentially explore using register counts to limit resource contention
