```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve performance.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal access speed.
// Use shared memory if further optimization is necessary to reduce global memory load.
// Analyze if loop unrolling could benefit the performance for larger datasets.
