// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure aligned memory access for better performance on GPU
// Minimize divergent branches within warp to maintain efficiency
// Optimize block and grid size for better occupancy and performance
