```
// Consider coalescing memory access for x and result arrays to improve memory throughput
// Check whether shared memory can be used to temporarily store data for faster access
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can enhance performance by reducing loop overhead
// Ensure memory alignment to fully utilize the hardware capabilities and reduce latency
// Optimize block size and grid size to ensure effective utilization of GPU resources
