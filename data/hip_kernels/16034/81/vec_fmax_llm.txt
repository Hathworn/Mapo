// Consider using shared memory to cache data for reuse and reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring aligned memory allocations for x, y, and result.
// Apply loop unrolling techniques for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_sync for further optimization, if applicable.
