```
//Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.
//Optimize thread-block size for better occupancy and coalesced memory access.
//Precompute repeated calculations outside the loop if the values don't change over iterations.
//Use constant memory or texture memory for precomputed constants to improve access times.
