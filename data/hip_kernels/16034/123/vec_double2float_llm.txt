// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data if possible.
// Consider using shared memory if input and output arrays can fit for faster data access.
// Evaluate using warp-level intrinsics for efficiency where applicable.
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel for better performance.
// Consider adjusting block and grid dimensions to optimize occupancy and performance.
