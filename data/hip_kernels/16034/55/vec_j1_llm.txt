```
// Consider using shared memory to store data that will be reused across threads
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for global memory reads
// Explore the use of texture memory for read-only data that benefits from cache hi rates
// Check if the use of registers can be optimized to reduce register pressure
// Evaluate whether the kernel launch configuration maximizes occupancy
