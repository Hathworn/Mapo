```cpp
// Consider using shared memory if there is data re-use among threads in the same block
// Optimize memory access by ensuring result and x are aligned to cache line sizes
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Ensure global memory access patterns are coalesced
// Use memory prefetching techniques if the GPU supports it
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable and beneficial
```
