```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for kx, ky, kz, and phase arrays
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables like dx, dy, dz
// Optimize memory access patterns and reduce bank conflicts with sparseIndexEvenDisk and sparseIndexOddDisk
// Minimize redundant calculations, especially for the phase expression
