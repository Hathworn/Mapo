```
// Use coalesced memory access for improved memory throughput.
// Ensure 'result' array is aligned to help with memory transactions.
// Consider using shared memory for frequent access data to reduce global memory reads.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to help the compiler with optimization.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
