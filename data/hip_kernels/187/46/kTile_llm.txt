```c
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for src and tgt to help the compiler with aliasing optimization
// Consider using shared memory if there are repetitive accesses to the same src data by different threads
// Ensure data alignment and coalesced memory access for src and tgt to maximize memory throughput
```
