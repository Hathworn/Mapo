```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Load d_coordarray into shared memory at the beginning for faster access.
// For larger arrays, consider tiling the grid to cache values in shared memory.
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism within loops.
// Consider merging x and y loops where feasible to minimize control overhead.
// Ensure kernel launches enough blocks to avoid idle compute units.
