```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning global memory accesses for better performance.
// Use shared memory to store repeated calculations for Gaussian values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Eliminate bank conflicts in shared memory accesses for enhanced performance.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the normalization loop to improve execution speed.
// Normalize using parallel reduction to prevent bottlenecking in serial summation.
// Ensure balanced thread blocks to avoid divergence and idle resources.
