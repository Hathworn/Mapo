```c
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate Gaussian values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is placed where necessary to avoid race conditions, especially when reading and writing shared values.
// Optimize the reduction operation for normalization by using parallel reduction techniques.
// Revisit boundary checks and ensure they minimize warp divergence by structuring them efficiently.
