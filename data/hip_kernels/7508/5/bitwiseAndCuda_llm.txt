```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns for 'in1', 'in2', and 'out' arrays.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance.
// Check alignment of 'rowSizeIn1', 'rowSizeIn2', and 'rowSizeOut' for better memory alignment and access efficiency.
// Ensure that the launch configuration (block and grid sizes) is optimal for the target GPU architecture.
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to improve the throughput of the bitwise AND operation.
