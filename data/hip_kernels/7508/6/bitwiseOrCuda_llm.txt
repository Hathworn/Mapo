```
// Use __restrict__ to improve compiler optimization possibilities
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if row sizes are uniform
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory efficiency
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and reduce latency
// Evaluate the impact of avoiding modulo operations on row offset calculations
