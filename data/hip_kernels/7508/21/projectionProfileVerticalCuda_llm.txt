// Ensure coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider loop unrolling to further optimize performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Balance the number of threads and blocks to maximize occupancy
// Evaluate the benefit of using texture memory for read-only data access
