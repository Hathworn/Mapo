```
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'image' and 'value' to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access when accessing 'value' elements.
// Align 'valueCount' to a multiple of 4 to ensure loop unrolling benefits.
// Ensure that 'differenceCount' is aligned to avoid atomic contention if necessary.
