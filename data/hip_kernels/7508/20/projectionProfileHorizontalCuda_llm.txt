```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Adjust the size of shared memory to balance occupancy and memory usage
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for image
// Optimize stride loop to minimize synchronization and maximize parallelism
// Use atomic operations efficiently to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
