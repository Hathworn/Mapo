// Use shared memory to load a tile of data for coalesced memory access
// Optimize global memory access patterns by ensuring alignment with warp size
// Consider using loop unrolling for the maximum operation if the loop is predictable
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper data layout
