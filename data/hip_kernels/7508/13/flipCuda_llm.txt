```
// Optimize the tile size in shared memory for better performance if necessary
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Consider using a larger tile size if shared memory allows, for reduced global memory access
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to only where it is absolutely necessary
// Align global memory accesses to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations if supported for further optimization
