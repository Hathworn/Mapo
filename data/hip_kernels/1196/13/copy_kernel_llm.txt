```cpp
// Use shared memory if possible to further improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider memory coalescing strategies to optimize global memory access.
// Ensure src and dest pointers are properly aligned for best performance.
// Analyze if a different block and grid size combination improves the kernel's efficiency.
// Profile the kernel execution to identify any bottlenecks related to memory access.
