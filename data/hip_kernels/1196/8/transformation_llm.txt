// Ensure shared memory size is properly defined based on blockDim.x
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize memory access by ensuring src and dest pointers are properly aligned
// Evaluate if prefetching values into registers before operations can improve performance
// Test different blockDim sizes to optimize for different GPU architectures
