```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for 'src' and 'dest' arrays.
// Consider using shared memory to cache 'src' data for faster access.
// Explore using asynchronous copy with hipMemcpyAsync for large data sets.
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency if possible.
// Evaluate using vectorized operations to enhance throughput (e.g., float4).
