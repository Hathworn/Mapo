```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store partial results if bias_dim is small to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning src and dest arrays to memory boundaries if possible
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to maximize warps and achieve better memory throughput
```
