```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory coalescing
// Ensure that src, dest, and z pointers are properly aligned for better memory access patterns
// Utilize loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Check for potential bank conflicts in shared memory access if shared memory is used
// Verify occupancy and adjust block size and grid size for optimal utilization of streaming multiprocessors
