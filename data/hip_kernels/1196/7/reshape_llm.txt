```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve cache efficiency
// Consider optimizing shared memory allocation size based on hardware specifications
// Ensure that memory coalescing is achieved when accessing src and dest arrays
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory
// Check if changing block and grid sizes can further optimize performance
