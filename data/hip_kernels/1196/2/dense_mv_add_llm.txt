// Use coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Ensure the number of threads is optimal for the targeted device architecture to minimize overhead.
// Consider possibility of shared memory usage if operations become more complex.
// Take advantage of memory alignment for faster memory accesses.
// Profile the application to find and eliminate memory access bottlenecks.
