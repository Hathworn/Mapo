```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns in writes to results array
// Minimize global memory access by reducing redundant calculations
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables within a block
// Optimize loop to avoid recalculating values that remain constant
// Ensure non-divergent branches within the kernel execution
