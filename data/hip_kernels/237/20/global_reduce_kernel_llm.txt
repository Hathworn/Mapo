```cpp
// Use coalesced global memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Consider using a double-buffered approach to further hide memory latency
// Optimize shared memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() for performance improvements
// Leverage warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of shared memory
