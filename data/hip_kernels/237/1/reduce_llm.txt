```
// Consider using cooperative groups for finer control over thread synchronization
// Use __shfl_sync instead of __shfl_down_sync if using older GPU architectures
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Allocate enough shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider using a loop unrolling technique for reducing latency
// Make sure shared memory size is power of two for easier reduction logic
// Check for potential warp divergence and minimize its impact
// Ensure that compiler flags are set for maximum optimization levels
