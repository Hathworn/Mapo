```
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated reads from global memory for d_x, d_y, and d_log_Y.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to d_r_new, d_g_new, and d_b_new for improved memory throughput.
// Utilize texture memory for d_cdf_norm if it exhibits spatial locality.
// Apply loop unrolling if there are any potential loops for optimization.
// Reduce arithmetic precision where possible to utilize hardware more efficiently.
