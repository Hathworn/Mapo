```
// Use shared memory if the same data is needed by multiple threads
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for improved throughput
// Minimize divergent branching for optimal warp execution
// Evaluate if loop unrolling is beneficial for this computation
