```
// Consider using shared memory for storing portions of d_g and d_b data to reduce global memory access.
// Align consecutive memory accesses to coalesced accesses for d_g and d_b to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate reducing the number of redundant computations inside the loops, especially image_offset_index_1d_clamped.
// Ensure that the thread block size is a multiple of the warp size for better performance.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to optimize the innermost loops for better performance.
