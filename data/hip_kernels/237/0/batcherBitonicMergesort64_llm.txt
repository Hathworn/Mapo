```
// Unroll loops to reduce overhead and increase performance
// Use warp-synchronous programming where possible to reduce synchronization
// Minimize shared memory access by maximizing use of registers
// Fine-tune shared memory layout to optimize bank conflicts
// Combine multiple conditional checks to reduce divergence
// Pre-fetch data into registers to reduce shared memory latency
