```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory coalescing by maintaining proper alignment of memory accesses
// Leverage vectorized loads/stores if possible for improved memory throughput
// Minimize divergence within warps by ensuring consistent control flow paths
