```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure a, b, and c are aligned to memory boundaries
// Use shared memory to cache data if there's reuse within the block
// Optimize block size to maximize warp occupancy
// Profile memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
