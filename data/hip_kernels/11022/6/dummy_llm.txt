```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access when applicable.
// Ensure memory coalescing in global memory accesses for better performance.
// Evaluate whether warp-level operations can be introduced to increase parallel efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive tasks to minimize loop overhead.
// Analyze alignment of data structures for potential efficiency gains in memory transactions.
// Explore asynchronous memory copy if overlapping computations can be leveraged.
// Inspect thread divergence to ensure all threads within a warp execute the same instructions.
