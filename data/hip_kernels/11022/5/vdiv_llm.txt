```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory reads
// Ensure input arrays are aligned for better performance
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Vectorize operations to increase computational throughput
// Launch kernels with optimal block size for better resource utilization
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel for increased efficiency
