```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for dgm0
// Minimize divergence by ensuring the warp has unified execution paths
// Ensure memory coalescing by using consecutive threads accessing consecutive memory addresses in q
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency where possible
// Optimize arithmetic operations to enhance performance
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize the for loop when reducing x
