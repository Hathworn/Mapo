```
// Use loop unrolling for better performance by reducing loop overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures if possible
// Use shared memory to avoid redundant global memory access if data can fit into shared memory
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data for faster access patterns
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads in a warp execute the same path
// Tune block and grid sizes for optimal use of available compute resources
