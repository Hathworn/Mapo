```
// Consider reducing redundant digamma_fl computation by storing intermediate results.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access to the q array.
// Use shared memory to cache qsum if it is a frequently accessed value, to minimize global memory reads.
// Minimize the number of operations inside the loop to improve kernel performance.
