// Use shared memory for intermediate computations to reduce global memory access
// Calculate wt using local registry computation to minimize memory reads
// Store intermediate results in shared memory to improve memory access efficiency
// Prevent repeated memory access by storing values in registers
// Write back the result of wt to global memory at the end of computation to optimize memory writes
