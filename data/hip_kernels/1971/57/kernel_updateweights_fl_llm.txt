```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize block and grid size for better occupancy and performance.
// Use __syncthreads() if data sharing among threads within a block is needed.
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to reduce instruction overhead.
