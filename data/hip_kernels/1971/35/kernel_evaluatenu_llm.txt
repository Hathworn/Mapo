```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing q using tid index
// Optimize digamma and log calculations: they are already coalesced and minimal
// Consider using shared memory for repeating calculations like log_term1 and log_term2
// Potential use of inline functions to avoid function call overhead for digamma
// Attempt to reduce the precision if acceptable for the application, using float instead of double
