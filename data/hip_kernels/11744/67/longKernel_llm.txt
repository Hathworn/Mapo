```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance
// Ensure memory alignment to prevent unaligned accesses
// Use shared memory if frequently accessing the same data
// Minimize divergent branching by reorganizing conditional checks
// Tune block size to maximize occupancy and throughput
// Consider asynchronous memory operations for data transfers
