// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory throughput
// Utilize warp-level primitives to synchronize threads and manage data sharing efficiently
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for faster data access and manipulation
