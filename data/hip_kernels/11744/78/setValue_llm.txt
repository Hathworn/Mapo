// Consider using shared memory for data caching to reduce global memory access latency
// Use warp-level primitives if access patterns are consistent to reduce divergence
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments to help compiler optimizations
// Consider loop unrolling if multiple values set in a loop for increased parallelism
