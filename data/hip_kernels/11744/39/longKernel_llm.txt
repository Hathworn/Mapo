```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth usage
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if the kernel does multiple reads
// Ensure all memory accesses are correctly aligned for better performance
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration (block size and grid size) to maximize occupancy
// Avoid divergent warps by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path
