```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency if applicable
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better performance in data manipulation
// Evaluate the impact of memory access patterns on performance and adjust as necessary
// Ensure kernel occupancy is optimized by checking register and shared memory usage
