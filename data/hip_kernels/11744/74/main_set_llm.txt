// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed values to reduce global memory reads.
// Optimize block size for better utilization of GPU resources and maximizing throughput.
// Align memory allocations to minimize overhead and improve access speed.
