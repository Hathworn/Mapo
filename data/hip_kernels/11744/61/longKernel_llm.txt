// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to improve memory access performance
// Ensure the data pointer is aligned for better memory access efficiency
// Explore coalesced memory access patterns
// Evaluate if shared memory usage could reduce global memory access
// Double-check the block size for optimal occupancy and performance
