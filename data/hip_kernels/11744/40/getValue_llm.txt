// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.  
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.  
// Avoid warp divergence by restructuring conditional statements.  
// Consider using thread synchronization for consistent shared memory utilization.  
// Optimize block and thread dimensions for maximum parallel efficiency.
