```cpp
// Consider loading kernel data into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Use memory coalescing techniques when accessing input and output arrays.
// Optimize thread block dimensions to increase occupancy and resource utilization.
// Ensure input data is accessed in a coalesced manner to maximize memory throughput.
// Leverage the use of __launch_bounds__ to control the number of register usage for better occupancy.
// Consider loop interchange if possible to improve cache utilization.
