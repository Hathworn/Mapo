```cpp
// Use __ldg() to load global memory where appropriate for read-only data to benefit from the texture cache.
// Optimize stride access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access where possible.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loops to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory traffic, ensuring bank conflicts are avoided.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for maximal occupancy on the GPU.
// Apply warp-level primitives such as __shfl_down_sync for partial reductions to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate different strategies for reducing the accumulated sums, possibly using separate reduction kernels for efficiency.
