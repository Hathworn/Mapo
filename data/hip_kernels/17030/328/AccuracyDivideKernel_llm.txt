// Ensure the variable 'accuracy' is not frequently accessed from global memory.
// Consider using shared memory for 'accuracy' if multiple operations are performed on it.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring only one thread block handles the division.
// Verify alignment and coalescing of access for 'accuracy' for optimal performance.
