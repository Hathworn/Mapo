// Use shared memory to optimize memory access if step size leads to uncoalesced memory access.  
// Consider incorporating asynchronous memory transactions for overlapping computation and memory transfer.  
// Optimize "if" statement to minimize warp divergence.  
// Ensure memory alignment of arr to enable efficient access.
