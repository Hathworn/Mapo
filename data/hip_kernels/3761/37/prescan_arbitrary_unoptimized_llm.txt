// Load input to shared memory in coalesced fashion for better memory access efficiency.
// Use vector loads (e.g., int2 or int4) for more efficient shared memory access.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper memory alignment.
// Add loop unrolling for operations within shared memory to reduce overhead.
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls to reduce warp synchronization overhead.
// Ensure boundary checks use conditional branching to avoid unnecessary divergence.
