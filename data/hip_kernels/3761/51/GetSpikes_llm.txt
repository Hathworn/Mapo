```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed variables
// Consider loop unrolling if any loops are present for minimizing overhead
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for improved performance
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data to enhance cache efficiency
// Evaluate warp-level primitives to reduce divergence in conditional statements
