```c
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate computations for faster access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring if conditions minimize warp divergence.
// Reuse registers to lower register usage if possible, improving performance on devices with limited register count.
