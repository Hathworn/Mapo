```
// Ensure coalesced access by using consecutive indices for memory access
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts
// Use __restrict__ pointers for compiler optimization
// Consider loop unrolling if operation is repeated
// Avoid divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same path
// Prefetch data into registers when possible
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce latency
