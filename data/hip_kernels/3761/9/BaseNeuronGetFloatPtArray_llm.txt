```
// Evaluate coalesced access to improve memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Ensure n_elem is a multiple of blockDim.x for better warp execution efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if step1 and step2 are constants
// Align memory access to avoid bank conflicts
