```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring pos is accessed in a contiguous manner
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
// Align memory access to 128-byte boundaries for better performance
// Implement loop unrolling if the loop contains repetitive computations
```
