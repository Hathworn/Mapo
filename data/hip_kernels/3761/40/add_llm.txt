```
// Consider using shared memory to cache n[blockIdx.x] for faster access
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for output array to maximize memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure output array is correctly aligned to prevent misaligned memory access penalties
// Consider using loop unrolling if more operations are performed in the kernel to improve instruction throughput
// Adjust block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and load balancing based on hardware specifications
