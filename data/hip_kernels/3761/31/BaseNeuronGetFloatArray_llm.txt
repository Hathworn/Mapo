```
// Improve memory access by ensuring arr1 and arr2 are aligned to avoid uncoalesced accesses
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize step1 and step2 to ensure they are multiples of warp size for better memory access patterns
// If possible, launch kernel with optimal block size for the device's architecture to maximize occupancy
// Experiment with different grid and block configurations to find the most efficient setup
// Ensure sufficient device memory is available and not over-subscribed to prevent bottlenecks
