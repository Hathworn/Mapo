```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use memory coalescing by aligning threads with memory access patterns
// Optimize block size for better occupancy and throughput
// Investigate potential use of constant memory for domain dimensions
// Unroll loops if applicable to minimize loop overhead
