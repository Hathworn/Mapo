// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy while ensuring enough shared memory is available.
// Ensure the WIDTH and block_size parameters are multiples of warp size to avoid divergence.
// Ensure shared memory is used effectively to minimize global memory accesses.
