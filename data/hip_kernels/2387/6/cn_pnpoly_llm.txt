```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Unroll loops to reduce branch divergence and improve instruction throughput.
// Use precomputed slopes to decrease redundant computation within the loop.
// Inline functions to reduce overhead associated with function calls.
// Avoid unnecessary computation by checking bounds early in the kernel.
// Optimize memory access patterns by grouping operations that access similar data.
// Utilize bitwise operations and integer arithmetic to minimize floating-point operations.
// Ensure proper alignment of shared memory usage to optimize bandwidth utilization.
