```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to global memory
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded before computation
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts
// Pre-fetch data to hide global memory latency
// Balance workload among threads to avoid divergent execution
