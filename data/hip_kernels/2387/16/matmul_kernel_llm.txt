```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring A and B are coalesced loaded into shared memory.
// Increase tile sizes (tile_size_y and tile_size_x) for larger shared memory tiles.
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads() is placed correctly for shared memory use.
// Use #pragma unroll to optimize loops with compile-time unrolling where beneficial.
// Store partial results directly in registers to reduce shared memory usage.
// Ensure block size is chosen to maximize occupancy while considering shared memory limits.
