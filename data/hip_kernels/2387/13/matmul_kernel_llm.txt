```cpp
// Consider maximizing data reuse by adjusting tile and block sizes.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing when loading blocks into shared memory.
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Ensure that grid and block dimensions are optimally configured.
