```
// Consider utilizing shared memory to cache input data tiles for faster access
// Avoid redundant global memory reads by preloading data into shared memory
// Calculate global indices once and reuse for reducing redundant operations
// Employ warp-shuffle for cross-thread data exchange if applicable in future
// Use const memory for kernel constants like threshold if they are constant
