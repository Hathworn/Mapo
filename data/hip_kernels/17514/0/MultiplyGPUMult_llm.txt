```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure all accesses to shared memory are coalesced.
// Unroll inner computation loop for increased performance.
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory.
// Consider using float4 where applicable for coalesced memory accesses.
