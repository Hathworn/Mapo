```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the matrix 'a'
// Utilize shared memory more effectively to store intermediate computations
// Minimize global memory atomic operations by accumulating partial sums in shared memory
// Ensure shared memory is used efficiently to avoid bank conflicts
// Balance workload across threads to prevent imbalanced memory access patterns
