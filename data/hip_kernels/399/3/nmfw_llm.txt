```
// Consider using shared memory to store parts of 'a' and 'h' to reduce global memory accesses.
// Perform loop unrolling in the innermost loops to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced for optimal memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use warp-synchronous programming if applicable to further optimize parallel reductions.
// Preload frequently accessed data into registers to minimize memory latency.
