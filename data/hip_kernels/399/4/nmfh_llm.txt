```
// Consider using shared memory for w to improve memory access patterns
// Use coalesced memory accesses for a by iterating over columns inside the loop
// Load h into shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Avoid recalculating w[j * k + row] and w[j * k + i] by storing in register
