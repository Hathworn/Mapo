// Use shared memory for input matrices A and W to optimize memory access patterns
// Use coalesced memory access for storing results back into matrix hcp
// Consider splitting the work between multiple kernel launches to reduce register pressure
// Reduce redundant memory operations by caching frequently accessed values in local variables
