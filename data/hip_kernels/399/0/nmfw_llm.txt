```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns for the 'a' and 'h' arrays.
// Preload data from global memory to shared memory to minimize repeated global memory access.
// Perform loop unrolling for the computation of 'sum_a' to reduce loop overhead and potentially increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns of 'a' and 'h' arrays when loading to shared memory.
// Consider using atomic operations or warp-synchronous programming to efficiently handle reductions across threads.
