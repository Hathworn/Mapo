```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to achieve maximum throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic where applicable
// Employ loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Explore using constant memory for read-only data to benefit from caching
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize transaction overhead and maximize coalescing
