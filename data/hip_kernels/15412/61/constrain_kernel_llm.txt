```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure INCX allows for optimal coalescing when accessing X.
// Adjust ALPHA to reside in shared memory if accessed frequently by threads.
// Verify that ALPHA is a constant or passed efficiently to the kernel.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel for better performance.
// Profile and tune blockDim.x and gridDim.x for optimal occupancy.
