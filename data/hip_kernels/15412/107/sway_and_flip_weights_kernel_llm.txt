```
// Pre-calculate common constants outside the loop to improve computational efficiency
// Align data memory access patterns to optimize coalesced memory accesses
// Consider replacing repetitive trigonometric function calls with pre-computed values for improved performance
// Optimize boundary checks to reduce conditionals within the loops
// Benefit from shared memory if possible to minimize global memory transactions
// Consider loop unrolling for small, fixed-size inner loops to enhance execution speed
