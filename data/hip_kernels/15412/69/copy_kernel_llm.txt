```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible within the block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to optimize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize strides by setting INCX and INCY to 1 if possible to enhance access patterns.
// Reduce memory divergence by aligning data accesses across threads in a warp.
