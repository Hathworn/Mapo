```
// Optimize memory coalescing by accessing delta in a more linear fashion
// Implement shared memory for delta if there are repeated accesses to the same data
// Consider loop unrolling for the nested loops to increase ILP (instruction-level parallelism)
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for delta and prev_delta pointers to avoid aliasing
// Precompute values like w_offset and h_offset outside the loop if they're constant within each block
