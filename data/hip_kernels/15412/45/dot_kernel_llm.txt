```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like output and delta.
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching to improve memory access latency.
// Minimize divergent branches, especially inside inner loops.
// Optimize the loop order to ensure coalesced memory access for the output array.
// Unroll inner loops to increase instruction throughput and improve performance.
// Assess if atomic operations on delta can be avoided to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate loop interchange strategy to improve memory access patterns.
