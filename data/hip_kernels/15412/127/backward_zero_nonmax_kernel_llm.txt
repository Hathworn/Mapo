```
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access for indexes and prev_delta.
// Use shared memory if there are common access patterns to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize thread block size for better utilization of GPU resources.
// Load the indexes value into a local register before using it for faster access.
