// Consider using shared memory to load portions of the input and weights to reduce global memory accesses.
// Precompute and store frequently used indices to save redundant calculations inside the loops.
// Check if using texture memory or constant memory for frequently accessed data can provide better performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by organizing data structures to minimize memory access latency.
// Optimize thread block size and grid size for best occupancy and performance balance, considering the hardware specifics.
