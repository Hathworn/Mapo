// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on GPU architecture for optimal occupancy.
// Use `__restrict__` qualifier on pointers to help the compiler with optimization.
