```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for input and weights to improve global memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimising bank conflicts when loading input and weights.
// Ensure data reuse by maximizing the use of shared memory for weights and inputs within thread blocks.
// Minimize synchronization points to reduce barrier overhead.
// Employ loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop control overhead during convolution operations.
// Utilize `__syncthreads()` judiciously to ensure shared memory is consistently updated.
// Use atomic operations cautiously on the output to minimize contention and potential bottlenecks.
