```
// Use shared memory to cache input data in blocks to reduce global memory access
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to improve efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning input and output arrays to improve throughput
// Optimize stride access patterns to prevent memory divergence and bank conflicts
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and latency
// Balance workload among threads to prevent idle threads and improve occupancy
