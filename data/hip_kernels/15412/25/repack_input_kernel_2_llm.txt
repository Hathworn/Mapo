// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory elements.
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning shared memory access patterns.
// Utilize shared memory to stage data for better memory access efficiency.
// Employ vectorized memory operations to leverage faster load/store instructions.
// Explore the use of texture or surface memory for cached access to input data.
