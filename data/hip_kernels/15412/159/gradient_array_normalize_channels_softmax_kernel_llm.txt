// Ensure coalesced memory access by keeping consecutive threads accessing consecutive memory locations
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access latency
// Reduce divergent branches within the kernel by rearranging code logic where possible
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
