// Consider using shared memory for pred and truth arrays to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure data alignment for pred and truth arrays to improve memory access speed.
// Prefetch the data using texture cache if spatial locality is strong.
