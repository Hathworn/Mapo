```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory loads.
// Consider preloading data into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Adjust the size of shared memory to accommodate the working set size.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by optimizing data layout.
// Maximize occupancy by choosing appropriate block size.
// Ensure alignment of data structures for efficient memory transactions.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead.
