```
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for better memory bandwidth usage
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize memory latency
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives to optimize reduction within warps
