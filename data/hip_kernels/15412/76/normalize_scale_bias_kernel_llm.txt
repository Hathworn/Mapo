```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables like scales and biases to minimize global memory reads.
// Consider using loop unrolling for operations involving spatial computations to optimize instruction throughput.
// Leverage warp-level primitives to reduce redundant calculations and improve memory coalescing.
// Optimize thread block size based on occupancy calculator to maximize parallel execution across the GPU.
