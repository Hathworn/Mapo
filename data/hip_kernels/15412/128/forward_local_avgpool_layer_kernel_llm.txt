```c
// Consider using shared memory for input tile to enhance memory access patterns.
// Ensure proper handling of padding to avoid unaligned memory accesses.
// Attempt loop unrolling to increase throughput.
// Evaluate potential benefits of using mixed precision where applicable.
// Explore reducing divisions by calculating reciprocal outside the loop.
