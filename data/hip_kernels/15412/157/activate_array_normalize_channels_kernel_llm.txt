```
// Cache values in shared memory to minimize global memory reads
// Calculate indices outside of the loops to optimize computations
// Use __syncthreads to ensure shared memory is fully populated before use
// Replace multiple global memory accesses with shared memory reads
// Optimize memory accesses by aligning shared memory usage with thread block size
// Accumulate sum in shared rather than global memory
// Combine calculation and normalization loops into fewer passes to reduce overhead
```
