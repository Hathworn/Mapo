// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread block size based on target GPU architecture
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop
// Use __restrict__ keyword for input and output pointer parameters
// Pre-compute repeated arithmetic expressions to improve efficiency
