```c
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for input data.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input[] and re_packed_input[] to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize the computation of indices.
// Avoid divergent branching in the conditional check by restructuring the loop or reordering threads.
// Preload frequently used variables like items_per_channel into registers to minimize memory latency.
