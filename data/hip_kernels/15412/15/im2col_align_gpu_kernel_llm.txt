```
// Minimize conditional checks within kernel to improve control flow
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads and writes
// Employ shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loops to reduce loop overhead
// Prefer __ldg() for read-only memory accesses to utilize texture cache
