```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure that the data loaded into shared memory fits within the block size.
// Synchronize threads after loading shared memory to ensure data consistency.
// Prefetch mean and variance data into shared memory for faster access.
// Reduce global memory access by computing on shared memory values.
// Ensure blocks are appropriately sized to utilize shared memory effectively.
// Consider optimal grid and block dimensions for memory access patterns.
