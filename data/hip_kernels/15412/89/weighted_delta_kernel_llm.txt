// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Analyze the possibility of using __restrict__ to minimize data aliasing
// Check if loop unrolling would benefit the critical kernel section
// Review usage of constant memory for frequently accessed values
