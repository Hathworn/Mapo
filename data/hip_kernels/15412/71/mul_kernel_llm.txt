```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for X and Y to enhance memory throughput.
// Ensure X and Y are aligned to improve access speed and reduce memory access latency.
// Use shared memory if possible to further optimize data reuse and reduce global memory access.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if shared memory usage is introduced.
// Ensure INCX and INCY values do not lead to excessive strided memory access.
