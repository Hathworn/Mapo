```
// Consider using shared memory for scales_c to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches to maximize warp execution efficiency.
// Preload data into registers where possible to reduce memory access time.
