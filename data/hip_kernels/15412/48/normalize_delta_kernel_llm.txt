```cpp
// Precompute common invariant expressions to reduce repetitive calculations
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables like mean and variance
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for delta array
// Optimize usage of registers by limiting the scope of variable declaration within the loop
```
