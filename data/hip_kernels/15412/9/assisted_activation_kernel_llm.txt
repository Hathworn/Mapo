```c
// Load elements from global memory only once outside the loop to minimize memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling pragma to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Check bounds early to avoid unnecessary calculations and improve warp execution efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
