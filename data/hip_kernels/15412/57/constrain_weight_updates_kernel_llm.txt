```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Coalesce global memory accesses to weights_gpu and weight_updates_gpu for better memory performance
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements
// Preload weights_gpu[i] and weight_updates_gpu[i] to local registers to optimize memory access
