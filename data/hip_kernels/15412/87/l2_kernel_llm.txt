```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access latency
// Preload data into registers to reduce repeated global memory access
// Explore warp-level primitives to handle divergence more efficiently
// Assess if memory coalescing is achievable by reorganizing data access pattern
// Investigate occupancy and adjust block size to better utilize GPU resources
