```
// Consider using shared memory to cache mean and variance values for each filter to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by appropriately aligning x, mean, and variance arrays as per HIP memory architecture.
// Use vectorized operations if possible to optimize throughput (e.g., float2 or float4).
// Check for bank conflicts when using shared memory and modify access patterns if necessary.
