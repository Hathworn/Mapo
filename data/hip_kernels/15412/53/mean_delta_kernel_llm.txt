```
// Use shared memory to store variance if multiple threads access the same value
// Use 'restrict' keyword to pointers if they do not alias to improve optimization
// Consider loop unrolling for spatial and batch loops for improved performance
// Pre-calculate repeated expressions to reduce computation within loops
