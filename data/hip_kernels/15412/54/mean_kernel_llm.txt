```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by optimizing index calculations
// Consider utilizing shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loops where possible to increase instruction throughput
// Investigate use of warp-level primitives to minimize divergence
// Adjust block size for optimum occupancy and performance
