```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for better performance.
// Ensure that out-of-bound memory accesses are checked and handled appropriately.
// Minimize the number of arithmetic operations within the kernel.
// Align data on memory boundaries to enhance memory throughput.
// Evaluate shared memory usage to avoid redundant global memory accesses.
