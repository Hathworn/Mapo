```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for input and output arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory reads within softmax_device
// Evaluate use of warp-level primitives for better parallelization
// Minimize divergent code paths by ensuring uniform branch decisions
// Ensure efficient memory synchronization to avoid race conditions
