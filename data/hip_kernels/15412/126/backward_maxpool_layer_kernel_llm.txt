```cpp
// Minimize thread divergence by merging condition checks in nested loops.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for 'delta' and 'indexes' to improve throughput.
// Use shared memory if data reuse between threads is possible to reduce global memory access.
// Eliminate bank conflicts for accessing shared memory by appropriate memory padding if used.
// Employ register blocking to minimize frequent global memory accesses.
// Launch kernel with optimal block size based on target GPU architecture.
