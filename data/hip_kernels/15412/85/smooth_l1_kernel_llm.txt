```
// Consider coalesced memory access for pred, truth, delta, and error
// Optimize shared memory usage for frequently accessed data
// Use loop unrolling if applicable for reducing loop overhead
// Ensure enough registers are allocated for simultaneous operations
// Minimize divergent branches within the if-else structure
