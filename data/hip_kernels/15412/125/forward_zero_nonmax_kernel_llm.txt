```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to potentially enable better compiler optimizations.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to maximize memory throughput.
// If possible, use float4 data type for loading/storing to minimize memory transactions.
// Avoid divergence by ensuring if-conditions affect entire warps in the same way.
// Prefetch input data into shared memory if applicable, to reduce global memory bandwidth.
