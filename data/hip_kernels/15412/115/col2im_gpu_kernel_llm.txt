```
// Precompute expressions and index calculations to reuse in the loop
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads from data_col
// Consider padding threads to avoid divergent branches
// Attempt loop unrolling for w_col and h_col if beneficial
// Ensure data_im writes are coalesced to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory if possible to store intermediate values
```
