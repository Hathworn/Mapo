```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to optimize memory access
// Use shared memory for scale to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Minimize bank conflicts while accessing shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance
