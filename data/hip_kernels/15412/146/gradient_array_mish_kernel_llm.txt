// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve access efficiency.
// Consider aligning memory accesses for activation_input_gpu to minimize bank conflicts.
// Use shared memory judiciously to store intermediate results and reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure shared memory is used optimally by minimizing unnecessary reuse and maximizing utilization.
// Consider optimizing the use of __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead.
