```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data as it can optimize caching
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by organizing data access patterns
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() for better warp execution efficiency
// Analyze if loop unrolling can provide a performance benefit
// Consider splitting large data chunks into smaller portions for better cache efficiency
// Profile memory usage to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
