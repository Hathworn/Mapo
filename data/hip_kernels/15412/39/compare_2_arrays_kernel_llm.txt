// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed global data.
// Use __syncthreads() to manage dependencies among threads.
// Explore warp shuffle functions for efficient data exchange within warps.
// Ensure coalesced access for read and write operations to global memory.
// Minimize divergence by organizing thread groups to avoid conditional branches.
