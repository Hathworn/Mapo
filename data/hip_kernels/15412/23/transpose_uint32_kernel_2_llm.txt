// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Align shared memory width to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing global memory accesses by warp
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory
// Optimize shared memory access pattern to reduce warp serialization
