```
// Consider using shared memory for mean_arr_gpu to reduce global memory access latency
// Utilize warp-level primitives to further accelerate operations on mean_arr_gpu
// Explore unrolling loops to improve thread-level parallelism and instruction throughput
// Use texture memory or constant memory for weights if they are accessed frequently and have spatial locality
