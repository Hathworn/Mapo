```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input array for improved memory bandwidth
// Consider splitting the kernel if the size is considerably large to avoid warp divergence
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring optimal access patterns within the warp
// Use shared memory for frequent data re-use if applicable
```
