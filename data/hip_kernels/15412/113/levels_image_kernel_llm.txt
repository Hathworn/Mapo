```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access to the image array
// Minimize divergence in the kernel function by simplifying conditional statements
// Utilize shared memory to store commonly accessed variables if beneficial
// Integrate constant memory for the rand array if its values remain unchanged
// Combine RGB to HSV and HSV to RGB transformations for reduced computational overhead
