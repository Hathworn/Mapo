```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'input' array to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory to temporarily store utilized weights data inside each block.
// Use warp-level primitives to perform parallel reduction on 'sum' for better performance.
// Optimize 'index' calculation to minimize redundant operations and improve warp divergence.
// Ensure optimal block and grid size to maximize GPU occupancy and efficiency.
