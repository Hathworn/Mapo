```
// Optimize global memory access by minimizing pointer arithmetic within loops
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Precompute frequently used values like scale to register before the loop
// Unroll small loops to reduce branch overhead if beneficial
// Check alignment of data to utilize coalesced memory accesses
