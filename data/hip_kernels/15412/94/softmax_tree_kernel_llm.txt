```
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from and writing to global memory.
// Exploit shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access latency.
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync to optimize reduce operations.
// Increase block size to maximize occupancy without exceeding shared memory per block.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to balance the workload across SMs efficiently.
// Consider using float2 for memory transactions to reduce memory bandwidth usage.
