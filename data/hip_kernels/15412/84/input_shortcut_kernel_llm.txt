```
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescence.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Prefetch data to registers where possible to reduce redundant memory accesses.
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for better throughput.
// Minimize branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
