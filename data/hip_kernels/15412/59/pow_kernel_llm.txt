```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations in global memory
// Consider using shared memory if there's data reuse among threads
// Optimize the loop by unrolling it to improve throughput
// Verify the usage of powf, as it can be computationally expensive; consider alternatives if possible
```
