```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache input data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Avoid using shared memory synchronization if possible to reduce overhead.
// Prefetch the next data element if the loop is likely to access it.
```
