```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data if X is reused frequently within the loop
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Check if the use of __restrict__ pointers can reduce pointer aliasing overhead
// Evaluate using pinned memory for faster data transfer between host and device
// Consider vectorized operations if INCX is a multiple of vector width
