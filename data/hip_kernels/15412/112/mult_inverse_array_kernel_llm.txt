```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for src_gpu and dst_gpu to improve performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts and avoid shared memory access if not necessary.
// Utilize fast math functions available in HIP for operations like powf.
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is chosen to maximize GPU occupancy.
// Use __powf for single-precision floating-point performance improvement.
