```
// Pre-compute common expressions outside of repeated operations to reduce computational overhead.
// Use inbounds function to eliminate repeated out-of-bounds condition checks and improve clarity.
// Minimize atomic operations by combining calculations where possible.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to improve memory access times.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalesced access in global memory.
