```
// Consider using shared memory to hold data that will be reused by threads in the same block to minimize global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads from `loc_`, which are already implemented as `ptidx` is used.
// Ensure that `x` and `y` arrays are also accessed in a coalesced manner as the memory access is done sequentially with respect to `ptidx`.
// Evaluate if arithmetic operations can be rearranged to take advantage of instruction-level parallelism or fused multiply-add (FMA) instructions.
// Review the use of `scale` as a constant to ensure it doesn't change per kernel launch, which aids in optimization by the compiler.
