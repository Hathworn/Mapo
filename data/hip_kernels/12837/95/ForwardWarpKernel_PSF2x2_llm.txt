```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning access patterns to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data from global memory and reduce memory latency.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by restructuring conditional logic to maintain SIMD efficiency.
// When possible, use __ldg() for read-only data access to leverage cache benefits.
// Explore loop unrolling for operations within the lambda to reduce instruction overhead.
// Apply prefetching techniques to preload data when predictable access patterns are identified.
// Use the restrict keyword on pointers where applicable to aid compiler optimization.
