// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate data for more efficient access.
// Use __ldg() for faster read-only cache access, as done with loc_ array.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target GPU architecture.
// Minimize global memory accesses by using registers whenever possible.
// Align data structures to reduce memory access latency.
