// Consider using shared memory to optimize repeated access to normalization_factor
// Use float4 or float2 to access multiple image elements simultaneously, if data alignment permits
// Prefetch normalization_factor values into registers before the loop to reduce global memory access
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy based on the GPU architecture
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures and choosing appropriate strides
