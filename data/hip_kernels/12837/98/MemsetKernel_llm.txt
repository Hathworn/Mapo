```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if possible
// Minimize bank conflicts by padding shared memory when necessary
// Prefer coalesced global memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling if it can improve performance
// Ensure enough threads per block to fully utilize GPU resources
```
