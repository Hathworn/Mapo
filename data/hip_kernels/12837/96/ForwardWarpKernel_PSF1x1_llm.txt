// Consider coalesced memory access by restructuring data layout or accessing contiguous memory
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in local variables
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize use of atomic operations if possible, as they can introduce serialization and affect performance
