```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for both tensor and src to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that the access patterns are aligned and contiguous to benefit from coalesced memory reads.
// Utilize shared memory if data reuse is high between threads to minimize global memory bandwidth usage.
// Assess the impact of register pressure caused by unrolling and optimize based on hardware capabilities.
// Evaluate the occupancy and thread block size to maintain optimal thread utilization.
