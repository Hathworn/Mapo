```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access times.
// Optimize memory access patterns to facilitate coalesced reads.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning data access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced within the loops.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize output processing.
// Reduce redundant calculations by optimizing loop index increments.
