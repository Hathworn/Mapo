```
// Consider using shared memory for normDistPrefixSum to reduce global memory access.
// Aggregate random number generation to reduce overhead and improve performance.
// Use atomic operations to update origDist if necessary to handle concurrent writes.
// Evaluate if memory coalescing can be improved for accessing origDist and dest arrays.
