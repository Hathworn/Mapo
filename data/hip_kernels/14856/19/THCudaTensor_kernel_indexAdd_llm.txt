```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure index computations avoid repeated calculations by leveraging shared or register memory.
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by organizing threads to access consecutive memory addresses.
// Reevaluate atomic operation usage for efficiency, as it might cause serialization and reduce performance.
// Use loop unrolling when accessing data within loops for improved performance.
