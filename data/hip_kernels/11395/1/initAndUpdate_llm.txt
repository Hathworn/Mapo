```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Use a stride pattern to improve coalesced memory access
// Implement loop unrolling for the inner loop to decrease overhead
// Consider banking in shared memory to improve performance and reduce conflicts
// Evaluate the impact of using __restrict__ keyword to potentially improve memory access speeds
// Tune block and grid dimensions to match the GPU architecture and maximize occupancy
