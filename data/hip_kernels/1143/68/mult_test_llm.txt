```
// Consider memory coalescing for a, b, c arrays to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure a, b, c arrays are aligned for optimal global memory load/store.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if data reuse is possible within a block.
// Evaluate the impact of loop unrolling if operations inside mult() contain iteration.
// Analyze and reduce memory divergence by organizing threads' access patterns.
