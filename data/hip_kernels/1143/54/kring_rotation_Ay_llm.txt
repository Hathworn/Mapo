```
// Optimize memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Load data into shared memory to increase access speed
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block
// Ensure coalesced memory access for A[gid] in the global memory
// Consider reducing bank conflicts in shared memory access
