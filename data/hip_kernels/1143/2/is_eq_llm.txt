```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for array 'a' and 'b' to improve global memory efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory more efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Use atomic operations to update shared memory in parallel rather than assigning directly.
// Consider dividing the grid into smaller blocks to increase parallelization.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to optimize the comparisons.
// Implement more aggressive thread synchronization using warp shuffle.
