```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Precompute trigonometric functions if inputs to atan2 and cos are constants
// Consolidate memory accesses to minimize latency
// Check for warp divergence and attempt to reduce it
