```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data if necessary
// Minimize register and shared memory usage to allow for more concurrent threads
// Opt for appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy
```
