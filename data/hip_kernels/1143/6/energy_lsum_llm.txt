```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Minimize the use of global memory by maximizing the use of registers and shared memory
// Ensure that loads and stores to global memory are coalesced
// Align data structures to 128 bytes to optimize global memory transactions
// Try to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring memory access patterns are optimal
// Balance the number of threads per block to maximize occupancy and resource utilization
