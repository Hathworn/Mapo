```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to A by ensuring gid follows a contiguous pattern
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency, especially for frequently accessed variables
// Align data structures to ensure that memory accesses are cache-friendly
// Prefetch data to registers for thread usage to minimize repeated global memory access
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring thread accesses to shared memory are staggered
// If possible, employ loop unrolling for any loops within computations to reduce overhead
```
