```
// Use shared memory to cache repeated global memory accesses for 'items' array
// Consider coalesced access patterns for 'x', 'y', 'z' arrays
// Minimize repeated calculations by storing intermediate results in registers
// Align memory allocations for 'Ax', 'Ay', 'Az', 'V' to improve memory access efficiency
// Group memory accesses to take advantage of memory coalescing
// Ensure appropriate memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory
