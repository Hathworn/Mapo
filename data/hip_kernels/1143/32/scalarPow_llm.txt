```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses in the global kernel.
// Use shared memory where possible for better memory access patterns.
// Reduce the number of sqrt and pow function calls by storing intermediate results.
// Ensure the use of atan2 for improved precision in angle calculation.
// Optimize trigonometric calculations with pre-computed values if param is constant.
