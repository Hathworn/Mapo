```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data blocks to reduce global memory access cost.
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring that threadId.x accesses contiguous memory locations.
// Use loop unrolling techniques if suitable to optimize arithmetic operations within the kernel.
// Ensure memory alignment to enhance memory access efficiency if data sizes and alignments allow.
// Minimize branch divergence by structuring conditions that ensure threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
