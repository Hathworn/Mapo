```
// Reorder threadIdx and blockIdx to improve memory access pattern
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access with thread index
// Use shared memory to minimize repeated global memory access and enhance data reuse
// Consider using warp-level primitives for operations involving multiple threads
// Implement loop unrolling for the computations within the kernel to reduce branch divergence
// Avoid memory bank conflicts by properly accessing shared memory
// Minimize the usage of double precision if single precision provides sufficient accuracy
