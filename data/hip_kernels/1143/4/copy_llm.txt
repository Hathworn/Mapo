// Consider using shared memory for faster data access
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent warps by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned on 128-byte boundaries for optimal throughput
