```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Check for opportunities to use vectorized data types for enhanced throughput.
// If possible, reduce redundant recalculations of grid dimensions.
