```
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring the input arrays are contiguous
// Optimize by increasing thread block size, if resources allow
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access similar input data
// Ensure memory alignment for efficient data loading
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive evolution type checks within make_complex function
// Reduce redundant calculations by storing repetitive -in computation
