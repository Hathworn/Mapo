```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for temporary variables to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures.
// Minimize the use of global memory and prefer using registers for computing intermediate results.
// Analyze memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
