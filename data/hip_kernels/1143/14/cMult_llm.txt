// Consider using shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by checking alignment of data structures
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling could improve performance
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Investigate the use of asynchronous memory copies to overlap computation and memory transfer
