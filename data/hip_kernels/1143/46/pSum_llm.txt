// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loading in1[gid] into shared memory.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing sdata2 within shared memory.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during the reduction loop.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used only where absolutely necessary to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Consider unrolling the reduction loop to improve performance.
