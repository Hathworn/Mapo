// Optimization: Use shared memory to cache repetitive data access for x, y, z arrays
// Optimization: Align A array pointer for coalesced access
// Optimization: Unroll loops for improved parallel execution, if applicable
// Optimization: Reduce register pressure by minimizing the use of temporary variables
