// Ensure data alignment for coalesced memory access patterns.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring 'factor' and 'out' arrays are aligned properly.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed 'factor' data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Analyze the memory access pattern for 'in' and 'factor' to ensure optimal access.
