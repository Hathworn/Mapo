```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve bandwidth.
// Consider using float2 instead of double2 if precision allows, to reduce memory usage.
// Ensure memory allocation is done using hipMalloc for better alignment and performance.
// Explore asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation with data transfer.
