```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that a and c arrays are accessed sequentially by threads
// Ensure a and c arrays are allocated with proper alignment to minimize bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into shared memory if the data will be reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses
// Balance computational work per thread to better utilize the GPU resources and reduce idle threads
