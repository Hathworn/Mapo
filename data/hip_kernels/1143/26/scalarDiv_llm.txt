```
// Consider using shared memory for the 'in' array to improve data locality.
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in 'in' and 'out' arrays.
// Evaluate if factor could be stored in a register to reduce memory read latency.
// Ensure 'gid' calculation is optimal and doesn't introduce unnecessary computations.
