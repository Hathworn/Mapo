```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for input and output arrays
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Utilize loop unrolling in the reduction loop to improve performance
// Investigate warp synchronization for better efficiency
// Consider occupancy impacts when tuning block and grid dimensions
