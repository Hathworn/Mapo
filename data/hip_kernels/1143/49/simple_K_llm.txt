```
// Consider using shared memory for xp, yp, zp to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Use vectorized loads if possible for xp, yp, zp to improve memory throughput
// Optimize memory coalescing by reordering access patterns for arrays xp, yp, zp
// Implement loop unrolling in computation section for better parallel execution
