```
// Consider split memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Use shared memory to minimize repeated global loads
// Optimize data layout for better memory access patterns
// Use warp shuffle or atomic operations for better intra-block communication
// Minimize aggressive thread divergence by aligning conditional logic
