```
// Consider coalesced memory access for global memory operations.
// Utilize memory padding if necessary to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and performance.
// Ensure all accesses to shared memory are aligned to prevent uncoalesced accesses.
// Consider using asynchronous copies if applicable for shared memory data prefetch.
// Ensure enough available shared memory to avoid over-subscription.
// Profile the kernel to check if shared memory usage limits occupancy.
// Use atomics instead of global array writes if applicable to reduce memory traffic.
// Balance workload to minimize idle threads and ensure all SMs are utilized.
