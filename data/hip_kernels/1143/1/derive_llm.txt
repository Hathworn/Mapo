```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'data' array to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory where possible to reduce global memory accesses and improve cache locality.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for 'data' and 'out' arrays to optimize access speed.
// Minimize conditional checks within the kernel to maximize computational efficiency.
// Explore the use of asynchronous copy operations for data transfer between global and shared memory.
