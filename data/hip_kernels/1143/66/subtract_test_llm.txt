// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for optimal performance
// Ensure proper memory alignment for double2 type to avoid additional overhead
// Explore using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Analyze the occupancy and consider optimizing the block size for better performance
