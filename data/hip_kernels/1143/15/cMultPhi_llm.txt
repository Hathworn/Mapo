```cpp
// Use shared memory if in1 and in2 data reuse occurs within the same block to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for better memory coalescing.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are configured to maximize occupancy.
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring threads to follow similar execution paths.
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory access patterns, especially if the hardware prefers certain alignments.
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency if computation to memory access ratio allows it.
// Opt for restricting pointers with __restrict__ if applicable to enable additional compiler optimizations.
// Investigate the use of asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap computation with memory transfers.
