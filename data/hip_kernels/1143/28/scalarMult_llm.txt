```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency
// Use vectorized data types for coalesced memory access and improved throughput
// Consider unrolling loops to decrease the loop overhead and increase parallel efficiency
// Align memory accesses to ensure coalesced access patterns
// Optimize conditional statements to reduce divergence and improve warp execution efficiency
// Prefetch data into registers when possible to hide memory latency and improve performance
