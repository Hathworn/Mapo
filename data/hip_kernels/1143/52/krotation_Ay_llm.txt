```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to A by aligning 'gid' correctly
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables like xMax, yMax, zMax
// Calculate repeated expressions outside the loop to save computation
// Prefetch data for x into shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to further exploit instruction level parallelism
