// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Evaluate usage of shared memory for faster data access
// Check for bank conflicts to optimize memory access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling for potential performance gains
// Evaluate register usage to ensure minimal spills
// Review occupancy to ensure number of threads per block is optimal
