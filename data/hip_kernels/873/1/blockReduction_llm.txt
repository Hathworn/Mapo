// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Optimize memory access pattern to utilize coalesced memory access
// Consider using warp shuffle or atomic operations for parallel data reduction
// Verify if unnecessary conditions can be omitted for performance improvement
// Evaluate data usage and optimize thread block size based on the architecture
