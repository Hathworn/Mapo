// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory loads
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory reads
// Consider loop unrolling for mean computation to enhance performance
// Ensure shared memory is utilized efficiently for simultaneous reads and writes
// Profile to determine if further occupancy optimization is possible
