```
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Use shared memory to cache data if there are frequently reused values
// Optimize loop unrolling for improved instruction-level parallelism
// Utilize '__restrict__' pointers if pointers do not alias for better compiler optimization
// Consider using warp size (e.g., 32 in most GPUs) aligned data access for further optimization
