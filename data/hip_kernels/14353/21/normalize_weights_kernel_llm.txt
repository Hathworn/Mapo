```
// Use shared memory for weights in each block to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for weights and CDF to improve performance
// Implement loop unrolling in cdfCalc for better instruction-level parallelism
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
// Ensure alignment of memory access for partial_sums and seed arrays
