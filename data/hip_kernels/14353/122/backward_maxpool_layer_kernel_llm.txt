```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if possible to reduce global memory operations
// Ensure coalesced memory access for delta, prev_delta, and indexes arrays 
// Consider loop unrolling for the pooling window loops to enhance performance 
// Minimize the use of atomic operations as they can serialize memory access
```
