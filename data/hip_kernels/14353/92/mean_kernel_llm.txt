```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns
// Utilize loop unrolling further, especially for known fixed sizes
// Explore using warp shuffles to minimize shared memory usage for partial sums
// Check if more complex techniques like prefetching could be applicable
