```
// Use coalesced memory access for reading x to improve memory throughput.
// Consider loading x into shared memory if n is small and reusing it within the block.
// Use warp shuffle instructions to reduce the need for global memory access.
// Minimize stride access to improve cache efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.
