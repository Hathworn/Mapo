```
// Consider coalescing memory access for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory if applicable to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of hardware caching
// Evaluate the use of half precision for operations if precision is not critical
// Analyze the possibility of using warp-level primitives to optimize thread communication
