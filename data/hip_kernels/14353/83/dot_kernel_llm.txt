// Consider using shared memory to cache output values for f1 and f2 to reduce global memory accesses
// Evaluate the benefit of loop unrolling within batch and size loops for performance improvement
// Test pre-computing repetitive calculations like (b * size * n) before inner loops to save computation time
// Assess the practicality of minimizing atomic operations through data reduction strategies
// Explore using float4 or float2 vectorized data types for packed operations if hardware supports it
