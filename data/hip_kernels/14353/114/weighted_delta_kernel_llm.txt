```
// Use coalesced memory access to maximize memory bandwidth utilization
// Avoid branch divergence by placing conditions outside loops when possible
// Prefetch data into shared memory if the data is reused frequently
// Consider using float4 or similar structures for better memory access patterns
// Check alignment of data for efficient caching and access
