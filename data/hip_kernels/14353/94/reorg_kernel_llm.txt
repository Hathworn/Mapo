```c
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data properly.
// Consider optimizing thread block size for efficient memory use.
// Use shared memory if reuse of data across threads is possible.
// Evaluate the benefits of loop unrolling if applicable.
// Minimize divergent branches, especially within conditioning.
// Ensure proper alignment of output data to enhance performance.
