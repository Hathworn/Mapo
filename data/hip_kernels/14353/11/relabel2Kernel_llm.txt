// Optimize memory access by ensuring memory coalescing for components array access  
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if possible  
// Leverage warp-level primitives to reduce divergence in the conditional branch  
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory during data handling  
// Preload components into registers to further decrease global memory accesses  
// Consider loop unrolling if idx has a repetitive pattern
