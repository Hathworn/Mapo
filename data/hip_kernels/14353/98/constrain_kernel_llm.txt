```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to align data accesses and improve coalescing.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and maximize instruction throughput.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are configured to maximize occupancy and utilize all stream processors.
