```
// Minimize redundant computations by calculating index once.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for pred and truth arrays.
// Ensure the kernel handles boundary conditions to prevent out of bounds access.
// Optimize memory usage by calculating error and delta within the same if statement block.
