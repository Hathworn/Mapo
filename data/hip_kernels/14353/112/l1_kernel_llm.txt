// Consider optimizing memory accesses by utilizing shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve data throughput.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads when needed for shared memory usage.
// Analyze warp divergence and minimize it by aligning control flow paths.
// If possible, fuse multiple operations to reduce kernel launch overhead.
