```c
// Use __restrict__ keyword for in_delta and out_delta to optimize memory access
// Align data pointers to improve memory coalescing
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use fewer atomic operations by aggregating results in shared memory first
// Optimize out_index and in_index calculation to minimize redundant operations
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize loop further
```
