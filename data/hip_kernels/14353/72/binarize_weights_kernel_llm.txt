```
// Consider optimizing the use of shared memory further by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance.
// Ensure the atomic operation on mean is correctly managing race conditions.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize the reduction operation.
// Double-check that shared memory usage does not exceed available per block.
// Ensure that shared memory is properly synchronized and reused effectively.
