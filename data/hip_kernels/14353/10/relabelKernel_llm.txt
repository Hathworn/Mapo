```cpp
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Prefetch data using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Evaluate reorganizing loops to maximize warp execution efficiency
// Investigate the impact of using vectorized data types to optimize alignment and bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism
