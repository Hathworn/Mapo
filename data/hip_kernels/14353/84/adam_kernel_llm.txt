```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for x, m, and v arrays by checking aligned indices
// Use shared memory to store intermediate calculations if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider unrolling loops for small fixed-size operations to decrease control overhead
// Use warp shuffle operations for efficient reduction computations if applicable
// Evaluate using atomic operations for m and v updates if concurrent writes occur
```
