```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for pred and truth arrays.
// Ensure pred and truth arrays are aligned for coalescing.
// Optimize stride to match warp size for better occupancy.
// Minimize divergence by restructuring the if-else logic.
// Consider using texture memory for better cache efficiency.
