```c
// Prefetch data into shared memory to exploit data locality and reduce global memory access latency
// Align data accesses to avoid uncoalesced global memory transactions
// Consider using float4 instead of float for vectorized memory operations
// Ensure INCX and INCY are set to 1 to maintain coalesced accesses, if possible
// Balance the grid and block dimensions based on the GPU architecture for optimal occupancy
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if applicable to optimize memory access patterns
