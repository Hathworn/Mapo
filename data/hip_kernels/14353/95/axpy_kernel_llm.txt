```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring X and Y are coalesced
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction level parallelism
// Check alignment of X and Y for potential vectorized read/write
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to improve occupancy
