```
// Precompute the normalization constant once per block to reduce redundant calculations
// Utilize shared memory to store the normalization constant and minimize global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have the calculated normalization constant before proceeding
// Implement loop unrolling by processing multiple elements per thread for better memory access patterns
