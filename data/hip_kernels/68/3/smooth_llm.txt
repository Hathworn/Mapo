```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve performance
// Explore the use of vectorized loads for contiguous data access
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead in loop-bound operations
// Evaluate if using float2 or float4 could lead to better memory throughput
