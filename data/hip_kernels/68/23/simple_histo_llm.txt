```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory with zeros to ensure a clean state
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within the block
// Perform atomic operations on shared memory to reduce contention in global memory
// Transfer cumulative results from shared to global memory efficiently
