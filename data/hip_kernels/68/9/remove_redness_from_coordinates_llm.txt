// Consider using shared memory to cache d_coordinates in smaller blocks to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement loop unrolling for the pixel iteration loops to improve localization and processing efficiency.
// Use texture memory for accessing color channels to leverage hardware caching capabilities and minimize global memory delay.
// Evaluate using warp shuffles to reduce instructions in computing indices and minimize redundant computations.
