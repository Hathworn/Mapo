```
// Consider utilizing coalesced memory accesses for reading input data into shared memory
// Evaluate the use of vectorized loads/store operations to improve memory throughput
// Assess if double-buffering can reduce shared memory bank conflicts during sorting stages
// Investigate using warp-synchronous programming to minimize synchronization overhead
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized to allow maximum occupancy
// Align data structures to prevent potential alignment issues on certain hardware architectures
