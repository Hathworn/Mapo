```c
// Maintain the function as a placeholder for potential future synchronization requirements.
// If significant global communication becomes necessary, use efficient synchronization mechanisms.
// Eliminate unnecessary operations to reduce kernel launch overhead.
// Explore memory coalescing techniques if memory access patterns are introduced later.
// Monitor the usage of shared memory to prevent bank conflicts in future implementations.
