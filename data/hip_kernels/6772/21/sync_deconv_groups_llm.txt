```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data in shared memory
// Align data accesses to improve memory coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Optimize the number of threads per block to maximize occupancy
```
