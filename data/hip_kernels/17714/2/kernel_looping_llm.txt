```cpp
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using vectorized operations if accessing multiple contiguous elements.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning thread accesses to contiguous memory segments.
// Optimize loop unrolling based on the hardware's warp size.
// Minimize divergent branching within the loop to enhance warp execution efficiency.
