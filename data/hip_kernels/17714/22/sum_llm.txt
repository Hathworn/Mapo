```
// Consider alignment for input and output arrays to improve coalesced memory access
// Use float4 data type for input to perform vectorized loads/stores and reduce memory transaction overhead
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal by tuning blockDim.x for the specific GPU architecture
// Utilize warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization barriers during reduction
// Parallelize atomicAdd operations by using multiple atoms for different sections
