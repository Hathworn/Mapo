```
// Use shared memory to reduce contention on global memory
// Initialize shared memory to improve access latency
// Reduce the number of atomic operations on global memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory
// Accumulate results in shared memory before writing back to global memory
