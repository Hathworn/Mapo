```c
// Consider coalescing memory access by aligning data structures to ensure optimal global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate the possibility of using shared memory if data reuse can be exploited within the block.
// Check memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if implemented in future iterations.
// Ensure that A, B, and C are aligned and padded appropriately to avoid misaligned memory access penalties.
// Minimize conditional statements within the warp execution to prevent warp divergence.
