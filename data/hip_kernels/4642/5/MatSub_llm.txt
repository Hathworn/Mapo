```
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for A, B, and C
// Use shared memory to store tile data from A and B to improve memory access efficiency
// Minimize global memory access by combining more operations in the same kernel
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling to increase performance
// Ensure efficient use of registers, avoid excessive register pressure
// Experiment with different block and thread configurations for better utilization
