```
// Reuse computed thread and block indices to minimize repeated calculations
// Ensure memory coalescing by maintaining contiguous memory access patterns
// Use shared memory where appropriate to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling if there are repetitive small loop iterations
// Utilize vectorized memory operations to increase data throughput
