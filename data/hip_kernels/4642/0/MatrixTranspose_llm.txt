// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure data is coalesced in global memory accesses for better performance.
// Evaluate whether asynchronous copying or prefetching can enhance memory throughput.
// Assess if loop unrolling might improve the kernel execution efficiency.
