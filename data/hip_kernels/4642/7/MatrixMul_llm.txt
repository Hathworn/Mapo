// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access for a and b
// Consider using double buffering technique to overlap computation and data transfer
// Evaluate potential for loop unrolling to improve computational efficiency
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits to prevent bank conflicts
// Optimize occupancy by adjusting block size and thread count to maximize throughput
