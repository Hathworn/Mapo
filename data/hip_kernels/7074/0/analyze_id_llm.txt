```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory fetch efficiency
// Ensure data alignment for accessing structures in global memory
// Consider using shared memory if kernel needs reuse of data across threads
// Utilize loop unrolling if N becomes significantly large for further optimization
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
