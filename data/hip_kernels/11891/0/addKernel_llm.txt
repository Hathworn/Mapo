```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same memory locations
// Optimize block and grid size to maximize occupancy and minimize execution time
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed variables if applicable
// Check for warp divergence and minimize conditional statements
