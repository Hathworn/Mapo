```
// Use shared memory to store parts of maskMap for faster access
// Coalesce memory accesses by rearranging data or computations
// Minimize divergent branches by checking conditions outside loops
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed constants like `fpPlaneDepth`
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for repeated operations
