```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache isims and idpts for faster access.
// Use coalesced access patterns for osim and odpt to improve global memory efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branches within thread blocks to enhance warp execution.
// Investigate if replacing division operations with multiplications by constants yields performance gains.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned and continuous to leverage the memory bandwidth.
