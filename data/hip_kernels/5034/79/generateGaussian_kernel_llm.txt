// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Precompute constant kernel coefficient for reuse
// Store intermediate results in shared memory to minimize repeated calculations
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory consistency
// Use faster device function __expf for exponential calculation
