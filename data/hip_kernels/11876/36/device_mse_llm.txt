```
// Consider aligning memory accesses of d_output and d_targets for coalesced access.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data if possible to improve cache performance.
// Implement a shared memory bank conflict avoidance strategy to enhance performance.
// Evaluate shared memory usage to ensure it does not exceed maximum capacity, leading to reduced occupancy.
// Minimize divergence by letting all threads within a warp execute the same instructions.
