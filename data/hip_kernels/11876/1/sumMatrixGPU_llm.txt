// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if necessary.
// Ensure correct memory alignment to prevent misaligned access penalties.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to optimize performance.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize GPU occupancy.
