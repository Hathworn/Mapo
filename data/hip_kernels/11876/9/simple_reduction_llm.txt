```
// Optimize memory access to reduce bank conflicts
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for reduction to improve performance
// Ensure shared memory utilization is appropriate for the number of threads per block
// Align data structures if possible to improve memory coalescing
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied for the stride calculation
// Review atomic operations for potential bottleneck on large data sets
