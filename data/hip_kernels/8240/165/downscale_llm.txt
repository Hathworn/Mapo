// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data access patterns
// Use shared memory to store tile data, if possible, to reduce global memory transactions
// Consider loop unrolling inside the scale_factor loops for potential performance gain
// Minimize divergent threads by ensuring consistent execution paths
