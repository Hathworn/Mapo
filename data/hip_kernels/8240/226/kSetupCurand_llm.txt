```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to ensure consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring memory access patterns align with memory architecture.
// Consider prefetching data to cache or shared memory to reduce global memory latency.
// Use warp-level synchronization to improve efficiency and reduce divergence.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to maximize memory transaction throughput.
