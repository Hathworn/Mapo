```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data access patterns to benefit from coalesced memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branching for efficiency
// Ensure data is prefetched into the cache where possible
// Verify grid and block sizes are optimal for the hardware
// Consider using memory access patterns that maximize memory throughput
