// Use shared memory efficiently by ensuring coalesced accesses from input to shared memory.
// Consider loop unrolling deeper to reduce loop control overhead.
// Remove unnecessary synchronizations if memory writes are guaranteed to not overlap.
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Validate if warp reduction can replace thread block reduction for smaller problem sizes.
