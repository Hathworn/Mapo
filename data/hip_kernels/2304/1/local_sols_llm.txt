```
// Prefer using registers over shared memory for frequently accessed variables
// Reduce the number of accesses to global memory when possible
// Use warp-level synchronization instead of __syncthreads() where applicable
// Align memory accesses to reduce latencies
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data properly
// Minimize division operations by refactoring calculations
```
