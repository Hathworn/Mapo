```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Reduce the number of divergent branches to improve warp efficiency.
// Implement memory prefetching to hide memory latency.
// Align data structures to cache-line boundaries for better cache performance.
// Utilize asynchronous memory operations where applicable to overlap computation and communication.
