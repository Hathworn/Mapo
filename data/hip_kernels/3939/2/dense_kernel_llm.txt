```
// Unroll the loop to reduce the number of iterations and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Use shared memory if possible to cache inputs or weights and reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure the kernel launch configurations (block size and grid size) are optimal for the GPU architecture
// Consider using half-precision if accuracy allows, to reduce memory bandwidth and storage
