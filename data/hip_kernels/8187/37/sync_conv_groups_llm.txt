```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to reduce memory transactions
// Implement warp-level primitives for efficient data exchange within a warp
// Prefetch data into shared memory to minimize global memory latency
// Optimize thread block size and grid configuration to maximize occupancy
// Align data structures to natural boundaries to avoid misaligned memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for compute-intensive sections to reduce instruction overhead
