```cpp
// Use a grid-stride loop to improve performance on large arrays
// Access memory in a coalesced manner by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Employ shared memory if data reuse is possible between threads
// Consider adjusting block size and grid size based on the GPU architecture for optimal performance
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if applicable to help the compiler with optimization
