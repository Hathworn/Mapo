```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for d_bidx and d_sums to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store data from d_xi4 and d_pxi4 if possible, reducing global memory access latency.
// Ensure d_bidx and d_sums are aligned to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Try to minimize divergence by organizing threads that follow the same execution path together.
