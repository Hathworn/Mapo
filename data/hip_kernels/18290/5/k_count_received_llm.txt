// Use shared memory to temporarily store d_n_recv_by_block to further reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if appropriate to improve performance for this specific case
// Ensure proper alignment of memory access to enhance coalescing
// Analyze and adjust block size for optimal occupancy and performance
