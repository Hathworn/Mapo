```cpp
// Consider increasing the size of shared memory to better handle overlaps
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Use warp-shuffle operations to reduce syncthreads overhead within the block
// Precompute indices to shared memory to avoid repetitive calculations
// Use loop unrolling for calculating q_i to reduce loop overhead
// Minimize the number of conditional checks inside the loop
// Consider using texture memory for read-only access patterns
