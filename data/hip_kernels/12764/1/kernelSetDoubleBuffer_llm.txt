```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses for better performance.
// Check if shared memory can be utilized for intermediate computation to minimize global memory access.
// Analyze if using vectorized memory operations (float4 or float2) could enhance memory throughput.
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized to reduce bank conflicts.
