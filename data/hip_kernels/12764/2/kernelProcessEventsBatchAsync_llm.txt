```
// Consider increasing MAX_SHARED_GPU_EVENTS to improve data locality and reduce global memory accesses.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers like gpuEventsX and gpuEventsY to hint the compiler about non-overlapping accesses.
// Ensure coalesced access in loading events into shared memory by aligning globalEventIdx calculations.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by reducing contention on gpuBuffer; try a thread block-level strategy.
// Prefetch data from global to shared memory with efficient access patterns to avoid memory divergence.
// Align the shared memory usage optimally to avoid bank conflicts during memory reads/writes.
// Investigate whether loop unrolling for eventReadsPerThread can further optimize performance.
