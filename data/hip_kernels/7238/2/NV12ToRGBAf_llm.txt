```
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed chroma data to improve cache efficiency
// Use texture memory if the input image data is read-only for better cache locality
// Try coalesced memory access patterns in global for each memory read/write operation
// Consider using half precision if it meets precision requirements to speed up computations
// Align memory accesses to enable vectorized loading/storing
