```
// Use shared memory to cache srcImage data for faster access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning srcImage and dstImage accesses.
// Consider using texture or surface memory for srcImage to leverage hardware interpolation features.
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the use of temporary variables in hot paths.
// Use warp-level primitives to further optimize chroma data processing.
// Explore using asynchronous memory copies to overlap data transfer with computation.
// Investigate the use of inline PTX to optimize specific low-level operations.
// Group similar operations to enable compiler optimizations like loop unrolling.
