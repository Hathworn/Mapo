// Use shared memory to speed up memory access when possible  
// Ensure memory coalescing by adjusting the memory access patterns  
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing common results in local variables  
// Use texture memory for input data if it offers performance benefits  
// Minimize global memory access by loading data into registers when appropriate  
// Consider atomic operations carefully for possible performance impacts  
// Align memory access to improve memory throughput
