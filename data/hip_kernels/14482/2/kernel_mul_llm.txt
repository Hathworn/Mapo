```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for 'first' and 'second'
// Ensure memory access patterns align with warp boundaries for better efficiency
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable
