```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring threads execute similar paths
// Access global memory coalesced to improve memory throughput
// Load frequently accessed data into registers to reduce memory access time
// Reduce the number of memory transactions by aligning data accesses
```
