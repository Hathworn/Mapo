```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for 'newB', 'first', and 'second' arrays.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory access.
// Implement double buffering if data dependency allows it.
// Evaluate warp divergence and restructure conditional logic to improve execution efficiency.
// Minimize use of atomics by restructuring data dependency or using reduction methods.
