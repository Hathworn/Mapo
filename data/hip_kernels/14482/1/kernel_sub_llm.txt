```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches by reordering conditions if possible
// Consider using shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory accesses
// Precompute repeated values outside of the loop to reduce redundant computations
// Align data structures to natural boundaries for better memory performance
// Utilize vectorized operations when handling data in the kernel if possible
