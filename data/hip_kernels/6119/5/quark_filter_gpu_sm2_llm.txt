```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_hash by aligning data structures or adjusting thread use
// Use shared memory if possible to further reduce global memory accesses for d_hash
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable for operations on d_branch2 and d_NonceBranch
// Ensure d_branch2 and d_NonceBranch accesses are coalesced to optimize memory throughput
// Minimize use of global memory by storing intermediary results in registers
// If atomic operations are needed, ensure minimal contention for d_NonceBranch
