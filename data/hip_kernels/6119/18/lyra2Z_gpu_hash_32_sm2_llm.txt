```cpp
// Optimize kernel launch for better occupancy and warp utilization
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Synchronize threads after loading to ensure all data is in shared memory before use
// Compute using shared memory to minimize latency due to slower global memory access
// Use atomic operations when writing to global memory to prevent race conditions
```
