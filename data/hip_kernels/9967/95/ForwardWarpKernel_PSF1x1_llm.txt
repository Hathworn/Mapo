```
// Load values once to registers to reduce memory operations
// Use shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns if possible
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for additional performance benefits
// Minimize divergence by properly managing conditional execution paths
