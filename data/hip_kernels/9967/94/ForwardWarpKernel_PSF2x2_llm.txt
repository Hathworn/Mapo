// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for better memory access patterns.
// Consider vectorizing memory accesses with float4 operations, if applicable.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures accordingly.
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data like src to improve memory access speed.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths.
// Implement loop unrolling for constant memory operations to enhance performance.
