// Consider adjusting shared memory size for better occupancy
// Ensure memory coalescing by adjusting access patterns
// Avoid store overhead by minimizing shared memory accesses
// Utilize shared memory for repeated access data to reduce global memory transactions
// Implement additional warp-level optimizations for better efficiency
