```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning loc_ to preferred memory access patterns
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider using __ldg for read-only loc_ to utilize texture cache
// Check if __half2float can be replaced with native float operations for better performance
// Ensure that x and y are similarly accessed in a coalesced fashion
// Minimize thread divergence by organizing threads to handle consecutive data points
