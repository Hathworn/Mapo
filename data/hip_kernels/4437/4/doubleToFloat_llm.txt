// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory reads.
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within a block is possible.
// Ensure kernel launch parameters maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads.
// Evaluate if FP16 conversions or tensor cores could provide additional performance benefits.
