```cpp
// // Precompute indices to reduce redundant calculations and improve efficiency
// // Minimize pointer arithmetic by using base pointers
// // Use loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// // Access memory in a coalesced manner where possible
// // Accumulate results within the loop to reduce the number of memory accesses
