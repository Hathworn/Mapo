```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing to improve bandwidth
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit performance in low iteration loops
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Check if constant memory is suitable for the input data for faster access
