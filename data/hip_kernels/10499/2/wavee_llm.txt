```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to cache repeated global memory loads for distance calculations if possible.
// Use faster math functions like __fsqrt_rn for square root to enhance performance.
// Precompute variables that do not change inside the loop to reduce computation overhead.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to improve memory transaction efficiency.
