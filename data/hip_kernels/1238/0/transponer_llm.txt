```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if shared memory size permits
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve data throughput
// Optimize block size for better occupancy while considering shared memory usage
// Consider loop unrolling if iterations are predictable and unrolled sizes fit in register count
