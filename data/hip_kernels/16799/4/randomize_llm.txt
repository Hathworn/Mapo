```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when reading and writing rand[tid]
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are configured to maximize warp utilization
// Prefetch rand[tid] into a register before using it
// Minimize divergent branches within the randomize kernel
