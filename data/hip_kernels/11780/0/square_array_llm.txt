// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access time
// Load data into shared memory to avoid repeated global memory reads
// Synchronize all threads after loading to ensure shared memory is populated
// Perform computation using shared memory for faster processing
// Synchronize again before writing back to ensure consistency
// Write back to global memory only after computation is complete
