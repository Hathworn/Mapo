// Consider using shared memory for 'values' and 'colIdx' to reduce global memory access latency
// Use memory coalescing techniques for accessing arrays 'x' and 'y'
// Ensure thread synchronization is minimized to avoid unnecessary stalls
// Look into minimizing usage of __syncthreads() to enhance parallel efficiency
