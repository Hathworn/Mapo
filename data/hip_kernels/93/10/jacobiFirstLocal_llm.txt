```
// Consider utilizing shared memory for commonly accessed arrays to improve memory access speed.
// Reduce branch divergence by unrolling the error check loop if iteration count is fixed or predictable.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize register usage by reusing variables and avoiding unnecessary declarations.
// Adjust block size to maximize occupancy while maintaining efficient memory access patterns.
