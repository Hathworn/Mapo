```cpp
// Optimize: Consider minimizing shared memory size by reducing matrix dimensions if possible
// Optimize: Preload diagonal and non-diagonal values into registers to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize: Use loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase throughput
// Optimize: Use coalesced memory accesses when reading and writing to global memory
// Optimize: Ensure warp divergence is minimized during branching
// Optimize: Consider using float2 or float4 for non-diagonal values for efficient memory access
// Optimize: Align data structures to meet memory coalescing requirements
// Optimize: Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls if possible
```
