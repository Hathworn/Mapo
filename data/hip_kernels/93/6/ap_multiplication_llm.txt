// Ensure coalesced memory access by reorganizing data structures
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Minimize divergent branching for better parallel efficiency
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory access latency
// Attempt loop unrolling for potential performance gains
