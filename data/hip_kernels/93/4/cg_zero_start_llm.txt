```
// Optimize memory access by using offset calculations to reduce blockIdx.x usage
// Prefer accessing contiguous memory locations to improve memory coalescing
// Use shared memory to temporarily store computational results and reduce global memory access
// Reduce warp divergence by using single thread synchronization for reduction operations
// Ensure atomic operations for shared memory updates to avoid race conditions
```
