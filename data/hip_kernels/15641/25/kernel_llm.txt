```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning array access patterns
// Optimize block and thread allocation for better resource utilization
// Minimize control flow divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
```
