// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider aligning memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Implement additional loop unrolling for smaller warp sizes to enhance efficiency
// Prefer atomic operations on shared memory for performance gains in certain contexts
// Employ occupancy calculator to verify optimal block size and resource utilization
