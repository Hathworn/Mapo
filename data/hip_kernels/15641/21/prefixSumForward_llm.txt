```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal performance
// Minimize warp divergence by structuring conditions efficiently
// Attempt to use shared memory for frequently accessed data 
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize threads when needed
// Consider loop unrolling for deeper execution pipelining
// Profile memory bandwidth to identify further optimization potential
```
