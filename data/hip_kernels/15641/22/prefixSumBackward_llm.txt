// Avoid redundant memory access by combining index calculations
// Use boundary checks early to minimize unnecessary computations
// Store index calculations in variables to reduce redundant arithmetic operations
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure alignment for optimal access patterns in global memory
