// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for a and b to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure shared memory arrays use bank conflict avoidance strategies by padding the memory.
// Explore potential for loop unrolling in the inner computation loop to optimize performance.
// Validate that __syncthreads() usage is appropriate and necessary to synchronize threads.
// Investigate if the kernel launch parameters are optimal for the given hardware architecture.
