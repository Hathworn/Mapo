```c
// Use shared memory to improve memory access speed
// Coalesce global memory accesses for optimal performance
// Minimize the number of registers used by focusing on key variables
// Optimize for bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Ensure loop unrolling is appropriate and does not increase register pressure
// Consider using warp-level primitives to enhance performance
```
