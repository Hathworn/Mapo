// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for kernel values
// Ensure that thread index calculations reuse existing data in registers to minimize redundant calculations
// Utilize __syncthreads() effectively to ensure all threads have loaded the shared data before proceeding
// Compute thread index efficiently by avoiding non-essential complex operations
// Merge conditional checks to minimize branching and ensure continuous flow
