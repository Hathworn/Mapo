```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Add padding to shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Load entire tiles into shared memory to maximize coalesced access
// Synchronize threads after loading data to ensure all data is available
// Transpose data using shared memory to reduce accesses to slow global memory
// Store transposed data back to global memory with coalesced writes
