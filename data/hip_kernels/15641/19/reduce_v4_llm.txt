```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Minimize global memory accesses by utilizing shared memory
// Utilize warp-synchronous operations to reduce synchronization overhead
// Implement loop unrolling for the reduction step to increase performance
// Consider tiling strategies to exploit more data reuse in shared memory
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns
