```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by processing a warp at a time.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns further to reduce bank conflicts.
// Align data structures to cache line size for efficient processing.
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency.
