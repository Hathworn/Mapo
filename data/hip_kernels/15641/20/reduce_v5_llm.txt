// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory reads by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Leverage warp-level operations to minimize thread divergence
// Reduce synchronization overhead by optimizing shared memory operations
// Consider unrolling additional reduction steps for performance improvement
