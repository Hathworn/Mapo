```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded before proceeding
// Use shared memory for transpose to improve memory access patterns
// Check boundary conditions to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
