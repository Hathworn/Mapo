```
// Ensure coalesced memory access where possible to improve memory throughput
// Leverage shared memory if necessary to further optimize memory access patterns
// Consider using wider memory accesses (e.g., float4) to reduce the number of transactions
// Minimize divergence by aligning branch conditions within warp boundaries
// Always check the impact of loop unrolling, as very large unrolls can lead to register pressure
// Analyze if further unrolling or loop fission could benefit based on hardware specifics
