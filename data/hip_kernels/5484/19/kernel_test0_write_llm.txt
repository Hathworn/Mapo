```c
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory access patterns.
// Ensure memory writes are aligned to improve performance and prevent bank conflicts.
// Verify that block and thread sizes are optimal for the hardware architecture.
// Use shared memory if appropriate to reduce global memory traffic.
// Analyze occupancy to make sure kernel configuration is maximizing hardware utilization.
