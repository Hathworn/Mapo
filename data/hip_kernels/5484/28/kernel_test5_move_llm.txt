// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency
// Utilize shared memory to further reduce global memory access if beneficial
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead
// Consider adjusting block size to match the warp size for optimal performance
// Evaluate the potential benefit of loop unrolling to enhance execution speed
