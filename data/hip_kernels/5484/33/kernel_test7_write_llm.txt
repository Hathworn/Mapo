// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory wherever possible
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access within warps
// Minimize the number of instructions inside critical loops
// Optimize thread-block dimensions based on shared memory limitations
