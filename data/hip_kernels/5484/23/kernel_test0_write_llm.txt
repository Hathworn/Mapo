```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning pointers appropriately
// Minimize warp divergence by checking conditions outside loops when possible
// Reduce bank conflicts by using appropriate stride between writes
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Consider loop unrolling if loop iterations are known at compile time
// Align memory accesses to natural boundaries to improve memory throughput
```
