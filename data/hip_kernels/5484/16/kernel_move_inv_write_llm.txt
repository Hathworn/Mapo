```
// Use coalesced memory accesses where possible to maximize memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts and ensure optimal performance
// Evaluate the impact of memory access patterns on performance
// Ensure that all threads in a warp access memory efficiently
// Consider occupancy limits and adjust thread and block configurations
// Use proper synchronization techniques if accessing shared memory
