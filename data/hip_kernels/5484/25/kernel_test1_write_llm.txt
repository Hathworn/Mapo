```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider using vectorized data types for memory write operations
// Optimize block size and grid size for better latency hiding and occupancy
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory if applicable
// Ensure memory alignment to avoid inefficient memory transactions
```
