```c
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Avoid warp divergence by minimizing conditional statements within the kernel
// Optimize memory bandwidth by using shared memory if possible
// Use appropriate block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy
// Consider using vectorized data types for better memory throughput
