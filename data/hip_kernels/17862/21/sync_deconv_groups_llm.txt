```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to optimize memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize register usage to enhance occupancy and parallelism
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized to improve execution efficiency
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency
