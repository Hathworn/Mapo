// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Minimize the use of atomic operations where possible
// Reevaluate grid and block dimensions for better occupancy
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Analyze and optimize memory usage for better cache utilization
