```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns when accessing devDiff by reorganizing data layout.
// Use float4 or float2 types for reading devDiff when nClusters is a multiple of 4 or 2 for better memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure all data stored in shared memory can fit within the size limits to avoid bank conflicts.
// Pre-fetch values that will be reused in registers outside the loop to reduce memory access latency.
// Utilize shared memory more effectively by loading values that will be reused across threads in a block.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by grouping multiple operations together where possible.
// Explore the possibility of using warp-level primitives to reduce atomic contention at the block level.
// Evaluate occupancy rates to ensure efficient use of streaming multiprocessors and adjust block size accordingly.
