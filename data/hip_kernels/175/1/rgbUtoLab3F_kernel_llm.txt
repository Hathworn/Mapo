```
// Use bit manipulations directly and precompute division to reduce computational overhead.
// Inline powf for gamma correction to avoid multiple function calls.
// Pre-defined constants moved for optimization to facilitate memory access and reuse.
// Normalize using precomputed constants to decrease the number of operations.
// Ternary operations simplified by inline ternary comparisons to enhance condition evaluation efficiency.
// Compute Lab values; avoid repeated computations and improve readability for better performance.
