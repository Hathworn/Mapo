```
// Consider using shared memory for smaller values of nPoints to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced access to devDiff by having threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Preload devDiff values into registers to minimize repeated memory fetches.
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling in scenarios with small nClusters.
// Consider organizing data to ensure better cache utilization in devClusters.
// Use warp shuffles to minimize synchronization when aggregating results across threads.
