```cpp
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to maximize occupancy
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for localMasses and localCounts
// Avoid using atomic functions in a loop to minimize contention and improve performance
// Use coalesced memory accesses for the 'responses' and 'cluster' arrays
// Eliminate unnecessary __syncthreads() if there's no data dependency
```
