```
// Use shared memory for faster access to frequently used data
// Employ direct index calculation to minimize arithmetic operations in memory access
// Utilize min function for boundary checks to avoid out-of-bound errors
// Accumulate results from shared memory to reduce global memory writes
// Ensure only one thread per block writes back to global memory to avoid data races
