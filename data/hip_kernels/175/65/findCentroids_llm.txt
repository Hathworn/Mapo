// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate the possibility of minimizing atomic operations by structuring the data differently.
// Investigate if loop unrolling can benefit performance in tightly coupled loops.
// Assess shared memory bank conflicts and reorganize data to reduce them if necessary.
// Explore double buffering to hide memory latency effects in responses processing.
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is necessary as it can introduce performance overhead if used excessively.
