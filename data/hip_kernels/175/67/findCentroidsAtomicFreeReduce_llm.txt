```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve performance
// Accumulate intermediate results in shared memory before writing back to global memory
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() to coordinate shared memory usage
// Limit global memory writes by consolidating shared memory results before storage
