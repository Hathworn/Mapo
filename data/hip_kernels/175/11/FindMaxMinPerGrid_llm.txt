```
// Consider using float4 for coalesced global memory access
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointer arguments to help the compiler with optimizations
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for reduction within a warp to enhance performance
// Consider reducing the use of __syncthreads() where redundant to reduce synchronization overhead
// Utilize loop unrolling to minimize loop control overhead
```
