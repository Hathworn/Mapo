```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase memory coalescing.
// Consider using warp intrinsics for faster reductions within the thread block.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure full utilization of cache lines.
// Explore using atomic operations if concurrent memory updates are needed.
