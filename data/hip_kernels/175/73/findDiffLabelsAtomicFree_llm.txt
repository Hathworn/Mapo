// Avoid loading devDiff[index] repeatedly by using a local variable instead
// Consider using shared memory for devDiff access to reduce global memory latency
// Coalesce memory access for devClusters[x] to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing control flow efficiently
