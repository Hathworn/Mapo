```
// Use coalesced memory access for 'responses' to improve memory efficiency.
// Align shared memory usage and allocation to avoid bank conflicts.
// Replace shared memory initialization with parallelized thread operations.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize intra-warp reduction in shared memory.
// Minimize global memory writes by combining 'centroidMass' and 'centroidCount' updates.
