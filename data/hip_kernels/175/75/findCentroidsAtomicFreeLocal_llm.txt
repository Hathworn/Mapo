```
// Optimize the use of shared memory according to actual data size
// Consider merging shared memory declarations if beneficial
// Adjust shared memory allocation based on expected occupancy & blockDim
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced accesses to global memory for filter_responses
// Consider loop unrolling for accumulating local responses and count
// Use cooperative groups for more efficient intra-block reductions
// Regularly check if shared memory size exceeds hardware limits
// Optimize pixel_end calculation to reduce branch divergence
