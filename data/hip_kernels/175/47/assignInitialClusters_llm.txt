```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use constant memory for data that does not change and fits in the cache
// Load data in coalesced manner to improve memory access patterns
// Precompute frequently used expressions to minimize redundant calculations
// Utilize warp-level programming to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use vector types for memory access to minimize instructions
```
