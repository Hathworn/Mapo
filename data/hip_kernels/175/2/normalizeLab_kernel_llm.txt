```cpp
// Use shared memory to store devL, devA, and devB data for better memory access patterns.
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize global memory access by loading data into registers when used in computations.
// Validate memory alignment to ensure efficient memory transactions.
