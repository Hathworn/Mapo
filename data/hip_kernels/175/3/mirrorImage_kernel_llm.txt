```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for devInput to reduce global memory access.
// Align memory accesses to increase coalescing and reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Use texture memory for devInput if it offers better caching behavior.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to improve resource utilization.
