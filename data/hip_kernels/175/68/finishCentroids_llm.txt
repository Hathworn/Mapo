```c
// Optimize memory access patterns with coalesced reads for centroidMass and centroidCount.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses by storing frequently accessed data.
// Consider using float2 or float4 vector types for centroids to increase memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution to optimize performance.
// Precompute indices to reduce redundant calculations inside the kernel.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for target architecture.
