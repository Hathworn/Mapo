```
// Consider aligning memory access to avoid misaligned reads and writes for better performance.
// Use coalesced memory accesses when reading centroidMass and centroidCount to maximize memory throughput.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by employing warp-level or block-level reduction patterns.
// Avoid redundant synchronization barriers (__syncthreads()) to reduce overhead and improve performance.
// Prefer shared memory for intermediate operations to reduce global memory traffic.
// Evaluate grid and block dimensions to maximize warp utilization and ensure efficient thread usage.
