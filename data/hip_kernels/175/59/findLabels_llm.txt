```
// Optimize memory access by loading centroids into shared memory
// Consider coalesced memory access for the responses array
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory transactions
// Minimize the divergence of threads within a warp
// Ensure that access to sharedCentroids is coalesced to improve memory efficiency
// Use atomic operations efficiently to reduce contention
