```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing loads from global memory.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for shared data.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler with optimization.
// Ensure that grid and block dimensions are optimized for the given GPU architecture.
