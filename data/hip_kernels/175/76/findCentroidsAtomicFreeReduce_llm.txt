```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses by accumulating local results before storing them.
// Avoid divergent condition checks for better warp execution efficiency.
// Utilize cooperative thread reduction to minimize synchronization overhead for shared memory usage.
// Decorrelate loop iterations from block dimensions to prevent thread divergence.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce computation time.
