```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when writing to the 'cluster' array
// Precompute values that are used multiple times to reduce instruction overhead
// Place frequently used constants in registers to minimize memory access latency
// Use __float2int_rn intrinsic for precise and efficient floating-point to integer conversion
// Adjust block size for better occupancy and workload distribution
