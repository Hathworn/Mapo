```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure warp-wide operations on shared memory to minimize bank conflicts.
// Perform atomic operations on shared memory for reduced contention compared to global memory.
// Combine synchronization points to minimize redundant __syncthreads calls.
// Minimize index calculations by leveraging loop unrolling techniques.
// Optimize atomic operations by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns.
