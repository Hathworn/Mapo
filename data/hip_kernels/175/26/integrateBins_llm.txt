```
// Use shared memory to load data once per row to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing when accessing devImage and devIntegrals arrays.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Minimize divergence by organizing threads to perform similar tasks.
