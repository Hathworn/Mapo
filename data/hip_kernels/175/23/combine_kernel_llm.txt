```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure enough threads per block to maximize occupancy
// Optimize pointer access by aligning data structures to avoid memory misalignment
// Use const memory for coefficients and weights if they are constant during execution
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if applied
// Align data access to warp boundaries when possible
// Evaluate if memory coalescing is achievable with current data layout
// Check if increasing block size improves register usage without excess
