```
// Consider using shared memory for lifter_coeffs if it is accessed multiple times
// Ensure memory access patterns for feats are coalesced for better performance
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider prefetching data if there is latency in memory access
```
