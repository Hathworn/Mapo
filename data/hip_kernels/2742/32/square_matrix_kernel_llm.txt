```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if applicable
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads and writes
// Utilize vectorized loads and stores if the hardware supports it
// Try loop unrolling for the inner loop if there are any
// Adjust block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and performance
