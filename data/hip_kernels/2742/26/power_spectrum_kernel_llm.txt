```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for Ar and Aw to optimize memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store matrix chunks for reducing global memory access time.
// Prefetch data into registers to hide global memory latency.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() which can lead to thread divergence and lower performance.
// Thread blocking strategies might be optimized to improve occupancy and reduce idling.
