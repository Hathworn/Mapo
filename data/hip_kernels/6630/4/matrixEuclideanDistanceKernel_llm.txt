```
// Unroll the shared memory load loop to reduce latency
// Utilize shared memory to cache input data and minimize global memory access
// Use loop unrolling to optimize the inner loop operations
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for better memory throughput
// Implement block synchronization appropriately to prevent race conditions
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce overhead
// Ensure that the block size is determined based on hardware occupancy
