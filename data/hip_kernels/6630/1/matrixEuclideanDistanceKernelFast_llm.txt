```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Loop unrolling to reduce the overhead and improve performance
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to provide compiler optimization hints for pointer aliasing
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential thread access patterns for both input and output arrays
// Prefer CUDA's fast math operations when applicable for slight performance benefits
// Evaluate using warp shuffle operations to further reduce shared memory requirements
