```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Consider using float4 for better cache utilization if data alignment allows
// Minimize shared memory usage when possible for higher occupancy
// Adjust block size (16x16) based on compute capabilities and memory constraints
// Unroll loops to reduce overhead and improve ILP
// Prefetch shared memory data to register for reuse and reduce shared memory bank conflicts
// Ensure blocks are evenly distributed across SMs for balanced workload
// Optimize register usage to avoid register spilling into local memory
