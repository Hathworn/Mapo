```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns in global memory for in_X and in_Y
// Consider using vectorized loads to further improve memory throughput
// Leverage loop unrolling to increase computational efficiency within the loop
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy and minimize memory latency
// Ensure that access to shared memory is conflict-free among threads
// Align shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider adjusting grid/block dimensions for better hardware utilization
