```
// Consider using __shared__ memory for accuracy if there are multiple divisions
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns
// Ensure memory access is in a continuous sequence for better performance
// Reduce memory bank conflicts by ensuring memory access patterns are aligned
// Minimize global memory accesses, aiming for as few accesses as possible
// Review if warp-synchronous operations could help simplify synchronization
