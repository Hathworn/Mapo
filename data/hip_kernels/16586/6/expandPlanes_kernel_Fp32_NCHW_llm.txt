```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning shared memory loads
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading to shared memory
// Minimize global memory access by utilizing shared memory effectively
// Consider increasing block size if memory bandwidth allows
// Check if blockIdx.x based prefetching could enhance performance
```
