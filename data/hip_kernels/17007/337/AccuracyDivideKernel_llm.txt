```cpp
// Check for coalesced memory access patterns for better memory access efficiency
// Ensure N is a power of 2 for optimal memory access patterns if possible
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data if necessary
// Consider the occupancy of threads per block for optimal hardware utilization
 ```
