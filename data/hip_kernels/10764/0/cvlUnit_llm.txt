```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for the core data.
// Use shared memory for tile-based processing of input images for efficient caching.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for loading imgR, imgG, and imgB to improve memory throughput.
// Unroll the innermost loop over j to exploit parallelism and reduce loop overhead.
// Use the constant memory for the core if it does not change over multiple kernel launches.
