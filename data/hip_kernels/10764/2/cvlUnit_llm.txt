// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for the core and image data.
// Consider loop unrolling for the convolution computation to improve performance.
// Align memory access patterns to leverage coalesced memory access for imgR, imgG, and imgB. 
// Use constant memory for the kernel 'core' if its size does not change, to exploit cache efficiently.
