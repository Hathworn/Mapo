```
// Consider aligning shared memory size to warp size for coalesced access
// Use multiple loads to increase utilization of memory bandwidth
// Prefetch data into registers to hide latency of global memory access
// Minimize __syncthreads usage to reduce synchronization overhead
// Optimize for branch divergence in thread execution paths
// Evaluate use of vectorized data types to enhance throughput
