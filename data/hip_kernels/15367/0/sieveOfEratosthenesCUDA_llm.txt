```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use larger blocks and more threads to increase parallelization and hiding memory latency.
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() is optimized to only where necessary to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Investigate potential benefits of loop unrolling in the sieve marking loop for better performance.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure that memory transactions are as efficient as possible.
