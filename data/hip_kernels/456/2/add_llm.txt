// Consider using shared memory if the same data is accessed multiple times by threads
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring continuous threads access continuous memory locations
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring uniform execution path for threads in a warp
// Ensure data alignment for optimized memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable and beneficial
