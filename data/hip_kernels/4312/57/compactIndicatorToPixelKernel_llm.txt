```
// Combine global memory accesses to reduce the number of transactions
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and avoid misaligned access
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by ensuring all threads in a warp take the same execution path
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory latency if access pattern allows
// Use vectorized data types if multiple elements are accessed together for better throughput
