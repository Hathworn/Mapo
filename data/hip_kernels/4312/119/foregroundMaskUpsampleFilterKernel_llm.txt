```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for threads in the same block
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning access to subsampled_mask
// Minimize variable usage in register by reducing precision where applicable
// Consider using constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data such as sigma
// Optimize loops by unrolling where possible for better instruction-level parallelism
