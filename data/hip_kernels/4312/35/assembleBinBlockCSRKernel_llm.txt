```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache diagonal blocks and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for nondiagonal_blks to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed capacity for larger block sizes or matrix dimensions
// Assess the possibility of using loop unrolling to increase performance in non-diagonal block filling
