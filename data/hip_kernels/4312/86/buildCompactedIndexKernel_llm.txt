```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring conditional paths are optimized
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for valid_indicator and compacted_index arrays
// Optimize shared memory usage for targeting different GPU architectures
