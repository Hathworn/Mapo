```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalescing of global memory accesses by maintaining continuous memory patterns.
// Minimize divergent branching by arranging threads with similar control flows together.
// Utilize texture cache for read-only data to decrease cache misses and accelerate access times.
// Tune block size to achieve optimal occupancy and throughput based on the GPU architecture.
