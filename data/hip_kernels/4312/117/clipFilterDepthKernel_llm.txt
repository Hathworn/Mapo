// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by ordering threads and memory access efficiently
// Preload depth window data using shared memory to avoid redundant texture fetches
// Optimize memory access pattern by loading values in batches
// Leverage texture caching for depth values to reduce memory latency
