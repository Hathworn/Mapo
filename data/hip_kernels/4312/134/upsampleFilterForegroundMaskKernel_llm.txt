```
// Precompute constants outside the loops to reduce redundant calculations
// Use shared memory for common calculations to reduce repeated global memory access
// Adjust shared memory size based on block dimensions to optimize memory utilization
// Unroll loops to improve instruction throughput and reduce branching
// Avoid division by zero with proper checks to ensure numerical stability
// Minimize tex2D calls by caching frequently accessed values within the scope
// Ensure memory coalescing for surf2Dwrite operations where possible
