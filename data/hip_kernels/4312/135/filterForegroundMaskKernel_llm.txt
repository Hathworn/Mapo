```
// Use texture memory for efficient neighbor pixel retrieval
// Avoid division by zero through safe addition
// Optimize boundary checks with min and max functions
// Consider shared memory for accumulation operations if necessary
// Use __float2uint_ru for converting sigma and avoid unnecessary conversions
