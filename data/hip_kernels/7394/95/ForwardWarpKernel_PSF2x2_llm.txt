```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure __forceinline__ is used for the addWeight lambda to minimize function call overhead.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, especially for image_row_offset based computations.
// Optimize access patterns to utilize the spatial locality of source data.
// Minimize atomic operations, potentially replacing them with warp-level operations if possible.
// Consider loop unrolling for the pixel processing to improve performance.
