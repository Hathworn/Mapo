```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory
// Utilize shared memory to load normalization factors if reused by multiple threads
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and memory access patterns
// Prefer using __ldg() for reading constant data such as normalization_factor
