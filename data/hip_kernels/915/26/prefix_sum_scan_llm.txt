// Consider using memory coalescing for accessing dev_main_array and dev_auxiliary_array.
// Try using shared memory for dev_auxiliary_array to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure dev_auxiliary_array is aligned to memory boundaries for faster access.
// Investigate if loop unrolling can be applied to reduce instruction overhead.
