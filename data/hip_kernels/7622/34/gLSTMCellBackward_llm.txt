```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring data access patterns align with warp size
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Minimize atomic operations if possible by redesigning data dependencies
// Ensure alignment of arrays to facilitate memory coalescing
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for increased instruction-level parallelism
// Assess possibility of using constant memory for frequently accessed variables
