```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access pattern to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Align input and output arrays to cache line boundaries
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy
