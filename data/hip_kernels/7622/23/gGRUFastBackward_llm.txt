```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better memory throughput.
// Reduce the number of redundant accesses to global memory by using shared memory or registers.
// Use appropriate synchronization methods when shared memory is used to avoid race conditions.
// Ensure that atomic operations are minimized to reduce serialization and contention overhead.
// Explore occupancy optimization by adjusting grid and block dimensions for better utilization.
// Evaluate constant memory for frequently accessed and unchanged values like b for potential speed-up.
// Revisit the conditional logic to minimize divergent branches and improve warp efficiency.
