// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning the data accesses in the threads.
// Use shared memory for data that is reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure that threads within a warp have contiguous memory access patterns.
// Check if computation can be reduced by eliminating unnecessary operations.
// Consider unrolling loops to minimize branch instructions and improve throughput.
// Investigate if occupancy can be increased by choosing appropriate block size and grid size.
// Evaluate the use of pre-fetching techniques to hide memory latency.
