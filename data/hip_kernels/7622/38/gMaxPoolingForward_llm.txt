// Use shared memory for improved memory access patterns
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like 'mask'
// Optimize global memory accesses by reordering threads for coalesced access
// Use memory prefetching to reduce latency in accessing 'in' and 'mask' arrays
// Consider utilizing warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of a loop
