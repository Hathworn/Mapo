// Consider using shared memory to cache data blocks for faster access
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data structures
// Evaluate warp divergence and minimize conditional branches
// Leverage vectorized memory operations where applicable
// Use asynchronous data transfer techniques for better overlap with computation
