```
// Consider increasing shared memory usage for coalesced global memory access
// Align shared memory usage to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use loop unrolling techniques to optimize partial sum calculation
// Minimize thread divergence by restructuring for-loop conditions
// Optimize reduction operations to use fewer __syncthreads() calls
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for improved performance
