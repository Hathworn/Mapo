```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access times
// Implement coalesced memory access pattern for global memory reads
// Prefetch data using shared memory to hide memory latency
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Optimize the use of registers by limiting complex calculations within the loop
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance where applicable
