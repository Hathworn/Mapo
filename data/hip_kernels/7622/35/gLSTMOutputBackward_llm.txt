```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns for `rowOutXW` and `rowOutSU`.
// Consider using shared memory to store partial results for `t` and `adj_val` to reduce global memory traffic.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques to further enhance memory throughput for compatible sections.
// Re-evaluate the use of `atomicAdd` on `outB` for potential performance bottlenecks in a high-contention scenario.
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency and minimize memory access latency.
