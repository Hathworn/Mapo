```
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure that the number of threads per block matches the number of columns for optimal performance
// Use shared memory if there are potential bank conflicts in row operations
// Re-evaluate the grid and block dimensions to balance the workload across streaming multiprocessors
// Check if merging multiple kernel launches can reduce overall kernel launch overhead
