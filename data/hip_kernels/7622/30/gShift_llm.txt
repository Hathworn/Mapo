```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns in global memory reads and writes.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if the data fits.
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy while minimizing warp divergence.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
