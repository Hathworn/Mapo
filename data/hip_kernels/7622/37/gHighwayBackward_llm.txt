```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Ensure out1, out2, outt are aligned for coalesced access
// Check if float4 vectorized loads/stores can be used for in1, in2, t, adj
// Evaluate benefits of loop unrolling for better ILP
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by adequate launch configuration
