// Consider coalesced memory access for sparseData and sparseIndices to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to temporarily store sparseData and sparseIndices for faster access
// Minimize branch divergence by organizing threads with similar execution paths
// Use warp shuffle operations if applicable to reduce atomic operations within a warp
