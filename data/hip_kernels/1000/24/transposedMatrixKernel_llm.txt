```
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring bank conflict-free accesses
// Check for optimal block size to maximize occupancy and memory coalescing
// Evaluate and adjust grid and block dimensions for better resource utilization
// Consider using atomic operations if concurrent write is an issue
// Analyze memory access patterns for further coalescing opportunities
// Use constant memory if applicable for frequently accessed small data
