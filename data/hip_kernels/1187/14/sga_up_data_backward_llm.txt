// Use shared memory to cache filters to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads and writes
// Minimize usage of __syncthreads() by consolidating operations
// Consider kernel launch configuration to improve occupancy
// Assess using texture memory for read-only data like filters
