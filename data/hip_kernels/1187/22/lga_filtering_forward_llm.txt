```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for bottom_data and filters arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize the calculation of fbase to minimize repeated operations
// Implement further loop unrolling beyond the current level
// Ensure memory alignment for the top_data output for better performance
