```
// Precompute repeated index calculation outside the loop to reduce redundant calculations.
// Minimize memory access by checking bounds before accessing data.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access.
// Reduce global memory accesses by optimizing index calculations.
// Avoid branching or conditional statements inside the loop whenever possible.
