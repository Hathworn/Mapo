// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block
// Consolidate pointer arithmetic outside of loops to reduce computation
// Use loop unrolling techniques to minimize loop overhead and improve performance
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to potentially improve access speed
