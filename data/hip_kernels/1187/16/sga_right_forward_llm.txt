```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to improve memory access optimizations
// Evaluate the possibility of using shared memory to cache frequently used data elements
// Unroll loops to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory if applied
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for the hardware's memory hierarchy
// Use float4 or similar data types to increase memory transaction throughput
