```
// Consider using shared memory for filters to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling for the inner loop to enhance performance and reduce loop overhead.
// Check if the use of texture memory can improve read speed for top_data.
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements if possible.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for top_data to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce repeated memory accesses.
