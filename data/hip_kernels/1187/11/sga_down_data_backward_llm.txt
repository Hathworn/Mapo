// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize redundant calculations in index computations.
// Pre-fetch filter values into registers where possible.
// Unroll loops to enhance parallel efficiency.
// Align memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts and improve coalescing.
// Utilize __restrict__ qualifiers to inform the compiler about non-aliasing pointers.
