```
// Combine boundary check with index usage to reduce branching overhead
// Cache memory access to top_temp[index] to improve memory access efficiency
// Use shared memory if pattern of access exhibits spatial or temporal locality
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction operations if applicable
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve global memory bandwidth utilization
