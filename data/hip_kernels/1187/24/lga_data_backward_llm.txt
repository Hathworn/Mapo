```cpp
// Consider the use of shared memory to load and share data among threads to minimize global memory access.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied to reduce the loop overhead and improve performance.
// Assess if memory coalescing is possible to enhance the efficiency of global memory transactions.
// Check if leveraging texture memory for read-only data may provide performance benefits.
// Analyze if using constant memory for frequently accessed data, like the filters and location calculations, can increase efficiency.
