```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for bottom_data and temp_diff.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data for bottom_data and temp_diff.
// Consider using vectorized operations if applicable to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that filters_diff is written with minimal warp divergence.
// Attempt to reduce the number of calculations inside the loop by using pre-computed variables.
// Evaluate loop unrolling further to optimize for different GPU architectures.
