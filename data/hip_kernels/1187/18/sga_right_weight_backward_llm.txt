// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for better access speed
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Utilize warp shuffle techniques to minimize thread divergence
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper memory alignment
