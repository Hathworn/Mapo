```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for top_diff and bottom_diff.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like filters.
// Reduce redundant calculations for indices like base and fbase.
// Minimize divergent branches in warp execution by rearranging conditions.
// Investigate potential loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for the memory hierarchy.
