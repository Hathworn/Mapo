```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for top_diff and bottom_diff arrays
// Optimize memory access patterns for the filters array by using shared memory
// Minimize warp divergence by reordering conditional checks
// Use atomic operations if necessary for concurrent updates to bottom_diff
// Pre-fetch data where possible to hide memory latency
// Consider splitting kernel if register pressure becomes a bottleneck
// Tune block and grid sizes to improve occupancy
