// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Reorganize data access patterns to ensure memory coalescing in global memory access
// Use half precision or other data compression techniques if precision requirements permit
// Optimize the use of atomic operations to reduce contention and improve performance
