```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access and increase memory bandwidth.
// Ensure alignment of memory access to enable coalesced access patterns, particularly for loading flow and image data.
// Use texture memory for read-only access to improve cache utilization in operations with high spatial locality.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could be beneficial for reducing control overhead in pixel operations.
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives for reducing synchronization overhead in atomic operations.
