```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Align memory accesses within the same warp to prevent bank conflicts
// Consider adjusting TILE_DIM and BLOCK_ROWS for optimal performance on specific hardware
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used correctly to synchronize threads within the block
// Check for optimal grid and block size configurations to maximize occupancy
