```
// Use 64-bit index calculations to support large arrays
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads from global memory
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storing to reduce global memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure proper thread synchronization if operations involve shared data
```
