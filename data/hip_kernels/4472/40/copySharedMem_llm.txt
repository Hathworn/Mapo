// Use coalesced memory accesses when loading the data into shared memory
// Ensure shared memory writes are coalesced to optimize performance
// Consider using vectorized loads for better memory throughput
// Adjust TILE_DIM and BLOCK_ROWS to align with warp size for efficiency
// Minimize unnecessary __syncthreads calls to reduce synchronization overhead
