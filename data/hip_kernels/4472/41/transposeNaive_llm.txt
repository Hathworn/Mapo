```
// Load data efficiently utilizing coalesced memory access
// Minimize bank conflicts by using shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block
// Reduce global memory transactions by accessing data from shared memory
// Optimize for warp execution by ensuring enough parallel threads
// Consider loop unrolling for the data load/store operations
// Ensure TILE_DIM and BLOCK_ROWS are optimal for target hardware
