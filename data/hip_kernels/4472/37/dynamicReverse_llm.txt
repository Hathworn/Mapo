```
// Utilize coalesced memory access to reduce global memory transactions.
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy if shared memory allows.
// Ensure that shared memory bank conflicts are minimized.
// Prefetch data to shared memory using loop unrolling if possible.
// Implement further latency hiding techniques by overlapping computation with data transfer.
