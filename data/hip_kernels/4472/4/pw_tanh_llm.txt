```
// Consider coalesced memory access for array 'a' to improve performance
// Use __ldg() to load data from global memory if applicable to take advantage of texture cache
// Allocate enough shared memory based on the block size to avoid bank conflicts
// Use warp shuffle operations if shared memory usage is excessive for reduction operations
