```
// Use coalesced memory access pattern to improve memory throughput
// Minimize conditional statements inside kernels for better warp efficiency
// Consider shared memory for frequently accessed data if applicable
// Ensure data alignment for better performance
// Reduce use of printf in kernels inside performance-critical sections
// Align data with memory transactions to improve efficiency
