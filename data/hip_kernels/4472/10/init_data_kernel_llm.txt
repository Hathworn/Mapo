```c
// Using a stride loop improves memory access patterns
// Ensures coalesced memory access by distributing threads across data
// Reduces thread divergence by maintaining uniform workload per thread
// Memory access is more predictable, leading to better cache utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts by structuring data access patterns appropriately
```
