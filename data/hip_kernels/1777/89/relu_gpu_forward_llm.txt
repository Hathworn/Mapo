```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning memory access patterns
// Use shared memory if in/out arrays involve multiple accesses
// Load data from global memory to registers for reuse within a thread
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance
// Profile memory access patterns to identify bottlenecks
```
