// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory where applicable to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Restructure condition checks to avoid bank conflicts and achieve better warp utilization.
// Explore the possibility of loop unrolling in the `uniq` function to enhance performance.
// Analyze the access pattern for `M` and perhaps reorganize data to fit better into cache lines.
// Investigate the use of warp shuffle techniques to eliminate idle threads and enhance performance.
