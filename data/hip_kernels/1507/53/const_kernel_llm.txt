```
// Ensure memory coalescing by optimizing the data access pattern.
// Use larger thread blocks for efficient memory access.
// Consider using shared memory for frequent global memory accesses.
// Avoid warp divergence for better performance.
// Minimize memory transactions by improving access patterns.
