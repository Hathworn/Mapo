// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access for weights array.
// Utilize shared memory to cache mean_arr_gpu values within a block to minimize global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for operations inside kernel to reduce instruction overhead.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes to maximize GPU resource utilization.
// Implement profiling to identify memory bottlenecks and adjust code structure accordingly.
