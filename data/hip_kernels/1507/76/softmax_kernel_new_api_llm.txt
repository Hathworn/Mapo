```cpp
// Optimize id calculation to eliminate redundant multiplications
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads read sequential memory locations
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching to hide latency for input and output data
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring that threads within a warp follow the same execution path
```
