// Consider using shared memory for coalesced memory access to enhance performance.
// Align the data structure to minimize memory misalignment and improve throughput.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for src and dst pointers to aid compiler optimizations.
// Balance the grid and block dimensions to better fit the GPU architecture.
