// Ensure thread utilization is maximized by optimal block and grid sizing
// Consider shared memory usage for data accessed by multiple threads to reduce global memory access
// Utilize coalesced memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads access contiguous memory locations
// Evaluate trade-offs between atomic operations versus potential synchronization overhead
// Explore data reuse strategies, such as caching frequently accessed data in registers or shared memory
