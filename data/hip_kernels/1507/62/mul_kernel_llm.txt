```
// Use shared memory for X and Y values within a block to improve memory access speeds.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for both X and Y to improve memory bandwidth.
// Assess if reducing INCX and INCY strides could lead to better coalescing and reduced memory divergence.
// Analyze if loop unrolling can enhance performance for this kernel by reducing overhead.
