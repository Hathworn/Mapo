```
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns
// Promote shared memory usage where feasible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that loop unrolling leverages vectorized memory operations if applicable
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further enhance parallel efficiency
