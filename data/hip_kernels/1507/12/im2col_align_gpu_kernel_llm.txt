```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache commonly accessed data_im_ptr if necessary
// Consider unrolling the inner loop for ksize to improve instruction throughput
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for both data_im and data_col
// Eliminate redundant calculations and reuse computed indices
// Align data accesses on 32-byte boundaries to optimize memory transactions
```
