// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within the block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve global memory efficiency.
// Minimize branch divergence by simplifying conditional statements, if possible.
// Align memory accesses to 128-byte boundaries to enhance memory throughput.
