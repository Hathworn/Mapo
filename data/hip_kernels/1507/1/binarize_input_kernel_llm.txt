```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for mean calculation
// Perform thread synchronization carefully to ensure data consistency
// Optimize and unroll loops where possible for better performance
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for improved bandwidth utilization
// Consider using atomic operations if needed during reduction
// Minimize thread divergence by avoiding branches where possible
```
