```
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate the possibility of shared memory to store partial sums for better memory access patterns
// Assess the use of loop unrolling within the for-loop to reduce overhead and increase throughput
// Investigate the impact of varying block size to balance the workload and maximize occupancy
// Analyze the benefit of using atomic operations if concurrent writes to output are a potential issue
