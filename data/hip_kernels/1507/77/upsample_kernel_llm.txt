// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance
// Align the accessed memory to the warp size if possible
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by padding shared memory arrays
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data for higher bandwidth
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on occupancy calculator results
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations and their impact on performance
