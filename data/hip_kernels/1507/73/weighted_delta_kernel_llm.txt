```
// Reduce global memory access by storing dc[i] and s[i] into local variables
// Leverage data reuse by accessing cached dc_val and s_val instead of global memory
// Ensure operations occur on local variables to minimize global memory interaction
// Check validity of pointers (e.g., da) before performing operations to prevent unnecessary reads
// Optimize calculation by minimizing redundant loading of data from memory
