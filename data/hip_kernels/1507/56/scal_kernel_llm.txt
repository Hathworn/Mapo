// Ensure coalesced memory access by using proper indexing
// Consider using shared memory to cache values for reuse and reduced global memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by properly organizing data
// Use vectorized data types if applicable to enhance memory transaction efficiency
// Evaluate using pinned memory for faster data transfer between host and device
// Optimize stride and block size for better occupancy and performance
