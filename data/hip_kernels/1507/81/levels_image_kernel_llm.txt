```
// Consider using shared memory for 'rand' as it is accessed multiple times
// Utilize __restrict__ pointers to reduce pointer aliasing
// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'image' array by aligning and structuring data
// Preload common variables such as 'offset' and 'idx' to reduce recomputation latency
// Optimize operations with constant values like '0.5f' using precalculation
// Utilize warp-level primitives for potential shared computations among threads
