```
// Consider using shared memory to stage data before writing to re_packed_input to optimize for memory coalescing.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access by padding shared array if needed.
// Ensure all memory transfers are coalesced by aligning data properly and accessing in a sequential manner.
// Reorganize data access patterns to ensure that warps access continuous memory to maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate using vectorized operations for packing/unpacking to utilize higher memory bandwidth and improve performance.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
