```
// Utilize shared memory to store frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses in a way that adjacent threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring that threads access different memory banks
// Implement pre-fetching to overlap computation and memory operations, reducing idle time waiting for memory
