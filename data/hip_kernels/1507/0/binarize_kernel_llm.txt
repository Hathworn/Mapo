```
// Consider coalesced memory access by using optimal data alignment for x and binary
// Ensure n is a multiple of the warp size to maximize warp utilization
// Utilize shared memory if the binary results are used multiple times
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit performance by further optimizing boundary checks
// Balance the number of threads and blocks to hide latency and maximize occupancy
