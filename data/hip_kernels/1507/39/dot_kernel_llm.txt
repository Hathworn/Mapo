```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for threads within the same block
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory access efficiency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit performance in inner loops
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring uniform control paths within a warp
// Minimize the use of sqrtf by computing and storing its result if accessed multiple times
