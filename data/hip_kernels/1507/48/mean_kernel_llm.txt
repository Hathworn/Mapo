// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads from global memory.  
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loops to reduce instruction overhead.
// Adjust shared memory usage to ensure optimal occupancy and prevent bank conflicts.  
// Utilize warp-level intrinsics to optimize reduction within shared memory.
