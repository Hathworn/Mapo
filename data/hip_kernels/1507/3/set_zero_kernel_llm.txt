```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory if reuse of data is frequent
// Align data in memory to reduce unaligned accesses
// Optimize block and thread dimensions for the specific hardware
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Reduce the number of kernel launches by fusing kernels if possible
