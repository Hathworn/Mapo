```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed weights to reduce global memory access.
// Unroll inner loops further if register pressure allows, focusing on reducing the overhead of loop control.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the input data to utilize the memory bandwidth efficiently.
// Use constant memory for weights if they are reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure that all memory accesses are aligned to improve performance and avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous copies to or from shared memory to hide memory latency.
