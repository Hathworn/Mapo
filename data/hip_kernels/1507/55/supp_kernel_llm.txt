```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Consider coalescing memory access for better performance
// Ensure memory access patterns maximize use of memory bandwidth
// Experiment with different block and grid size configurations
// Optimize instruction throughput by minimizing warp divergence
```
