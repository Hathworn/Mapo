// Ensure __restrict__ keyword is used on pointer arguments for potential pointer aliasing benefits
// Consider using shared memory to temporarily store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access pattern by ensuring threads access memory in a coalesced manner
// Avoid branching within threads as much as possible to maintain warp efficiency
