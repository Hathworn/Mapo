```
// Consider coalesced memory access for delta and prev_delta arrays
// Pre-compute expressions that are used multiple times to reduce overall operations
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve global memory throughput
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better hardware utilization
// Prefetch data to registers where possible to hide memory latency
