```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads from global memory.
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data and reduce repeated access.
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Ensure the use of registers by using pragma unroll for small, fixed-size loops.
