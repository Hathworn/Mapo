```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to data_col for better global memory efficiency.
// Ensure that data_im is accessed contiguously for optimal memory performance.
// Check if prefetching techniques can be applied to reduce global memory latency.
// Analyze the possibility of using shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns.
