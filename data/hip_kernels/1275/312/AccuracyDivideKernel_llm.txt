// Optimization: Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Optimization: Reduce global memory accesses by storing intermediate results
// Optimization: Minimize latency by ensuring data is coalesced when reading/writing
// Optimization: Use constant memory for values that do not change during execution
