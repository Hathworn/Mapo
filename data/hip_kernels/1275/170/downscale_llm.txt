```
// Consider loop unrolling for better control flow and improved performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access by utilizing shared memory if possible
// Optimize index calculations to reduce modulo and division operations
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to aid compiler optimizations
// Evaluate the possibility of replacing global memory accesses with local variables to reduce latency
