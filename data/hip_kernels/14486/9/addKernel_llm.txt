```
// Use a stride loop to improve memory coalescing.
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance performance.
