```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for global memory reads
// Favor warp-level synchronization over block-level synchronization where possible
// Consider tiling technique to further optimize shared memory usage
// Analyze if loop unrolling could benefit performance in this context
// Evaluate thread block and grid configuration for better occupancy
