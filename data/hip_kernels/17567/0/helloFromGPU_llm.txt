// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in memory  
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency  
// Minimize divergent warps by ensuring condition statements are executed by all threads  
// Leverage constant memory for frequently accessed data  
// Apply loop unrolling techniques for better performance if applicable  
// Consider using asynchronous memory copies for efficient data transfer between host and device
