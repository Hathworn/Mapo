```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring that threads within a block access contiguous memory locations
// Evaluate using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses
// Check for opportunities to reduce divergence by ensuring uniform code execution among threads
// Analyze the possibility of loop unrolling if applicable to minimize overhead
// Assess the use of warp-level primitives for reducing atomics overhead where possible
// Investigate vectorizing computations to optimize throughput on SIMD architectures
