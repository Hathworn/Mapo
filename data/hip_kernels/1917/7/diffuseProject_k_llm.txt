```c
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Optimize memory access patterns to coalesced access in global memory
// Ensure alignment and padding of vectors for better memory access
// Use registers for frequently accessed and computed values within threads
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for potential cache benefits
// Minimize conditionals within the critical performance loop
