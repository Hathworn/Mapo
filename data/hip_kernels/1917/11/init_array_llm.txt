// Cache the factor value to reduce global memory access
// Loop unrolling for improved performance
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for efficient data retrieval
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy and performance
