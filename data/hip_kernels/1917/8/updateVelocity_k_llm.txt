```
// Combine loads of vx and vy for coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for better memory efficiency
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_xor for better data exchange
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid expensive misaligned accesses
// Prefetch data when possible to hide global memory latency
```
