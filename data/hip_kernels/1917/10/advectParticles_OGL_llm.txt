```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and latency.
// Ensure all threads within a block synchronize after loading shared memory using __syncthreads().
// Consider coalesced access and alignment for efficient memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts and contention.
// Evaluate if the grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy and minimize divergence.
