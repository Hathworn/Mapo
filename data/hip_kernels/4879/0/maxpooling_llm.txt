```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// At the start of the kernel, load input values into shared memory.
// Ensure all threads collaborate effectively when using shared memory.
// Optimize memory access patterns to enhance coalescing.
// Verify memory bank conflicts are minimized when using shared memory.
// Prefetch inputs to maximize parallelism and minimize idle time.
