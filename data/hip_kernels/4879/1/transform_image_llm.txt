```
// Utilize shared memory to cache raw_input for further reduction in global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning input and raw_input properly
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to improve performance
// Evaluate the possibility of using texture memory for raw_input for read-only operations
// Optimize the loop order to improve cache performance and reduce cache misses
