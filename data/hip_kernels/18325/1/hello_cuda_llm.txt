```cpp
// Coalesce global memory access to improve memory throughput
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to cache line boundaries to avoid uncoalesced accesses
// Ensure that the data structures used in kernel code are optimized for memory access patterns
```
