```
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced global memory access
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Implement loop unrolling to minimize loop control overhead
// Use register memory to hold intermediate computation results
// Minimize use of atomic operations by restructuring data dependencies
