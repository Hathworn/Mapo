```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for input to improve memory throughput.
// Use caching for frequently accessed kernel data in shared memory to reduce latency.
// Evaluate using constant memory for kernel data if it is read-only and fits in constant cache.
// Inline small functions or loop unrolling manually for potentially better performance.
// Adjust stride and block sizes to ensure optimal resource utilization and minimize warp divergence.
