// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize data access.
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution.
// Unroll loops to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Align data structures on memory boundaries to reduce unaligned memory access.
