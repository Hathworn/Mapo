```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by using a stride that optimizes memory access patterns
// Check for bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for the computation if len is known and small
// Optimize thread block size to match compute capability for better resource utilization
