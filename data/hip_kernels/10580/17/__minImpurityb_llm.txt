```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for 'keys' and 'counts' arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Investigate unrolling loops or using warp-level parallelism to enhance computational efficiency.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is necessary; otherwise, remove it to avoid unnecessary synchronization.
// Consider aligning data structures to natural boundaries to improve memory access speed.
