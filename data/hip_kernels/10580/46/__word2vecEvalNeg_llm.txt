```
// Optimize memory access pattern by using shared memory
// Coalesce global memory access by loading contiguous memory into shared memory
// Ensure shared memory usage is within available limits
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls if possible
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost convolution loop
