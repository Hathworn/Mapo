```
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved bandwidth
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure data is aligned to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Consider vectorized loads and stores for aligned data
// Minimize divergent branches in GPU kernels
