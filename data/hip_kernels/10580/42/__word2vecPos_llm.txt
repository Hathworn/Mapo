```c
// Consider using shared memory to store 'W', 'A', and 'B' to reduce global memory access.
// Load necessary data into registers to minimize multiple global memory reads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when accessing global memory arrays 'A' and 'B'.
// Use __syncthreads() if data dependencies exist between threads sharing data in shared memory.
