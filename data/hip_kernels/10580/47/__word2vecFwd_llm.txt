```
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory where possible
// Ensure coalesced access when loading data into shared memory
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and hide latency
// Avoid bank conflicts by careful shared memory layout design
// Consider using float4 for coalesced access if data alignment allows
