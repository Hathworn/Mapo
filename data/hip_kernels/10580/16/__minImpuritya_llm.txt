// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for reading from counts and writing to outv.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring outg calculations use shared memory where possible.
// Avoid bank conflicts while accessing fieldlens by considering padding or alignment.
// Investigate the reuse of data in registers to minimize global memory accesses.
