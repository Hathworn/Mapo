```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory coalescing by adjusting the memory access pattern.
// Apply loop unrolling if the loop iteration count is fixed and small.
// Use registers wisely to minimize excessive global memory reads and writes.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to optimize memory access.
