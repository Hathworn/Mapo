```c
// Consider reducing global memory accesses by using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure proper memory access patterns to optimize memory coalescing.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by loading input data into shared memory before processing.
// Reduce register usage by optimizing variable scope and reusing registers for intermediate calculations.
// Align memory accesses to improve cache line utilization.
