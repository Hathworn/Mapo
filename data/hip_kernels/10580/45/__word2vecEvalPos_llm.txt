```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for arrays A and B for better performance
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access of A in inner loop
// Explore loop unrolling for the loop iterating over columns to enhance throughput
// Check if memory alignment could improve performance by aligning arrays A and B
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data if applicable
