// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data stored in shared memory if possible
// Consider utilizing __ldg() to load read-only data more efficiently
// Balance workload among threads to avoid divergence
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
