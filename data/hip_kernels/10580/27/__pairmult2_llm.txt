```cpp
// Consider coalescing the global memory access for A to improve memory throughput.
// Investigate whether shared memory could be used to cache portions of A or Bdata for reuse.
// Minimize divergent branching caused by multiple conditional statements in loops.
// Ensure that Bjc array accesses are coalesced and that it benefits from memory prefetching.
// If possible, align the data in A and Bdata to facilitate aligned memory access.
// Optimize the loop iteration order for better memory access patterns.
