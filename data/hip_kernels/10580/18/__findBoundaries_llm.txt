// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Ensure enough threads to prevent thread divergence and enhance memory coalescing
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory for optimal performance
// Prefetch data using shared memory to overlap computation with memory access
// Align shared memory access patterns for efficient utilization
// Minimize register usage within computation loops
