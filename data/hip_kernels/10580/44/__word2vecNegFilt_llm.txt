```
// Consider coalesced memory access for A and B to improve memory efficiency
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results if beneficial for repeated access
// Ensure WA and WB are loaded from global memory efficiently, possibly into shared memory
// Minimize bank conflicts and uncoalesced accesses in memory transactions
// Analyze the use of registers to avoid excessive register pressure
// Evaluate unrolling the computation loop for potential performance gains
