```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if col_sum is accessed repeatedly
// Increase thread block size to better utilize the GPU's compute resources
// Experiment with different grid and block sizes for optimal performance
