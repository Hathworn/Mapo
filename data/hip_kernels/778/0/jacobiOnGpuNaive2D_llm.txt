```
// Cache data in shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling to leverage data reuse and reduce redundant calculations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting index calculations.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further reduce memory divergence.
// Perform boundary checks outside the loop to minimize conditional branches.
// Align memory access patterns to exploit memory read/write throughput.
