```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for noduri array.
// Ensure data is coalesced when loading noduri into shared memory.
// Avoid race conditions by using atomic operations like atomicMin.
// Consider loop unrolling for small NUMAR_NODURI to increase performance.
// Replace dynamic index calculations with constants where possible in loop iterations.
// Optimize access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Reduce the number of checks in the CautareMuchie function for better performance.
