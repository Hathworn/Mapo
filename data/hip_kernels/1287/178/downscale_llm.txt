```
// Precompute offsets to reduce redundant calculations and improve memory access patterns
// Use cached indices to leverage coalesced memory access
// Minimize branching to maintain warp efficiency
// Aim for maximum memory coalescing for improved throughput
// Prioritize register reuse to reduce latency
