```
// Precompute and cache reused variables to reduce calculations inside the kernel
// Use modff to split floating point values into integer and fractional parts, avoiding additional calculations
// Consolidated bounds checking to minimize branching and enhance performance
// Use #pragma unroll to unroll the loop and improve memory access patterns
// Optimize memory access by ensuring dst and normalization_factor are accessed within bounds
// Use _atomicAdd to avoid race conditions when writing to shared memory
