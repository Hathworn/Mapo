```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Preload values used multiple times into registers to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Use shared memory to cache repeated reads for threads within a block where possible
// Evaluate if using textures could provide better cache behavior for read-only data
