// Ensure N_ds is loaded in coalesced manner
// Use __ldg() to load In[] if it is accessed frequently
// Consider half-warp synchronization or padding to solve bank conflicts in shared memory
// Load the entire mask into shared memory if shared memory size allows
// Avoid divergence in if conditions by restructuring logic
