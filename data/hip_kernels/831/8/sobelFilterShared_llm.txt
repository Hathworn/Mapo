// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Ensure boundary checks are performed to prevent invalid memory accesses.
// Load data into shared memory in parallel by surrounding threads to minimize latency.
// Synchronize threads with __syncthreads() after loading data to ensure all threads have updated shared memory before computation.
