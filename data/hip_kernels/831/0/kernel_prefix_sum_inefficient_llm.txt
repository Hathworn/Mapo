```
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access latency
// Optimize memory access patterns to utilize coalesced memory operations
// Ensure threads are accessing contiguous memory locations to reduce bank conflicts
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
