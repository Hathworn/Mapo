```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for Mat1 and Mat2 by ensuring coalesced access.
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed the limits to avoid bank conflicts.
// Experiment with different TILE_WIDTH values for better shared memory utilization.
// Use warp-level intrinsic functions for further performance improvements.
// Check if loop unrolling can be optimized further based on your target GPU architecture.
// Avoid unnecessary syncthreads() calls by confirming data dependency.
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data, like Mat1 and Mat2, for improved cache performance.
