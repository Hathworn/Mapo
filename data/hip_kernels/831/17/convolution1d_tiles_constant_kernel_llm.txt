```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to optimize memory throughput.
// Reduce unnecessary accesses to global memory by making better use of shared memory.
// Adjust TILE_SIZE to perfectly fit into shared memory and avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure syncthreads() is used correctly to prevent race conditions in shared memory.
// Optimize index calculations to reduce arithmetic overhead in the kernel.
// Verify alignment of memory accesses to maximize bandwidth efficiency.
