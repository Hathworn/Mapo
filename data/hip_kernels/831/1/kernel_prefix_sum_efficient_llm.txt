```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access in global memory.
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning operations on warp boundaries.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient parallel prefix sum.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits to avoid spilling to global memory.
