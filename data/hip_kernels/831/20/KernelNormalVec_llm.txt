// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Implement efficient boundary checking to prevent accessing out-of-bound memory
// Load data conditionally to avoid unnecessary memory transactions
// Synchronize threads to ensure proper data handling within shared memory
// Use a reduction pattern within a loop to optimize operations within a block
// Write block result directly to global memory to minimize latency
