```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to the global memory for better performance
// Ensure that each thread accesses data in a memory-efficient manner
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to the hardware's memory transaction size
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can further optimize performance
