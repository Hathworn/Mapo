// Consider coalesced memory accesses for Mat1 and Mat2 for improved performance.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Explore loop unrolling to increase computation efficiency.
// Ensure optimal block and grid sizes to fully utilize GPU resources.
// Assess the possibility of using mixed precision calculations for better throughput.
