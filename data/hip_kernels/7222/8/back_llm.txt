```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns.
// Minimize global memory access by utilizing registers for temporary variables.
// Take advantage of memory coalescing for the variable `deltas_o_d`.
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() is necessary and does not impede performance.
// Prefetch data into shared memory outside of the critical loop if possible.
// Unroll loops where beneficial to reduce loop overhead.
// Check alignment of memory accesses to improve coalescing.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns.
