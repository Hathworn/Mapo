```c
// Reuse data in shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses for weights_in_d and weights_out_d
// Align data structures to ensure proper memory alignment
// Utilize vectorized data loads and stores if possible
// Implement loop unrolling for operations within the kernel
