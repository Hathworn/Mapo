```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Synchronize shared memory access to ensure data coherence among threads
// Consider optimizing memory accesses by using coalesced patterns
// Ensure error_d access is minimized after being copied to shared memory
// Minimize atomic operations if applicable to reduce contention
