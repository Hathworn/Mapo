```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions enable full GPU occupancy.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce memory access latency.
// Minimize thread divergence by processing contiguous data.
// Consider memory prefetching to hide memory access latency.
