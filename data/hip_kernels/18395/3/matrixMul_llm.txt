// Consider coalesced memory access for global memory transactions
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure all threads within a block synchronize before using shared data
// Optimize thread block configuration for your specific GPU architecture
// Consider using loop unrolling for the multiplication loop for further optimization
