// Consider coalesced access to global memory for input loading
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Prefetch input data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latencies
// Align shared memory accesses to reduce bank conflicts
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to optimize the mean calculation loop
