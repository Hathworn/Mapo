```
// Coalesce memory access by accessing consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize branching by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same operations.
// Utilize local variables to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimal for the target architecture.
// Consider using shared memory to store pixel data locally within a block if applicable.
