// Consider optimizing memory access by ensuring coalesced global memory access patterns
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider using constant memory for frequently accessed data
// Ensure alignment of shared memory allocations to improve performance
// Reduce the number of synchronizations within the kernel where possible
