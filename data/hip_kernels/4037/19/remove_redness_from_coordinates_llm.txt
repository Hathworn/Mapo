// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_r, d_b, and d_g.
// Ensure d_coordinates loading is coalesced for better memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to temporarily store values for efficient reuse.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to minimize iteration overhead.
// Evaluate the usage of vectorized memory operations where applicable.
