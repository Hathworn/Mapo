```cpp
// Utilize shared memory effectively by minimizing redundant data movement
// Consider using shuffle operations instead of shared memory for warp-level reductions
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for reading from d_in
// Optimize thread block size and grid configuration for better performance
```
