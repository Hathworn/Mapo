```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic by storing frequently accessed data locally in each block.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Reduce the frequency of atomic operations as they can serialize execution and lead to contention.
