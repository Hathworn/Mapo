```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for loading data from global to shared memory.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the reduction loop to enhance performance.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage by arranging threads to minimize synchronization.
// Use memory access patterns that prevent bank conflicts in shared memory.
