```
// Consider using shared memory to store block-specific data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the computation of thread_id to minimize arithmetic operations per thread.
// Minimize the use of printf in device code as it may introduce significant overhead.
// If printf calls are necessary, consider limiting them to a specific condition, such as thread_id == 0.
// Use __syncthreads() where necessary to avoid race conditions when accessing shared memory.
