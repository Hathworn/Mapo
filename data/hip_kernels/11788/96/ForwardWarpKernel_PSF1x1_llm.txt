```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the u and v arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed values like flow_row_offset and image_row_offset.
// Avoid unnecessary recalculations by storing cx and cy computations in registers.
// Ensure memory accesses for atomicAdd are coalesced for improved performance.
