```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Fuse multiple kernel launches into a single kernel to minimize kernel overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Avoid branching inside the loops for better warp execution efficiency.
// Explore the possibility of reducing atomic operations by using hierarchical parallel reduction.
