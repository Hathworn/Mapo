// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Consider using vectorized memory access to improve throughput
// Ensure optimal block size and grid size for maximizing SM occupancy
// Avoid unnecessary use of __syncthreads() to reduce latency
