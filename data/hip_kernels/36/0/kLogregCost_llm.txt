// Use __ldg for global memory read on constant data for better cache usage
// Use blockDim for thread index calculation to leverage built-in variable
// Employ __logf for improved performance with logarithmic calculations
// Utilize conditional operator to replace if-else statements for conditional checks
// Consider using thrust::device for reduction to improve parallelism and efficiency
