```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Employ loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism
// Vector operations might enhance throughput by processing multiple data in a single instruction
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Evaluate the use of prefetching data to reduce memory access delays
