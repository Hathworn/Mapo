```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if data reuse exists among threads.
// Align memory accesses to the size of a warp to prevent memory transaction overhead.
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing variable scopes and using them efficiently.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to minimize loop control overhead if beneficial.
