```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to 128 or 256 bytes to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use shared memory if possible to minimize global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations to write more data per instruction.
// Double check for memory coalescing opportunities within the loop.
