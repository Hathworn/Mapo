// Ensure that data access patterns are coalesced to improve memory read/write efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Try to eliminate any divergent branches within the kernel.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can provide performance gains in this context.
// Verify that BLOCKSIZE is chosen to fit well within the hardware constraints for optimal thread utilization.
