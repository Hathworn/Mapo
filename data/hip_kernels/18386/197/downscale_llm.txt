```
// Reuse shared memory for loaded gradOutput_data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure threads read and write coalesced memory for increased performance
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory
// Minimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider unrolling loops if scale_factor is small and known at compile-time
