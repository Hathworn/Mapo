```cpp
// Use coalesced memory accesses when reading from and writing to global memory
// Consider using shared memory to achieve coalescing and reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure the grid and block sizes are optimized for the GPU architecture in use
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if shared memory is used
// Use appropriate memory access patterns to minimize memory latency
