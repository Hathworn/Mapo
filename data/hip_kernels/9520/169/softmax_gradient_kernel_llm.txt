```
// Use warp reduction to minimize bank conflicts and improve memory access efficiency
// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory access
// Optimize the use of __shfl_down_sync to ensure warp-level reduction is used effectively
// Ensure that reduction within a block combines results without unnecessary synchronization
// Reduce global memory reads by leveraging cached shared memory where possible
