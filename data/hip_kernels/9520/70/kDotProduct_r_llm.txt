```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Implement loop unrolling for the main while loop when computing shmem values.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to synchronize threads only when necessary.
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts.
