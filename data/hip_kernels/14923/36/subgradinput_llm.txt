```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads and writes.
// Explore using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Review thread and block configuration for optimal occupancy and alignment.
// Align memory accesses to warp boundaries to decrease memory transaction sizes.
// Investigate the impact of loop unrolling on register and memory usage.
