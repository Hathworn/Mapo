```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement loop unrolling in the local sum computation to enhance instruction throughput.
// Ensure that the access pattern of gradOutput_k[i * stride] and output_k[i * stride] is optimized for memory coalescing.
