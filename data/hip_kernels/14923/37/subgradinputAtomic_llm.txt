```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Reduce the number of atomicAdd operations, which can be a bottleneck, by reordering computations.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results before updating global memory to minimize atomic operations.
// Explore warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead within a warp.
// Optimize grid and block size configuration to ensure full utilization of the GPU architecture.
