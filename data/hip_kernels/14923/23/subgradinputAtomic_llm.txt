// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Suggest optimizing tiling or looping strategies to reduce shared memory bank conflicts
// Explore using shared memory to cache weight data for faster access
// Investigate reducing usage of atomic operations for better parallel performance
// Optimize thread mapping to minimize warp divergence
