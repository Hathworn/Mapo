```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for gradOutput and gradInput to enhance memory bandwidth usage.
// Explore shared memory for caching frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Potentially unroll loops further to hide latency and improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Align memory accesses to increase memory throughput and reduce transaction costs.
// Use the restrict qualifier if applicable to aid the compiler in optimizing memory access patterns.
