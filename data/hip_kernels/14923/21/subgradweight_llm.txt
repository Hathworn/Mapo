```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses when reading from input and gradOutput arrays.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses in the inner loops.
// Try using loop unrolling to enhance performance in the computation loops.
// Optimize shared memory usage and reduce bank conflicts within sums array.
// Consider organizing data access pattern to leverage L2 cache more effectively.
