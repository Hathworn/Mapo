```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Review if pointers are correctly aligned to prevent uncoalesced access
// Optimize thread block dimensions to align with memory access patterns
// Inspect if loop unrolling can enhance performance for inner loops
