```
// Consider using registers to store frequently accessed values like 'z' to reduce memory access overhead.
// Minimize bank conflicts by optimizing shared memory access patterns in the reduction process.
// Evaluate the use of warp shuffles for more efficient reduction without requiring __syncthreads().
