// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for matrices a and b.  
// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access consecutive memory locations.  
// Prefer post-increment operations to reduce data dependencies.  
// Minimize arithmetic operations inside the loop by precomputing values outside.  
// Consider loop unrolling for the dot product calculation to reduce overhead.
