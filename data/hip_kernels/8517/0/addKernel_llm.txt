```c
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory access to ensure memory transactions are minimized
// Ensure kernel launch uses optimal block and grid sizes for the target device
// Investigate the use of read-only data cache for constant memory
// Consider using loop unrolling if the loop is large and predictable
// Align memory access patterns to prevent memory bank conflicts
