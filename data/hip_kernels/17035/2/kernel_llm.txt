```
// Ensure appropriate block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Perform boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds accesses
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory
// Optimize shared memory usage by calculating indices properly
// Reduce global memory writes to only necessary updated values
