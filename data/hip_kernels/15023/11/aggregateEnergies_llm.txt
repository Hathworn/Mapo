// Use coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory for improved performance
// Ensure the shared memory size is carefully calculated to fit all data for each block to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider reducing the number of __syncthreads() if possible by restructuring code logic
// Limit the use of shared memory to avoid overuse, which can decrease occupancy
