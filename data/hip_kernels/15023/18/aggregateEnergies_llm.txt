```
// Use shared memory to optimize access to frequently used data
// Load data from global memory to shared memory in batches to improve coalesced access
// Use syncthreads to synchronize threads and ensure all data is loaded into shared memory
// Reduce multiple values in shared memory to minimize accesses to slower global memory
// Write final results from shared memory to global memory in a coalesced manner
// Ensuring that only valid indices are accessed to prevent invalid memory accesses
