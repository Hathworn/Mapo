// Use shared memory to reduce redundant memory reads for the normalization constant
// Ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions with shared memory access
// Consider using vectorized memory access if applicable for better memory throughput
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to maximize warp utilization
