```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_startArray and d_startSumArray.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to increase memory throughput.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts for better performance.
// Adjust the block size to maximize the hardware capabilities.
// Utilize __syncthreads() only if necessary, as it can incur performance penalties.
// Optimize register usage to avoid spilling into local memory.
