// Use shared memory to cache d_startArray for coalesced reads.
// Consider loop unrolling for the if-statement to reduce branching.
// Align d_startSumArray accesses to improve memory access patterns.
// Check for bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Consider minimizing register usage for better occupancy.
