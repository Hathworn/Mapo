// Consider using shared memory for d_boundary to reduce global memory access
// Use vectorized memory access if possible to improve bandwidth usage
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns across threads in a warp
// Minimize conditional statements within the kernel to reduce divergence
// Assess grid and block size configuration for maximizing occupancy and throughput
