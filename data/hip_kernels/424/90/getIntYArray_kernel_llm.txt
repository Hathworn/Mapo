```
// Consider using shared memory for better memory access patterns
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by choosing appropriate block size
// Analyze memory access patterns for possible bank conflicts
// Explore use of warp-level primitives for efficiency
