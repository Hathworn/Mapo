```
// Load uniform value to shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure uniform value is read once per block to optimize memory access.
// Use shared memory to minimize latency from repeated global reads.
// Sync threads to ensure shared memory is loaded before use by all threads.
// Check boundary conditions to avoid illegal memory access.
