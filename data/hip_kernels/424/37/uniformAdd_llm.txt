```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed uniform data within a block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use __syncthreads() to minimize race conditions between threads in a block.
// Reduce global memory access by loading frequently accessed data into shared memory.
// Evaluate potential use of asynchronous data prefetching to further reduce latency.
