```
// Load uniform value into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Use shared memory to store data that is accessed multiple times by threads within a block.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Consider using loop unrolling if it leads to better performance in other parts of the kernel.
