```cpp
// Consider using vectorized memory operations to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory accesses do not collide
// Explore loop unrolling for repeated memory access patterns to reduce overhead
// Prefetch data where possible to hide latency and overlap computation and memory operations
// Align data structures and consider padding to prevent memory access inefficiencies
```
