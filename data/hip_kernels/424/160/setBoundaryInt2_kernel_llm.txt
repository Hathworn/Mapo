```
// Use shared memory to cache d_boundary if accessed multiple times
// Coalesce global memory access for d_boundary and d_boundaryRange
// Ensure blocks have enough threads to fully occupy the multiprocessor
// Avoid warp divergence by minimizing conditional branches
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy
