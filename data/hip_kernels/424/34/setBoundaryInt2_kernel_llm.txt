```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Use shared memory if data is reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel by ensuring that 'if' conditions are uniformly met by threads within a warp.
// Consider using texture memory if there are spatial locality and data reuse, which can provide caching benefits.
