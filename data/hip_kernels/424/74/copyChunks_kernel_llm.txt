```
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Ensure proper memory alignment to maximize throughput of memory transactions
// Reduce the number of iterations in the loop over size variable by vectorizing the copy operation
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching where supported to hide memory latency
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring that all threads in a warp follow the same path
// Use const qualifiers for constant data to enable compiler optimizations
