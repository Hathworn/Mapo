```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Ensure aligned memory access to optimize load and store operations
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp proceed in similar ways
// Use shared memory for intermediate computation to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for the data copy loop to reduce loop overhead
// Check for bank conflicts when using shared memory
