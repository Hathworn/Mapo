// Consider using shared memory to store boundary values temporarily for frequently accessed data
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling techniques to optimize repetitive calculations
// Minimize divergence in control flow, such as checks within if-statements
