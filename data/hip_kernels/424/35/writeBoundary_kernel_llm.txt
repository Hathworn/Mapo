```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for d_startArray and d_startSumArray
// Ensure that d_bounary is written in a coalesced manner
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring consistent execution paths
// Evaluate potential benefits of preloading data into shared memory
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy based on the hardware
