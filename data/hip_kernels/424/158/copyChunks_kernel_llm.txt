```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Perform coalesced memory accesses when reading from d_Rin
// Consider using asynchronous copy to overlap computation and memory operations
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for efficient memcpy
// Explore use of vectorized data types for memory operations
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring the if conditions
