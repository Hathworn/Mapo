```
// Use shared memory to minimize uniform value retrieval overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by addressing consecutive threads to adjacent data.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory load.
// Remove unnecessary operations like multiplication to reduce computational load.
// Ensure boundary checks to avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory.
