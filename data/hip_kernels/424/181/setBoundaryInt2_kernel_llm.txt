```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses to ensure better memory throughput
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to improve occupancy and ensure optimal resource utilization
// Pre-fetch data if possible to hide memory latencies
