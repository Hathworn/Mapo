// Consider coalescing memory accesses to d_boundary for better global memory efficiency
// Ensure d_boundaryRange writes are coalesced to improve memory access patterns
// Evaluate if shared memory can be used to minimize global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism
