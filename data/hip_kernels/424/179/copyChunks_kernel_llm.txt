```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_Rin and d_sum to leverage faster memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need to access the same data within the block
// Minimize conditional checks within device code to reduce thread divergence
// Align memory accesses to optimize data transfer sizes between global and shared memory
// Reduce pointer arithmetic by pre-calculating shared positions outside the loop
// Investigate the use of vectorized loads/stores to enhance memory throughput
