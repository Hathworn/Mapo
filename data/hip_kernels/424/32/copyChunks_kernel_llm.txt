```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory reads and writes with warp boundaries.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by organizing data access patterns.
// Use shared memory efficiently by ensuring the size of sharedSource is appropriately dimensioned.
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() calls to improve performance.
// Consider using loop unrolling for loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Check for warp divergence in conditionals and refactor if possible.
// Align data structures in memory to reduce padding and improve cache utilization.
