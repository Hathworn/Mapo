```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_boundary and d_boundaryRange to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate values if d_boundaryRange is reused across threads to reduce global memory traffic.
// Evaluate if thread-block size and grid configuration provide optimal occupancy and performance.
// Investigate if loop unrolling within the kernel can reduce instruction overhead.
// Tune the kernel launch parameters to ensure maximum utilization of the GPU resources.
