// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for d_input and d_output
// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate values for increased data locality
// Explore vectorized memory operations for int2 data type to enhance throughput
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
