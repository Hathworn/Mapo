```
// Consider coalescing memory access by aligning d_input and d_output in a manner that optimizes global memory reads
// Use shared memory for intermediate values if there are opportunities to use the same data across threads
// Explore using float4 or int4 data types if applicable to reduce the number of memory transactions
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned based on hardware specifications for optimal performance
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied to this section of code for performance gains
