```
// Optimize: Ensure coalesced memory access when reading d_Rin for better performance.
// Optimize: Consider aligning d_source and d_dest pointers for improved memory access efficiency.
// Optimize: Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory reads within the loop.
// Optimize: Evaluate if loop unrolling factor is optimal via profiling for the targeted hardware.
