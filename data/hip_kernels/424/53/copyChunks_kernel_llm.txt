```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_Rin and d_sum to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure memory alignment for char *source and char *dest to leverage memory coalescing.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency.
// Evaluate bank conflicts in shared memory (if added) and mitigate using padding if necessary.
// Optimize unrolled loop for better memory access patterns based on hardware-specific analysis.
