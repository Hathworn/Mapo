// Load 'uni' from global memory into shared memory to avoid repeated global memory accesses by threads.
// Ensure address calculations are vectorized to minimize arithmetic operations for address computation.
// Use __syncthreads() after loading 'uni' to guarantee all threads see the updated value before proceeding.
// Perform addition in parallel to exploit thread-level parallelism and maximize throughput.
