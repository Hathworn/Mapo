```
// Use coalesced memory access for d_input to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns if needed
// Ensure that startPos aligns with warp boundaries for better memory coalescing
// Minimize branching by ensuring pos is always within bounds before accessing d_input
