```
// Use shared memory to cache data for efficient access patterns.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access to warp boundaries.
// Initialize shared memory with boundary values to avoid out-of-bounds access.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques to minimize control overhead.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding data appropriately.
// Optimize conditional checks for data boundaries by using clamp functions.
// Utilize vectorized data type for reducing redundant load operations.
// Prioritize register usage for frequently accessed variables.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to ensure consistent data visibility.
