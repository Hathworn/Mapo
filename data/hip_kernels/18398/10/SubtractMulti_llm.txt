```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory allocations on 128-byte boundaries
// Consider using float4 vectors to load/store multiple data points at once
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and improve throughput
// Use shared memory to cache data if reused multiple times by threads in the block
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize the balance between occupancy and performance
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointer parameters to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
