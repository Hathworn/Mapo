```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to g_Data to reduce memory transactions.
// Use warp-wide operations instead of atomicAdd for histogram summation to reduce contention.
// Prefetch data into shared memory before histogram updates to optimize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use more efficient thread blocking strategy to match the warp size.
// Use fewer synchronizations (__syncthreads()) by restructuring loops or using warp shuffles.
// Further optimize histogram reduction using warp shuffle instructions.
