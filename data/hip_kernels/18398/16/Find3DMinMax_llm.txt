```
// Use __ldg to read from global memory when possible for improved caching
// Reduce shared memory usage by loading minimal required data
// Consider using float2 or float4 for coalesced memory accesses
// Align shared memory arrays to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize the for loop by limiting iterations to active threads
// Consider loop unrolling for the loop with a fixed small iteration count
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for min/max calculations
// Avoid unnecessary shared memory synchronization (__syncthreads())
