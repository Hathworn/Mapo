// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting shared memory access patterns.
// Ensure kernel execution is within valid grid and block limits.
// Optimize loop conditions and break early when possible to save computation.
// Verify if additional memory access patterns can be optimized by using texture memory.
