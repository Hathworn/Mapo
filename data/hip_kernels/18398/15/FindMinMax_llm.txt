```
// Use shared memory judiciously to minimize global memory accesses.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for reading d_Data to reduce access latency.
// Implement loop unrolling for the inner loop to potentially reduce instruction overhead.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by handling conditional statements carefully.
// Optimize the reduction using warp-level primitives if possible for better performance.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses by ensuring data alignment.
// Consider prefetching data when applicable to hide global memory latency.
