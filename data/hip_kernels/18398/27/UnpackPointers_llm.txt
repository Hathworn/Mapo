```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by structuring data access patterns for threads within a warp
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning data properly
// Reduce divergent branching by evaluating conditions outside loops when possible
// Use shared memory to buffer rows if appropriate to minimize global memory transactions
// Optimize loop unrolling manually if compiler optimizations aren't sufficient
```
