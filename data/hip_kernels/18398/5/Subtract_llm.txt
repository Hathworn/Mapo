```
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if needed.
// Ensure alignment of memory addresses for improved access speed.
// Consider using half-warp accesses to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
