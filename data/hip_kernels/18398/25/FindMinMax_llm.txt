```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads from global memory.
// Consider utilizing vectorized memory access to increase load efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Minimize usage of shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
// Prefer loop unrolling for the reduction loop to improve performance.
// Ensure conditional statements are minimized within loops for better divergence handling.
// Evaluate using warp shuffle operations for reduction of warp-level synchronization.
