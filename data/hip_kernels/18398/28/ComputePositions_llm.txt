```
// Consider caching data from g_Data2, g_Data3, and g_Data1 in shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data to take advantage of the texture cache.
// Explore using float2 or float4 vectors for coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure that memory access patterns are coalesced to optimize for the GPU's memory architecture.
// Align data in memory with CUDA's alignment requirements when possible to improve load/store efficiency.
// Consider unrolling loops manually to increase instruction throughput if applicable.
// Use the restrict keyword if applicable to inform the compiler about non-aliasing memory accesses.
// Minimize the use of control flow divergence within warps for better performance.
