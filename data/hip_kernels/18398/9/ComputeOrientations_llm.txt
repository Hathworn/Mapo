```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance.
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately to synchronize shared memory usage among threads.
// Optimize the loop to minimize the number of operations inside the critical path.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction operations to enhance performance.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Consider unrolling loops to further optimize performance.
