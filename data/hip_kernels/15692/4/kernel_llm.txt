```c
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring that global memory accesses are contiguous.
// Use float operations carefully as they may cause performance degradation on some architectures.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size if necessary to achieve higher performance.
// Preload constant values into registers if they are used frequently.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimal for the specific hardware architecture.
