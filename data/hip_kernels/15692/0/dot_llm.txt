```
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce iteration overhead and increase throughput
// Perform memory coalescing to ensure that global memory accesses are coalesced
// Consider using fewer conditional statements to reduce divergent branches
// Maximize shared memory usage to minimize global memory access latency
// Optimize the memory access pattern by utilizing shared memory effectively
// Ensure that the reduction loop is efficiently unrolled to leverage parallel computing power
