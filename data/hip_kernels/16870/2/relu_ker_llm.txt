```
// Consider aligning memory accesses for better performance
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Ensure 'src' and 'dst' arrays are aligned with memory requirements
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Analyze occupancy to achieve better utilization of GPU resources
