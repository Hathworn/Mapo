```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory throughput
// Use shared memory for data reused within the block to reduce global memory access
// Minimize idle threads by optimizing block size for better resource utilization
// Use __restrict__ pointers if applicable to help the compiler with load/store optimization
