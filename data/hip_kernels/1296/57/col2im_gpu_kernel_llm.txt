```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data_col for better memory access efficiency.
// Optimize the loading of data_col to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Minimize the stride and padding calculations inside the loop to reduce computational overhead.
// Use loop unrolling if possible to enhance performance by minimizing loop control operations.
// Investigate the possibility of using asynchronous memory copy to overlap data transfer and computation.
