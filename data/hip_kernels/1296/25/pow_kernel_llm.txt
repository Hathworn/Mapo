```
// Use shared memory to cache input data if access patterns align to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for X and Y for better memory throughput
// Check for occupancy to ensure full utilization of the GPU SMs
// Unroll the loop if the number of iterations is small enough to fit within the register usage limits
// Align memory for X and Y arrays to improve alignment and reduce bank conflicts
