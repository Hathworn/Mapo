```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to improve memory access efficiency
// Double-check shared memory usage; ensure it fits within the hardware limits
// Re-evaluate loop unrolling factors based on target architecture for best results
// Ensure BLOCK is defined appropriately to match the GPU's warp size capabilities
// Assess alignment of memory accesses to optimize coalesced memory reads/writes
