// Optimize memory access by loading variance[i] into a register outside the loop  
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for delta[index]
// Use shared memory to accumulate sum when possible to reduce global memory accesses  
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for better performance  
// Reduce the use of square root function by computing variance[i] + .00001f once and storing it in a register
