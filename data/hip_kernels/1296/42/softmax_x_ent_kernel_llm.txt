// Ensure that data is aligned for optimal coalesced memory access patterns
// Minimize divergent conditional branches by employing predication techniques
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory accesses
// Where possible, employ loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy and performance
