// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access for data_im
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for data_im and data_col pointers
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for data_im_ptr and data_col_ptr
// Evaluate the potential of loop unrolling for i and j to enhance performance
// Optimize memory access by checking alignment and using aligned memory operations
// Assess the usage of warp-level parallelism to improve efficiency
