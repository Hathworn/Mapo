```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate values to reduce global memory access.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize atomic operation performance.
// Minimize use of atomic operations for improved performance.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Use appropriate block size and grid configuration for optimal occupancy.
