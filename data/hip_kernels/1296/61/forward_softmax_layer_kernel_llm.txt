```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for input loading
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() where possible to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction operations to improve efficiency
// Evaluate the amount of shared memory used to prevent excess allocation and ensure occupancy
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing redundant shared memory arrays if possible
// Ensure the block size maximizes the utilization of the GPU resources
