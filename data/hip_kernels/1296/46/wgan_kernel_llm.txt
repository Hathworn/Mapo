// Consider using shared memory for error and delta to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Investigate coalesced memory access patterns to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Ensure use of appropriate grid and block dimensions to maximize hardware utilization.
