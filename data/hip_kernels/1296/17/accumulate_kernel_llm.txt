```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by adjusting data layout
// Optimize loop by unrolling if the value of 'n' is known at compile time
// Use shared memory for partial sums if multiple threads within a block can collaborate
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers
```
