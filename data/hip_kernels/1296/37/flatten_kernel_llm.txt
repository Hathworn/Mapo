```c
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant recalculations of spatial and layer indices.
// Precompute indices used for data access to enhance data locality and reduce computation time.
// Leverage conditional statements efficiently to control data access patterns and flow.
// Ensure blockDim.x is properly set to avoid overusing shared memory.
