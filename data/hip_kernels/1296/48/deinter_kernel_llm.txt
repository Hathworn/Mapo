```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve throughput
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring memory accesses are aligned
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Ensure proper memory alignment for float operations to boost performance
// Balance the workload by optimizing block and grid dimensions
