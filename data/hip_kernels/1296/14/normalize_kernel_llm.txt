// Use shared memory to store mean and variance for faster access
// Ensure coalesced access pattern for x array to improve memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for complex operations to reduce instruction overhead
// Use memory fences if needed to maintain consistent data access in multi-block scenarios
