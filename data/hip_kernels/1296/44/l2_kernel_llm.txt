```
// Consider using shared memory if appropriate to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate whether using warp shuffle can reduce unnecessary memory transactions.
// Remember to launch enough blocks to keep GPU fully utilized, depending on the value of n.
// Check if loop unrolling would be beneficial in this context.
