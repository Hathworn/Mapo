```
// Consider using shared memory to cache 'dc' and 's' values for faster access and reduced global memory traffic.
// Optimize boundary checks to minimize divergent branches and improve warp coherency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for 'a', 'b', 's', 'da', 'db', and 'ds' arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Assess using vectorized loads/stores to further reduce memory transaction overhead.
