```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for 'sum' calculation.
// Prefetch data to registers to improve memory coalescing.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations.
// Ensure memory alignment for better performance when accessing 'x' and 'dx' arrays.
// Investigate the possibility of using half precision for storage or computation to reduce memory bandwidth usage.
// Consider loop unrolling strategies for the final normalization loop to improve execution time.
