```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory if data is reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory access
// Ensure INCX is aligned with warp size for coalescing benefits
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters if applicable to improve compiler optimizations
```
