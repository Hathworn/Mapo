```
// Use shared memory for partial results to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure that shared memory is initialized by all threads before proceeding
// Optimize loop parallelization by assigning each thread a distinct start offset
// Employ reduction techniques to minimize synchronization overhead
// Reduce the number of threads communicating to global memory by computing results in shared memory
