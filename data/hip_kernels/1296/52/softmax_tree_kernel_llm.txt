```
// Consider optimizing the use of __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Avoid atomic operations; consider reductions within a warp for better performance.
// Ensure shared memory size is determined accurately for varying group sizes.
// Evaluate memory coalescing to improve access efficiency to global memory.
// Consider padding shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts.
