```
// Consider unrolling the inner loop over 'i' to increase ILP and efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for the 'delta' array to maximize throughput.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement warp-level parallel reduction to optimize reduction operations.
// Minimize synchronization overhead within the warp for better performance.
// Confirm bank conflict-free accesses in shared memory for efficient usage.
// Keep occupancy high by ensuring efficient use of threads and blocks.
