```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for pred and truth arrays
// Evaluate shared memory utilization if applicable for repeated data access
// Consider using vectorized data types for improved throughput
// Explore occupancy metrics to ensure optimal thread block size
// Profile memory latency to identify potential bottlenecks
// Experiment with loop unrolling for potential performance gains
