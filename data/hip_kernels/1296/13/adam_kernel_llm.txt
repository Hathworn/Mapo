```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling for the powf calculations if the value of 't' is limited and known at compile-time.
// Evaluate the benefit of using vectorized operations if applicable, to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce latency.
// Analyze if there's a possibility to fuse other operations within this kernel to reduce kernel launch overhead.
