```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage if data reuse occurs
// Ensure coalesced memory access by keeping data contiguous
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning data appropriately
// Make sure to use the __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments if aliasing is not a concern
// Explore using vectorized memory access if INCX is constant and allows
// Evaluate the use of warp shuffles to reduce divergence
