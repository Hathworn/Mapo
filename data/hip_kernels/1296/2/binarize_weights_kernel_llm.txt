```
// Consider using a separate kernel or function to compute the mean to avoid atomic operations
// Reduce the dependence on atomicAdd to minimize serialization and improve efficiency
// Use loop unrolling to enhance performance in memory access within the shared memory operations
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing the size and avoiding bank conflicts
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global reads and writes to maximize throughput
// Consider using a faster math approximation or intrinsic for fabsf if precision allows
