```
// Consider using shared memory to store partial sums to improve memory access patterns
// Explore loop unrolling within the inner loop to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing delta and x with contiguous threads
// Apply padding or strided memory access to improve coalescing if necessary
