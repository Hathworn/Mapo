```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure proper alignment of memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transaction count
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for maximum occupancy
// Utilize asynchronous memory prefetching if applicable to hide latency
