```
// Optimize memory access by using coalesced memory accesses for image and rand arrays.
// Consider using shared memory for rand data within a block to minimize global memory access.
// Align data memory types and access patterns to ensure optimal memory access efficiency.
// Suggest pre-calculating reusable values to reduce redundant computations within the kernel.
