```cpp
// Ensure data loading and storing are coalesced for better memory performance
// Encourage the use of shared memory for frequent data access
// Minimize the usage of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use local variables to hold frequently accessed values to reduce register pressure
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for small, fixed-size loops to reduce overhead
