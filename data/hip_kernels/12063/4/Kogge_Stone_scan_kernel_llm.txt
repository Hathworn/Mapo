```
// Consider reducing memory accesses by using registers for temporary values
// Utilize shared memory more efficiently to minimize global memory reads
// Ensure that boundary conditions are handled correctly to prevent memory access violations
// Reduce synchronization overhead by minimizing __syncthreads() calls
// Optimize thread indexing to enhance coalesced memory access
