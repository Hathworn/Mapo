// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Process two elements per thread to reduce overall memory transactions.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for improved bandwidth utilization.
// Implement boundary checks when loading into shared memory to avoid out-of-bounds access.
