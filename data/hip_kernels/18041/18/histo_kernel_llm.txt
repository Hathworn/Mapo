```
// Load histogram data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after initializing shared memory
// Calculate unique starting index for each thread based on block and grid dimensions
// Use stride loop to efficiently process larger data sets
// Use atomic operations in shared memory to reduce contention and bank conflicts
// Synchronize threads before merging results back to global memory
// Reduce global atomic operations by accumulating results in shared memory first
