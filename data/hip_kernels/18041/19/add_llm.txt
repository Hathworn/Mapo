```c
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring data alignment
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access time
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetch or loading
// Optimize loop unrolling factor based on empirical performance testing
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the specific GPU architecture
```
