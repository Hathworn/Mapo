// Unroll loop to increase instruction throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure full reduction completion.
// Employ a binary tree reduction to minimize computational complexity.
// Ensure single write operation per block to global memory for efficiency.
