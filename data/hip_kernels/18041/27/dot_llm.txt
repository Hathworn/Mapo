```
// Consider increasing the block size to better utilize shared memory.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of loop control.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by padding shared memory.
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing shared memory usage.
// Ensure that the grid size (gridDim.x) is large enough to cover all data.
// Balance the workload across blocks to prevent thread divergence.
// Align global memory accesses to optimize memory throughput.
