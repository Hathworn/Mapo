```
// Ensure memory coalescing for global memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider using __ldg for global memory reads if data is read-only
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing shared memory allocation
// Unroll the loop for parallel reduction to reduce synchronization overhead
