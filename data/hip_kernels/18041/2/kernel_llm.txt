```
// Use registers to store temporary variables and reduce memory access
// Replace modulo operations with conditional indexing for efficiency
// Pre-fetch next indices and handle out-of-bound access with conditional logic
// Minimize global memory access by caching data in registers
// Compute averages using pre-loaded register values instead of repeated access
// Write final result back to global memory efficiently
```
