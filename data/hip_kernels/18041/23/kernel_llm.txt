```
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate computations to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize computation in the for-loop by hoisting invariant calculations outside.
// Utilize vectorized operations if possible to enhance memory coalescing.
// Align memory access patterns to facilitate coalesced memory transactions.
// Optimize use of fast math functions wherever possible to increase throughput.
// Ensure data is accessed in contiguous blocks to maximize the cache efficiency.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses by aligning data appropriately.
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data to leverage cache efficiency.
