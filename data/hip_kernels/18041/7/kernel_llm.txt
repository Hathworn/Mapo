// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring contiguous threads follow similar execution paths.
// Use memory coalescing to improve global memory bandwidth by grouping accesses to contiguous memory.
// Optimize register usage to prevent excessive spilling into local memory.
