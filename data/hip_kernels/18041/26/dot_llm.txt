```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for arrays a and b to improve memory throughput.
// Use read-only data cache where possible to reduce memory instruction latency.
// Ensure the number of active warps is maximized to hide global memory latency effectively.
// Evaluate different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for given hardware.
