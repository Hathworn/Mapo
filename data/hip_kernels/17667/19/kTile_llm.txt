```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Consider aligning data to 128 bytes for optimized memory transactions
// Preload data into shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Check if using texture memory could improve access patterns
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could enhance performance in the loop
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions for the specific hardware to maximize occupancy
