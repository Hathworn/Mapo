```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement loop unrolling for memory access within loop
// Utilize a register for intermediate sums to exploit faster register access
// Optimize reduction by accessing shared memory using sequential addressing
// Unroll the last warp for the reduction step to improve parallelism
// Use volatile keyword on shared memory for the final warp reduction to prevent compiler optimizations
// Prefer occupancy balance between shared memory usage and number of active threads
