```cpp
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring continuous threads access continuous memory locations.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed scalar constants such as c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, zero, one, two, temp4, and oneBySqrt2pi.
// Minimize the use of local memory by avoiding redundant calculations.
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize the lambda function for phi to minimize recalculations and reuse calculations wherever possible.
