```
// Use shared memory for faster access
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for dB and dC
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure maximum parallelism
// Alternative memory access patterns can reduce latency
// Align data structures to promote memory alignment
