```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for improved performance.
// Align array indices with memory accesses to minimize bank conflicts.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns in global memory reads.
// Use shared memory effectively to reuse loaded data and reduce data loading overhead.
// Optimize data placement in shared memory to exploit spatial locality.
