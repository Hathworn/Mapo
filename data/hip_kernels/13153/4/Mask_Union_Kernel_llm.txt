// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.  
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to optimize bandwidth utilization.  
// Minimize thread divergence by simplifying conditional logic.  
// Use asynchronous copy operations to overlap data transfers with computation.
