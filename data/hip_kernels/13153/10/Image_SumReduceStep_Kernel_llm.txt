```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Initialize shared memory with global memory reads to optimize memory access
// Prefer contiguous memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access
// Use a single shared memory array for reduction to reduce shared memory usage
// Reduce synchronization overhead by synchronizing threads only when necessary
// Leverage warp-level reduction to minimize divergent branching
// Write results to global memory in a single, coalesced write
