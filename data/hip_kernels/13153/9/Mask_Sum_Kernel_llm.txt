```
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring stride sizes do not overlap in shared memory
// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory addresses
// Minimize synchronization overhead by reducing unnecessary syncthreads()
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access
// Consider using warp-level primitives to avoid full block synchronization
// Reduce divergence by ensuring all threads execute similar instructions
