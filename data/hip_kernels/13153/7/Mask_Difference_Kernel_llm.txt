```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Coalesce memory access patterns for A and B to improve memory throughput
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning data structures in memory
// Consider using loop unrolling if the operation is repeated
// Evaluate benefits of prefetching data to improve latency
