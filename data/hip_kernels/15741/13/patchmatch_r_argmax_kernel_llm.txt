// Precalculate indices and reduce redundant calculations
// Use shared memory to cache data from global memory
// Unroll loops to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve global memory access efficiency
// Minimize condition checks inside the loop to reduce branching
