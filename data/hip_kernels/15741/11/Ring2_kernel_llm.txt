// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like `corrAB`.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses when threads read/write the data.
// Reduce divergence by organizing condition checks to minimize branching.
// Use memory prefetching to improve data loading efficiency.
// Analyze if loop unrolling could benefit the nested loops for processing the area around `ring`.
