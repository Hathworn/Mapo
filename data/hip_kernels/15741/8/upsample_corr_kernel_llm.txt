```
// Precompute w_ratio_inv and h_ratio_inv outside the loop to reduce redundancy
// Use shared memory to store intermediate calculations if re-used by multiple threads
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Align memory access to ensure optimal bandwidth utilization
// Minimize branch divergence by organizing conditional statements
// Leverage read-only cache for input data that does not change
// Consider vectorizing memory loads and stores for improved throughput
