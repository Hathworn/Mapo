```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Implement memory coalescing for contiguous memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction throughput.
// Optimize access patterns to minimize bank conflicts.
// Consider using vectorized data types for better memory throughput if applicable.
