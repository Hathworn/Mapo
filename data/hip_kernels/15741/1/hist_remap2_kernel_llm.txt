```cpp
// Avoid calculating division inside the loop by caching values
// Use bitwise operations to optimize arithmetic calculations
// Reduce redundant memory accesses by storing frequently used global variables in registers
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Access global memory in a coalesced pattern to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize the use of conditional statements within the kernel for better performance
