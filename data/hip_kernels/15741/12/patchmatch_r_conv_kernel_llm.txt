```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider texture memory for read-only data to reduce latency
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses
// Use more aggressive loop unrolling for nested loops
// Consider prefetching data for overlapping computation and memory transfer
// Utilize warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations
