```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within blocks to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations to maximize bandwidth.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can improve performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Use constant memory for parameters if they remain unchanged during execution to decrease global memory traffic.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
