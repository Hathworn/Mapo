```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Load data into shared memory to benefit from faster access.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data.
// Perform sorting within shared memory to maintain efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() again before writing back to global memory.
// Commit sorted data from shared memory back to global memory.
