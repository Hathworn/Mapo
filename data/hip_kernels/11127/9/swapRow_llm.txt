```
// Consider using shared memory to cache matrices rows for faster access and reduced global memory transactions.
// Investigate warp-level synchronization to ensure thread-safe row swaps.
// Explore cooperative groups for more efficient thread collaboration during swap operations.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access to mat and b during the swap.
// Evaluate using atomic operations or reduction for managing 'greatest_row' updates in parallel.
