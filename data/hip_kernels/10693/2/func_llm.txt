```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better throughput
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid performance penalties
// Reduce divergent branching within the kernel
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
// Minimize the use of barrier synchronizations to improve performance
// Load data into registers when reused multiple times to save memory bandwidth
