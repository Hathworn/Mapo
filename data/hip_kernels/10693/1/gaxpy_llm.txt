```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory is utilized efficiently to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using asynchronous memory copies to optimize memory transfer.
// Align data structures for better memory access patterns.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Perform computations in registers whenever possible to reduce latency.
