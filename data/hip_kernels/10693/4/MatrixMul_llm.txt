// Consider using shared memory to store tiles of Md and Nd to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring data access patterns in shared memory are optimized.
// Prefetch data for Md and Nd into shared memory before executing the loop.
// Make use of coalesced memory access patterns for writing to Pd to enhance memory throughput.
// Evaluate the optimal TILE_WIDTH to balance shared memory usage and thread execution efficiency.
