```cpp
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure all threads have completed their operations with __syncthreads()
// Consider larger block sizes to improve occupancy and resource utilization
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently used for data reuse between threads
// Reduce synchronization overhead by minimizing __syncthreads() usage
// Align global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
```
