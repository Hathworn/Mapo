```
// Consider using loop unrolling for the tile multiplication loops to improve performance.
// Ensure TILE_WIDTH is defined appropriately to maximize shared memory utilization.
// Explore using memory coalescing techniques to improve global memory access patterns.
// Optimize for register usage by minimizing the number of variables declared inside the kernel.
// Check if the use of shared memory is optimal for the tile size used; consider smaller or larger tiles.
// Verify if synchronization points are necessary or can be minimized to reduce latency.
