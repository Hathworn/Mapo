```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if there are common repetitive accesses among threads
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for better performance
// Prefetch segments of memory into shared memory to minimize global memory latency
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for your GPU architecture
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap computation with memory transfer
