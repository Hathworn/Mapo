```
// Load kernel values into shared memory for faster access
// Use shared memory for random values within each block to reduce global memory access
// Consider using texture memory for random access patterns with improved cache behavior
// Optimize the loop by using register tiling techniques for kernel computations
// Eliminate redundant calculations for memory indices by pre-computing and reusing values
// Minimize conditional branching within the loop for smoother execution
