```
// Use shared memory for kernel coefficients to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Use shared memory for input data within each block to improve memory access performance
// Coalesce global memory accesses for random array to maximize memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches within the for loop to improve warp execution efficiency
