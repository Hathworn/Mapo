```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditions
// Prefer __restrict__ pointers to improve compiler optimizations
// Optimize memory prefetching to reduce latency
```
