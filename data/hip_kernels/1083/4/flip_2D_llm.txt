```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to achieve better performance
// Explore the use of loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Verify if the memory layout can be optimized for better access patterns
