```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the coords array to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory for the rot_matrix to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to prevent bank conflicts.
// Perform loop unrolling if applicable to enhance instruction throughput.
