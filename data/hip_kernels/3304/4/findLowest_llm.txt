// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for array_val.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing array_val for stride-appropriate memory layouts.
// Benchmark __syncthreads() usage to assess its necessity in current context.
// Evaluate atomic operations if multiple writes to cudaResult can be optimized.
