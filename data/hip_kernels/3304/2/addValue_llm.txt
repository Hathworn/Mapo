```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for array_val for better memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory usage effectively reduces redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize synchronization by minimizing the number of __syncthreads() calls.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to decrease synchronization overhead.
// Ensure the shared memory size is adequate but not excessive to avoid resource contention.
