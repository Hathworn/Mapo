// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.  
// Consider padding arrays to ensure each thread accesses contiguous memory blocks.  
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory where possible for intermediate computations.  
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to optimize occupancy and balance between computation and memory latency.  
// Evaluate using different memory access patterns to find the most efficient method for the specific hardware.
