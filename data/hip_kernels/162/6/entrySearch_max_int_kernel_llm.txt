// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses  
// Use loop unrolling in the reduction step to further optimize performance  
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing  
// Ensure data is properly synchronized before writing back to global memory  
// Consider using atomic operations if necessary for conflict-free writes to global memory
