```
// Consider reducing shared memory usage if possible to improve performance.
// Ensure memory coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize the use of shared memory to only necessary data to increase occupancy.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Ensure that shared memory usage is correctly aligned and within limits to avoid bank conflicts.
