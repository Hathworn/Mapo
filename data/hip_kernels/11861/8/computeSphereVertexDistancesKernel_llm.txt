```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for input array V.
// Ensure coalesced access by making threads read contiguous elements.
// Reduce global memory accesses by caching commonly used values.
// Use fast math functions like __fmaf_rn for efficient calculation.
// Avoid branch divergence by refactoring conditional statements.
