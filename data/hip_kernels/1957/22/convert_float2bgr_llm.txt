// Optimize memory access by ensuring float* annd and unsigned char* bgr are coalesced.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring (x < w && y < h) condition is uniformly met.
// Reduce redundant calculations by hoisting (maxval - minval) outside the loop if constant.
// Ensure the use of __restrict__ keyword if applicable for pointer arguments to enhance compiler optimizations.
