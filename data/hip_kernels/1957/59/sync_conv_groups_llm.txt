```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Align data structures to improve memory throughput
// Minimize global memory access by utilizing shared memory
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data
// Avoid memory bank conflicts by properly indexing shared memory
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in global kernels
// Analyze instruction-level parallelism to maximize GPU utilization
