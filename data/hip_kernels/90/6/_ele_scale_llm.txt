// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive elements among threads.
// Consider using float4 for vectorized operations to improve throughput.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations if race conditions are possible.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to achieve optimal performance.
