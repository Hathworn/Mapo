```
// Optimize the usage of shared memory by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory.
// Preload shared memory to reduce global memory access during convolution.
// Use padding to align loads and avoid uncoalesced global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for the convolution computation for better performance.
// Use fewer __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead, only when necessary.
