```
// Consider employing read and write coalescing for memory access optimization
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing shared memory reuse
// Evaluate the effectiveness of loop unrolling to ensure it enhances performance
// Use 2D shared memory tiles to better utilize the shared memory space
// Ensure shared memory access patterns are optimized to prevent bank conflicts
// Consider employing double buffering to hide memory latency further
// Profile the kernel to identify if unrolling and tiling improve memory throughput significantly
