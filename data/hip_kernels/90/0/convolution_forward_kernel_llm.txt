```
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory accesses and improve data reuse.
// Make sure to handle boundary conditions precisely when preloading image data.
// Ensure correct synchronization after loading shared memory to avoid race conditions.
// Consider using loop unrolling techniques within the convolution calculation for potential performance gains.
// Align data access patterns in shared memory to maximize memory throughput.
// Evaluate the size of the shared memory to ensure that it does not exceed hardware limitations.
