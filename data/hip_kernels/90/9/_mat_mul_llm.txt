```
// Optimize memory coalescing when accessing ma and mb by ensuring continuous memory access
// Consider increasing the block size to enhance parallelism and better utilize the GPU
// Ensure shared memory usage is within hardware limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce synchronization overhead
