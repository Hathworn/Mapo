```cpp
// Use shared memory to load feature map data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider memory coalescing for fm and probs accesses to maximize throughput.
// Avoid bounds checks inside loops for better performance.
// Use a single division to calculate the reciprocal of sum, to reduce computational overhead.
// Avoid recalculating rnd_index multiple times; calculate it once per thread.
// Vectorize innermost loops if possible to take advantage of SIMD units.
