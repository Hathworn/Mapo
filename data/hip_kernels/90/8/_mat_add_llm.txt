// Ensure coalesced memory access by processing contiguous elements
// Minimize thread divergence by using a fixed stride within the loop
// Consider using shared memory if accessing ma and mb repeatedly
// Optimize use of registers by minimizing intermediate computations
// Utilize occupancy calculator to optimize block size and threads per block
