```
// Consider increasing the tile size for better memory throughput if resources allow.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when loading global memory into shared memory.
// Minimize conditional checks to reduce divergent execution for threads.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to optimize global memory access patterns.
// Optimize synchronization usage to ensure minimal waiting times between threads.
