// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads and writes
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure proper thread synchronization for shared memory access if implemented
// Investigate the use of texture memory for potentially faster read operations
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to aid compiler optimizations
// Calculate kernelOffset outside of the loop to avoid redundant multiplications
