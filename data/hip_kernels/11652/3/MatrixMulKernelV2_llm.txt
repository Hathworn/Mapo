```
// Move fixed index calculations outside the loop to optimize memory access
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access, ensuring data locality
// Unroll inner loop to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction throughput
// Adjust TILE_WIDTH according to GPU's warp size to maximize efficiency
