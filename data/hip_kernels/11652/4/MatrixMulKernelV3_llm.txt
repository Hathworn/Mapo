```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access per iteration
// Ensure proper loading by checking memory bounds before loading into shared memory
// Initialize shared memory with zeros for unused locations to avoid incorrect calculations
// Consider loop unrolling in the innermost loop for potential performance gains
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions in shared memory
// Write computation results to global memory only when within bounds
```
