```c
// Use shared memory to cache A and B arrays for improving memory access efficiency.
// Consider using memory coalescing when accessing A[i] for improved bandwidth.
// Use __syncthreads() after loading data into shared memory to ensure all threads have consistent data.
// Unroll further or apply warp-level primitives to reduce the loop overhead if n is known to be small.
