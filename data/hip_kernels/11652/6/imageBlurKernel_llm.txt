```c
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage by using wider tiles and reducing loops
// Suggest aligning shared memory tiles with warp sizes for better efficiency
// Recommend using warp shuffles instead of shared memory for small data exchanges
// Explore using a loop unrolling technique to reduce loop overhead in computation
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Evaluate if the memory access can be further optimized by using texture memory
