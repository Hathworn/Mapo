```
// Consider using shared memory for tiles of M and N to reduce global memory access
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for N to improve memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding if necessary
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency
// Optimize loop unrolling factor based on empirical testing
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
