```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses along warp boundaries.
// Optimize the use of atomic operations to minimize serialization overhead.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce latency.
