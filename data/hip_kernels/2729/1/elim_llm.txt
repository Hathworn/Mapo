```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve read efficiency
// Ensure all threads in a block are active and avoid warp divergence
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory where possible
// Align shared memory access for optimal performance
// Prefetch necessary data into shared memory to reduce access latency
// Use streaming stores to optimize write-back to global memory
// Double-check shared memory boundaries to prevent bank conflicts
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could provide performance benefits
