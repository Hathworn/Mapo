```
// Optimize block and thread index calculation by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Precompute scale factor squared to reduce redundant calculations
// Precompute x offset and y offset outside the loop to minimize arithmetic operations
// Reuse base_ipidx and increment with offsets to reduce repeated index calculations
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns
