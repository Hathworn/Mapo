```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access pattern to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider leveraging shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Apply loop unrolling directive to enhance loop execution efficiency
// Ensure all accesses to global memory are coalesced to minimize latency
// Utilize warp-level operations to reduce synchronization overhead
```
