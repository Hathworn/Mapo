// Use loop unrolling to enhance memory coalescing for better performance.
// Utilize shared memory to accumulate intermediate sums, reducing global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access.
// Avoid bank conflicts within shared memory during reduction phase.
// Use volatile keyword for shared memory operations to prevent compiler optimizations affecting memory access.
