```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Use __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler with alias analysis
// Consider using float4 or float2 for vectorized memory operations
// Ensure shared memory usage is within the resource limits
// Utilize more warps for faster reduction to improve occupancy
