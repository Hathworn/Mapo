// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Only one thread loads the global value to avoid redundant reads
// Synchronize to ensure all threads access the updated shared value
// Performing division on one thread to minimize computation overhead
// Reduce global memory writes by updating only once from shared memory
