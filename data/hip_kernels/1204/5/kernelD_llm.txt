```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads and writes
// Consider using read-only cache for input data to improve bandwidth usage
// Optimize shared memory allocation to minimize bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronization barriers
// Investigate warp-level primitives for further optimization in atomic operations
