```
// Use shared memory for improved memory access performance
// Load global memory to shared memory to reduce global memory access times
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads()
// Optimize shared memory usage based on blockDim
// Perform computation in shared memory
// Avoid excessive __syncthreads() if possible
// Write data from shared memory back to global memory
```
