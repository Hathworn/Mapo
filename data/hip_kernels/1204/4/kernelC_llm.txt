```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments to improve memory access optimization
