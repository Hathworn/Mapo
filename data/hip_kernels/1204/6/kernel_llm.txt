// Suggest using __restrict__ keyword to improve memory access optimization.
// Suggest increasing block size if occupancy is not maximized.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses within a warp.
// Use shared memory if operations on array elements within a block are dependent.
// Ensure optimal grid size for the device being used.
