// For coalesced memory access, ensure that 'A' is accessed in a linear fashion
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing 'g_shared' by ensuring aligned access
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and memory throughput
