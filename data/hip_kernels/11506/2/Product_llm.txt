```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling within the inner loop for better performance
// Ensure memory access patterns allow for coalesced reads and writes
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Use vectorized memory loads if possible to increase throughput
// Minimize the number of computations and leverage any mathematical identities
