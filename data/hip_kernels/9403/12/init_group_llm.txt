```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory access
// Minimize shared memory usage where possible to reduce overhead
// Use vectorized loads and stores where data alignment allows
// Consider using constant memory for frequently accessed values like col_widths and init_vals
// Evaluate loop unrolling strategies for the innermost loop for potential performance gain
