```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads in block scope
// Ensure proper alignment of memory to achieve coalesced accesses
// Prefetch data into registers for repeated use within the kernel
// Minimize the use of device-wide atomic functions
// Try loop unrolling techniques for predictable iteration patterns
// Balance workload among threads to prevent divergence
