// Consider reducing __syncthreads() usage to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate if using warp-level operations can further reduce memory access latency.
// Potentially use atomic operations if pos_buff update causes race conditions.
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy and balance shared memory usage.
// Assess the benefit of pre-fetching data into shared memory outside of the loop.
