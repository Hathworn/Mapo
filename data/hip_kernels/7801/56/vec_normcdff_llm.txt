// Consider using shared memory for the y array if it is reused multiple times by threads
// Check if result array can be allocated in a faster memory space like shared memory or registers
// Use texture memory for improved cache coherence with read-only data (y array) if applicable
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data access patterns to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize block and grid sizes to fully utilize GPU resources based on the problem size
