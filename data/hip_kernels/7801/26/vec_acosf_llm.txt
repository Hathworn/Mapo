```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Analyze memory usage and benefit from shared memory if appropriate
// Evaluate the use of constant memory for frequently read-only data
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths within warps
// Ensure the kernel is fully utilized by appropriate choice of block and grid size
// Use memory prefetch if needed
