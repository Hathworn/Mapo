// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Evaluate if loop unrolling improves performance for small critical sections
// Investigate usage of atomic operations if data race conditions occur
// Ensure proper alignment for memory accesses to avoid fragmentation
