```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for threads within the same block
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring data is accessed in sequential and aligned manner
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by using registers for temporary variables
// Use `__restrict__` qualifiers for pointers if memory accesses do not overlap
