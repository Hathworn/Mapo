// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring x, y, and result are contiguous in global memory.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if appropriate.
// Optimize memory loads with vectorized data types if possible.
