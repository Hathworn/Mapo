```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block
// Use coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory access speed
// Minimize register use to allow more threads per block
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on hardware specifications
// Try to reduce the number of memory accesses inside the loop
// Avoid using global memory when possible, prefer local memory
// Use constant memory for values that don't change
// Profile memory access patterns to identify bottlenecks
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage
