// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and operations to warp boundaries.
// Explore using vectorized memory operations if the hardware supports them for better memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp execution efficiency.
// If possible, rearrange the data to allow memory accesses in contiguous chunks, enhancing memory bandwidth usage.
