```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory if reused data within a block is needed
// Ensure enough active warps to hide memory latency by tweaking blockDim.x and gridDim.x
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers for potential compiler optimizations
// Optimize loop bounds calculation for better performance if array sizes are known to be divisible by warp size
