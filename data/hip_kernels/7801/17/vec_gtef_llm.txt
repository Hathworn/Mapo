```
// Use coalesced memory access for better memory access efficiency.
// Ensure result, x, and y arrays are aligned in memory to improve performance.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently used variables.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for the hardware.
