```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning 'x' and 'result' to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Implement further loop unrolling if beneficial for larger stride iterations
// Check if the memory access pattern can benefit from texture memory
// Ensure optimal block and grid size to maximize device occupancy
// Evaluate using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers 'result' and 'x'
