```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider using shared memory or registers for intermediate computations to reduce global memory accesses
// Evaluate if increasing block size could provide better efficiency by maximizing occupancy
// Check if using warp-level primitives can optimize computation further
// Investigate if loop unrolling might reduce instruction overhead in the loop
