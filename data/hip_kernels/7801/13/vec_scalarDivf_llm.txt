```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Apply loop unrolling for improved instruction throughput
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning the access pattern with warp size
// Utilize warp divergence reduction techniques
// Minimize register pressure by reusing registers effectively
