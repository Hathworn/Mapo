```
// Consider using shared memory to buffer elements for better memory access patterns.
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for improved performance on GPU architectures.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel for optimal thread execution.
// Evaluate the register and shared memory usage to prevent occupancy limitations.
// Ensure the kernel is launched with an appropriate number of threads and blocks.
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead.
