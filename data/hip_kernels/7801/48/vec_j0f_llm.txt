```
// Use __restrict__ keyword for result and x pointers to indicate no aliasing for better optimization
// Utilize shared memory if possible to load data used multiple times by threads
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure result and x arrays are aligned for better memory access pattern
// Unroll the loop for small values of stride to reduce loop overhead
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data for potential caching benefits
