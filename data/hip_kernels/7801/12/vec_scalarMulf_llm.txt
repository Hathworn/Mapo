```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing with proper data alignment
// Use float4 data type to leverage vectorized operations
// Experiment with different block sizes for occupancy optimization
// Ensure kernel is launched with sufficient grid size to cover all data
