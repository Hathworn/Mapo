```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data
// Utilize shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data
// Opt for a larger block size to increase occupancy
// Aim for memory accesses that are sequential to minimize latency
// Use the __restrict__ keyword for pointers if aliasing is known not to occur
