```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory addresses
// Use shared memory to cache input data if memory access patterns allow for reuse
// Ensure global memory writes are coalesced by aligning 'result' pointer to a multiple of the warp size
// Consider increasing block size to maximize the occupancy and reduce overhead
// Use '__restrict__' qualifier for pointers to enable better optimization by the compiler
// Check for the potential use of loop unrolling if further iterations or calculations are added
