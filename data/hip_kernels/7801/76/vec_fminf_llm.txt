// Consider using shared memory or cache for frequently accessed data to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns to minimize global memory transactions.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and reduce warp divergence.
// Evaluate the use of memory-prefetching techniques to hide latencies and improve kernel performance.
