```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for x and y to maximize memory throughput
// Ensure result array is also accessed in a coalesced manner for optimal performance
// Evaluate using shared memory if data reuse within blocks is possible
// Align data structures on suitable boundaries to avoid misaligned memory access penalties
