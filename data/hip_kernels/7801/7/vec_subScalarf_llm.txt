```cpp
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for x and result arrays
// Minimize divergent execution by ensuring uniform control flow
// Optimize block size and grid size based on hardware characteristics
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding where necessary
```
