```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that data used by consecutive threads are contiguous in memory
// Utilize shared memory for repeated access to the same data to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize divergence by ensuring if condition applies uniformly to blocks of threads
// Ensure proper occupancy by tuning block size and grid size
// Use __fdividef for potentially enhanced performance on division operations
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
