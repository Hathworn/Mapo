```
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for x and result
// Utilize asynchronous memory transfer to hide memory latency
// Apply loop unrolling to decrease instruction overhead
// Consider using vectorized operations for further optimization
```
