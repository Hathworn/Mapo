```
// Ensure alignment of input and output arrays for coalesced memory access
// Prefer using float4 or float2 for loading/storing when possible to reduce memory transactions
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput
// Optimize stride to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory scenarios
// Implement prefetching if memory access latency is a bottleneck
