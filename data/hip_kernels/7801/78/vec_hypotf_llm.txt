// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data if applicable
// Ensure proper alignment for memory accesses if the data type size allows
// Consider using read-only cache or texture memory for input data
// Profile and experiment with different grid and block configurations
