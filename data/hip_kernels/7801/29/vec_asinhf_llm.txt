```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for coalesced access.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to optimize coalescing.
// Optimize the occupancy by adjusting the block size and grid dimensions.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler with aliasing optimization.
// Minimize register usage by simplifying calculations where possible.
// Consider using float2 or float4 to load data in chunks for better memory throughput.
// Use memory padding if necessary to avoid bank conflicts.
