```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing to optimize global memory transactions
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data for faster access
// Adjust block and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy and performance
// Apply loop unrolling for performance improvement if applicable
// Optimize for register usage and minimize thread divergence
