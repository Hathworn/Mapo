// Consider coalesced memory access pattern to improve memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to increase data reuse and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory alignment for the 'result' and 'x' arrays for optimal performance.
// Explore occupancy levels to better utilize GPU resources and hide latency.
