```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays 'result' and 'x'
// Use shared memory if there are any common subexpressions or accesses
// Reduce register usage within the loop if possible
// Ensure that 'n' is aligned to BLOCK_SIZE for full occupancy
// Avoid using exp10f(x[i]) repetitively if the same calculation can be reused
