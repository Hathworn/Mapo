```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning thread accesses to consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and minimize global memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized operations for more efficient data processing
// Adjust block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy and to match the hardware capabilities
// Evaluate if using __restrict__ qualifiers can help the compiler optimize memory access
// Minimize register usage to improve occupancy by optimizing variable storage and usage
