// Use shared memory to reduce access to global memory
// Make sure shared memory is large enough for all threads in a block
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data before proceeding
// Align data access patterns to coalesce memory accesses
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
