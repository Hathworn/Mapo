// Utilize shared memory to decrease global memory access latency
// Minimize global memory transactions by coalescing memory accesses
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits
// Sync threads after loading to shared memory to prevent race conditions
// Consider optimizing block size for better performance and resource usage
