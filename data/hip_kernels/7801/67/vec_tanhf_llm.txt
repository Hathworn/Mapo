```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for better global memory performance
// Optimize shared memory usage by limiting the size to only the required threads
// Ensure occupancy rate is maximized by fine-tuning block and grid sizes
// Evaluate if reducing the number of synchronizations can improve performance
