```
// Use shared memory to enhance memory access speed and reduce global memory transactions
// Ensure shared memory size matches blockDim.x for optimal performance
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Optimize global memory access by coalescing loads
// Ensure data fits within shared memory limits and adjust as necessary
// Check id boundary condition to prevent out-of-bounds access in the result array
