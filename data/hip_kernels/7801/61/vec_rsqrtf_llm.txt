```
// Use coalesced memory access for `x` and `result` by ensuring data is contiguous.
// Minimize the use of global memory and prefer shared memory if applicable.
// Consider preloading `x` values into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Evaluate the occupancy and ensure block size is optimized for the GPU architecture.
// Use the `__restrict__` keyword to indicate non-overlapping data for potential compiler optimizations.
// Check alignment of `result` and `x` for potential vectorization of loads/stores.
// Balance the workload by ensuring an optimal number of threads per block is configured.
