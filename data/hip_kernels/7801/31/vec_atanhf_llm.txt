// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory access
// Ensure proper usage of shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Avoid bank conflicts in the shared memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvements
// Optimize the grid and block size for maximum occupancy
