```
// Use shared memory to cache ghatmap if it is repeatedly accessed
// Use shared memory or registers to cache scale if it is constant across threads
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for pwcc and c arrays
// Consider using a 2D grid if blockIdx.y is utilized, to fully exploit parallelism
// Minimize latency issues by optimizing global memory access for index
