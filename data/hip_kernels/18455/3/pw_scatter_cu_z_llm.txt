// Ensure ghatmap accesses are coalesced to optimize memory transactions.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage if access patterns allow.
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing conditional checks.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to balance computational and memory access efficiency.
// Align data to enable coalesced access, particularly if adjustments are necessary for ghatmap.
