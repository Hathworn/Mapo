// Use shared memory for faster access and reducing global memory load  
// Minimize divergence by using more efficient warp communication patterns  
// Align memory accesses to improve coalesced access efficiency  
// Implement loop unrolling where possible to reduce overhead  
// Consider using atomic operations if reductions are being performed  
// Ensure memory writes are correctly synchronized with __syncthreads()  
// Optimize thread block size to maximize GPU occupancy and resource utilization  
// Evaluate using different memory spaces such as __constant__ for read-only data
