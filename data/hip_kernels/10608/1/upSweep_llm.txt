// Consider using shared memory to cache data within a block for faster access.
// Evaluate the use of coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of loop control and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy and efficient use of resources.
