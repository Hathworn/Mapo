```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if N is large.
// Ensure memory is coalesced for better performance if accessing global memory.
// Explore using atomic operations if this operation is part of a larger kernel.
// Verify if N can be precomputed outside the kernel to save computation inside.
