```
// Pre-calculate start positions and avoid recalculating inside the loop
// Limit the use of conditional checks inside the loop to improve loop efficiency
// Implement coalesced memory access to maximize memory throughput
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider unrolling the loop to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
