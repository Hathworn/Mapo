```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring uniform code paths across threads.
// Use the __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler with optimizations.
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
