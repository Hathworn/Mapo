```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data
// Explore shared memory to cache repeated reads from global memory
// Implement double buffering for hiding memory latency
// Ensure alignment of data to improve memory access efficiency
// Use vectorized data types for memory operations
// Minimize bank conflicts when utilizing shared memory
// Prefetch data to reduce access latency where possible
