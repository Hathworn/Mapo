```
// Use shared memory to cache vertex data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for loading vertices.
// Optimize neighbor vertex access by reusing shared memory when possible.
// Employ fused multiply-add (FMA) operations for efficient arithmetic.
// Minimize divergence by handling edge cases consistently.
