```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Perform computations as close to data loading as possible to reduce latency between load and use.
// Minimize the size of shared memory to reduce shared memory bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling to increase throughput if the loop iteration count is fixed and known.
