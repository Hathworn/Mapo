```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure threads within a block are synchronized before using shared memory
// Each thread should handle multiple elements from the matrix when possible
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for both global and shared memory
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize divergence
// Use padding in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
