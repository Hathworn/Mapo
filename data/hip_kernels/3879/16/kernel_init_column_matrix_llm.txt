```
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by using strided access patterns
// Use shared memory if appropriate to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further optimize memory access and reduce divergence
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if shared memory is introduced
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if SIMD instructions are available
// Profile the kernel to identify any additional memory access bottlenecks
