```
// Avoid redundant writes by using a single thread for computation
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced writes if applicable
// Utilize shared memory if further operations are needed on *c
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable for reducing branch divergence
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency
