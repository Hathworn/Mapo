```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for grad_x, grad_y, and grad_z
// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate results if possible
// Consider using vectorized data types for grad_x, grad_y, grad_z to improve memory throughput
// Pre-compute repeated expressions to reduce the number of operations
