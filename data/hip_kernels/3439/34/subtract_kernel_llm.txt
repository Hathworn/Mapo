```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize the usage of global memory in favor of shared memory when possible.
// Ensure that the data accessed by consecutive threads is contiguous in memory.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access if shared memory is utilized.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency.
