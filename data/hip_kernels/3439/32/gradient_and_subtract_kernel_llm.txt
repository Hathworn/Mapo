```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads access sequential data elements
// Pre-fetch boundary elements to reduce conditional checks and improve branch predictions
// Optimize memory alignment to improve coalescing and reduce bank conflicts
