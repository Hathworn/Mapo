// Align data access to memory coalescing to improve performance
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergence in control flow by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path
// Consider using a constant cache for frequently accessed invariant data
// Optimize block and grid size configuration for maximum occupancy and efficiency
