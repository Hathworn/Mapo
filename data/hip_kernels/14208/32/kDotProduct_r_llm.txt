// Utilize shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access for faster data retrieval.
// Implement loop unrolling within the for loop to improve computation efficiency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for arrays 'a' and 'b' to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Prefer atomic operations or warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Avoid excessive synchronization by optimizing warp-level operations in the reduction phase.
