```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses of contiguous threads for improved performance.
// Avoid divergent branching by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path when possible.
// Leverage vectorized memory operations if supported by the hardware to further improve memory throughput.
