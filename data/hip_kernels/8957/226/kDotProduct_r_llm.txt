// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing global memory accesses for a, b arrays.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts during reduction phase.
// Consider loading data into shared memory in smaller chunks to improve efficiency.
// Use loop unrolling for the final warp-level reduction to maximize performance.
// Evaluate vectorized memory access if data alignment permits to enhance throughput.
// Examine register usage and push to limit to reduce shared memory pressure.
