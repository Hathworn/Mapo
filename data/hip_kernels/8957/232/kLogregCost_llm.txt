```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for input pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time
// Minimize divergent branching in the kernel for better warp execution efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures according to warp size
// Investigate using pinned memory or memory pools for faster host-device memory transfers
// Implement more aggressive loop unrolling and vectorization where applicable
