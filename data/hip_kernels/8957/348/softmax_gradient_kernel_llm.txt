// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data to utilize texture cache and improve memory access speed.
// Use float4 to load multiple elements per thread for better coalesced memory access.
// Consider thread coarsening: make each thread handle more elements to reduce looping overhead.
// Use warp-shuffle instructions for reduction instead of shared memory to decrease shared memory usage and increase speed.
