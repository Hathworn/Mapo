```cpp
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced for dst array
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory load latency
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to aid the compiler in optimizations
// Use loop unrolling if seed is large to improve performance
```
