```
// Use shared memory to load inputs if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory access.
// Align data loads to warp size for coalesced memory access and improved performance.
// Consider using texture memory or constant memory for data that is read-only and often accessed.
// Minimize bank conflicts by appropriately using shared memory and considering its alignment.
