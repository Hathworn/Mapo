```
// Consider using shared memory to cache d_D and d_N for coalesced access.
// Use loop unrolling if the dimensions of d_D and d_N are known and fixed.
// Maximize occupancy by optimizing block size and utilizing more threads per block.
// Align d_W, d_D, and d_N to 128 bytes to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Implement double buffering technique if applicable to hide memory latency.
