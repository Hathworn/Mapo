// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory is populated before use
// Implement warp-level operations to maximize execution efficiency
// Optimize switch statement by aligning memory operations per thread
// Consider using atomic operations if necessary for shared variables
