```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for tmp array
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern in loops for Y, dY, and dX
// Minimize bank conflicts by carefully mapping accesses in shared memory
// Utilize __syncthreads() appropriately to avoid race conditions
// Replace multiple loads/stores with registers wherever possible
