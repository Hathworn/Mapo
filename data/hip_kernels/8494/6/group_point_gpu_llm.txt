```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for points
// Adjust shared memory size as needed for different input sizes
// Load points into shared memory to minimize repetitive global memory reads
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory is properly populated before use
// Consider further optimization by coalescing memory access if possible
```
