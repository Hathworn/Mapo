```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to coalesce global memory loads
// Utilize shared memory for xyz1 and xyz2 data to reduce global memory traffic
// Use registers for frequently accessed data: x2, y2, z2
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads follow similar execution paths
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency
