```
// Optimize: Use shared memory to cache frequent accesses to dist array
// Optimize: Explore warp-level primitives to reduce divergent accesses
// Optimize: Consider using registers to store temporary values if possible
// Optimize: Verify memory alignment for coalesced accesses to dist and out arrays
// Optimize: Evaluate the impact of block and thread configuration on memory access patterns
