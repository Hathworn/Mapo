// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access by caching matrix values
// Coalesce global memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Consider data prefetching to hide memory latency
// Reduce warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp have similar execution paths
