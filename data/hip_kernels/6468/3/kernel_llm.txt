```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branching within warps for more efficient execution.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to prevent unaligned memory access penalties.
// Consider shared memory usage if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access frequency.
