```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Consider using memory coalescing techniques for efficient memory access.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to enhance memory access speed.
// Reduce divergent branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Minimize register usage per thread to allow greater occupancy.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce latency during computation.
// Optimize data access patterns and stride to enhance cache utilization.
