// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency
// Explore using warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize synchronization and improve performance
// Unroll loops where beneficial to improve ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
