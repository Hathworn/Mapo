// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of src used by multiple threads (memory locality)
// Evaluate whether coalesced memory accesses are being achieved
// Analyze if warp divergence can be minimized in the loop structure
// Examine if the loop unrolling could provide performance benefits
// Check if the thread assignments can be optimized for warp efficiency
