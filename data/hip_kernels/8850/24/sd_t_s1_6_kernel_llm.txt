```cpp
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure all data is loaded into shared memory before proceeding
// Synchronization after loading data into shared memory
// Use work distribution across threads to minimize idle threads
// Avoid unnecessary global memory accesses; use shared memory
// Synchronization after kernel execution to ensure all computations are complete
