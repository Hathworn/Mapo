```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory to enhance performance.
// Ensure that shared memory is utilized efficiently to reduce global memory access latency.
// Implement cache-aware operations to reduce memory latency during computation.
// Opt for coalesced memory access in main computation loop to optimize performance.
