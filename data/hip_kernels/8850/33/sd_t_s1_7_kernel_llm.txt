```
// Improve memory coalescing for accessing t2_d in shared memory load.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads to reduce warp divergence.
// Investigate using warp-level primitives for better performance.
// Use loop unrolling to enhance throughput where appropriate.
// Evaluate if atomic operations can be reduced or optimized.
// Ensure contiguous memory access patterns for better cache utilization.
