```
// Use shared memory to store tile of t2_d for faster access
// Preload data into shared memory by each thread to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid using division and modulus operations in loops for index calculation
// Unroll loops where possible to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure all threads have completed writing to shared memory before proceeding
// Reduce compute-to-memory ratio by optimizing index reuse
// Align data access patterns for coalesced memory access
```
