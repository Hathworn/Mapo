```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to avoid shared memory race condition
// Utilize all threads to efficiently load shared memory
// Optimize the loop to minimize register usage
// Minimize global memory access by utilizing shared memory
// Calculate indices before the inner loop to reduce redundant calculations
