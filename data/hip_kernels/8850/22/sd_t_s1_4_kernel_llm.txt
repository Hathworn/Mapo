```
// Load t2 data into shared memory in parallel to reduce global memory access
// Ensure synchronization after loading data to shared memory to avoid data races
// Use shared memory for t2 data to minimize global memory loads in computation
// Optimize thread mapping to maximize memory coalescing for global memory access
// Minimize conditional checks within loops to reduce control overhead
// Synchronize threads after main loop if shared memory is reused
