```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for t2_d.
// Ensure coalesced access when loading data into shared memory.
// Use efficient modular arithmetic for index calculations to save computation.
// Distribute work among multiple blocks to ensure balanced workload.
// Loop stride is gridDim.x * blockDim.x to allow each thread to handle multiple indices.
// Employ conditional statements to prevent out-of-bound memory access.
