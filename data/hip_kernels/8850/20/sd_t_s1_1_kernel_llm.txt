```
// Prefetch global memory into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have written their data to shared memory before it is used
// Utilize effective thread usage by unrolling loops over potential threads
// Direct indexing in computations to avoid additional arithmetic operations
