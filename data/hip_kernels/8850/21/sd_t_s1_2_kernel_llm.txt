```
// Load t2_d into shared memory to improve access speed
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory loads are complete
// Use registers to minimize local computation overhead
// Ensure all memory operations are finished with __syncthreads()
