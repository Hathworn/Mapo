```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Ensure efficient use of shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Consider using warp-level primitives to improve memory access patterns
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Optimize register usage to maximize occupancy and efficiency
// Evaluate block and grid size to achieve optimal performance
