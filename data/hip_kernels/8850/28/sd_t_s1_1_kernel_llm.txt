```
// Minimize data transfer latency by reducing the number of accesses to global memory using shared memory.
// Use grid-stride loops to efficiently handle large datasets.
// Remove redundant computations in loops to optimize performance.
// Ensure shared memory accesses are coalesced for maximum throughput.
