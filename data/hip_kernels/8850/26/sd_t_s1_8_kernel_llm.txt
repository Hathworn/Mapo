```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns in loading t2_d to shared memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for t2_d
// Optimize the thread synchronization by reducing the number of __syncthreads()
// Leverage loop unrolling in the nested loops if possible for computational efficiency
// Ensure optimal grid and block dimensions to fully utilize the GPU's resources
// Investigate the possibility of vectorized operations for faster data processing
