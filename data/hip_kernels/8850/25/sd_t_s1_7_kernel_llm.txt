```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for t2_d loading.
// Explore using loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead in the main computation.
// Ensure t2_shm is accessed in a bank conflict-free manner for optimal shared memory performance.
// Investigate if using double buffering or prefetching strategies could improve data loading for t2_d or v2_d.
// Check if computational intensity can be increased by consolidating nested loops where possible.
// Assess if implementing memory padding could minimize potential stride issues during global memory access.
// Evaluate potential benefits of using warp shuffle operations to reduce shared memory pressure.
// Determine if mixed precision arithmetic could be beneficial while maintaining acceptable numerical accuracy.
