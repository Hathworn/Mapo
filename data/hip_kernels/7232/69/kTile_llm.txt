```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads by using linear indexing
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve access speed
// Consider using loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize warp utilization
