```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread IDs with memory layout
// Consider prefetching data to reduce latency during initialization
// Evaluate potential use of shared memory for state storage to minimize global memory access
// Investigate if reducing block size improves memory throughput by increasing active threads
