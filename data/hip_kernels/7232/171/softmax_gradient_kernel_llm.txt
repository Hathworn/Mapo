// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses by storing intermediate results
// Prefer warp-level operations for reductions to minimize synchronization overhead
// Align memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Utilize thread unrolling in loops for enhanced occupancy and performance
