```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by using contiguous threads access for arrays a and b
// Consider using double buffering for shared memory to hide memory latency
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if possible to aid compiler optimizations
// Adopt loop unrolling in accumulation to increase instruction level parallelism
// Optimize shared memory reduction to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider occupancy-specific optimizations based on DP_BLOCKSIZE
// Use __shfl_xor for warp-level shuffle to reduce instruction count
