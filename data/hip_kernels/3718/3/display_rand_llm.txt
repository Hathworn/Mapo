```
// Ensure optimal memory access by coalescing global memory reads and writes
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Increase occupancy by optimizing block and grid sizes
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data to reduce global memory load time
// Ensure the kernel launch parameters maximize GPU resource utilization
