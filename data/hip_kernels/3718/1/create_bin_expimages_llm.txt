```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Experiment with different block sizes based on hardware specifications
// Minimize divergent branching within the warp
// Pre-fetch necessary data to reduce memory latency
// Consider using half-precision calculations if applicable to save memory bandwidth
