```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads/writes
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate values to reduce global memory accesses
// Evaluate loop unrolling techniques if loop iteration count is known at compile time
// Optimize memory access by aligning data structures to reduce bank conflicts
// Assess benefits of pre-computed values outside of kernel to minimize redundant calculations
