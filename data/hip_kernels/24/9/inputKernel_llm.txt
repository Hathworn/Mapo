// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency, especially if data reused
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations in row-major order
// Optimize loop by unrolling to enhance computational efficiency if applicable
// Investigate reducing the data size by using a narrower type if precision permits
