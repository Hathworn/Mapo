// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access both when loading into and storing from shared memory.
// Use TILE_DIM + 1 to avoid shared memory bank conflicts.
// Apply boundary checks to prevent out-of-bound memory access.
// Leverage grid and block dimensions for efficient data partitioning.
