```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory allocations.
// Use shared memory if the data size fits to reduce global memory access latency.
// Investigate if data prefetching can be applied to hide memory latency.
// Consider using float4 or float2 to optimize memory transactions and increase throughput.
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied to reduce loop overhead.
