```c
// Make sure memory accesses are coalesced
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branches, ensure threads within a warp execute the same path
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory transactions
```
