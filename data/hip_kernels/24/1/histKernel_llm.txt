```c
// Consider optimizing memory access by using coalesced accesses for input data
// Improve shared memory usage by reducing bank conflicts for better performance
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for the initialization step to exploit parallelism
// Use atomic operations judiciously as they can become a bottleneck at scale
// Consider restructuring data in a struct-of-arrays manner to improve memory coalescing
