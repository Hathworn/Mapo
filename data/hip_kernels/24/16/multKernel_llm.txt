```
// Optimize shared memory usage by coalescing memory accesses in the tile loading phase.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access when loading data into shared memory.
// Consider increasing TILE_WIDTH to better use shared memory, depending on hardware constraints.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls if possible for performance improvement.
// Explore using float2 or float4 data types for vectorized memory access where applicable.
