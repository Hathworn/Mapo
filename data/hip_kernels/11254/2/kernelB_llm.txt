```
// Ensure memory coalescing by using consecutive memory locations for each block
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use float4 or other vectorized types to improve memory throughput
// Check for memory alignment to minimize uncoalesced memory accesses
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to aid compiler optimizations
```
