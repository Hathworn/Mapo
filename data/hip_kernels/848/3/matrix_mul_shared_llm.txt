// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure TILE size fits within shared memory limits for optimal performance
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use __syncthreads() effectively to avoid race conditions and ensure correct execution order
// Utilize loop unrolling for improved performance on repeated access patterns
