// Consider coalescing memory accesses for osim and odpt to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed isims and idpts values within a block
// Optimize memory alignment by ensuring all arrays are properly aligned with respect to access patterns
// Employ loop unrolling for blocks with small but frequently accessed data to reduce instruction overhead
