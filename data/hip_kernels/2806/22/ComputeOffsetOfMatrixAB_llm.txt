// Consider using shared memory to cache row_sum and col_sum for faster access
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access to row_sum and col_sum to improve memory throughput
// Prefetch data for row_sum and col_sum if possible to hide latency
