```
// Minimize memory accesses by calculating base index outside the inner loop.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to enable potential compiler optimizations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by proper data layout.
// Prefetch data to shared memory if reuse can benefit performance.
// Use float4 for vectorized loads/stores if applicable to improve bandwidth.
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop count is a constant.
