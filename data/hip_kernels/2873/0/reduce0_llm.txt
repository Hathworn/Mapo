```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data from global to shared memory
// Implement loop unrolling for the reduction to improve performance
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Consider using warp-level primitives for performance enhancement during reduction
// Ensure that memory operations are done in a coalesced manner to improve memory throughput
