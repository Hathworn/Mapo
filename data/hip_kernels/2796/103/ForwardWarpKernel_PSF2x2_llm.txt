// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency during pixel position calculations.
// Consider using vectorized data access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access continuous memory locations for src and dst arrays.
// Avoid branching where possible by using bitwise operations for simplified bounds checks.
