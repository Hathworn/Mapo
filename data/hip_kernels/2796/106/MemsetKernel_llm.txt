// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to store block-specific data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is optimal for memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ keyword to potentially reduce pointer aliasing.
