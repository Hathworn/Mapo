// Use shared memory to store normalization factors for better memory access efficiency.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for the image array to improve memory throughput.
// Reuse loaded values as much as possible to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure the normalization_factor array is accessed in a coalesced fashion.
