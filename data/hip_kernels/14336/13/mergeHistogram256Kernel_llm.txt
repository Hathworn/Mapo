```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve performance
// Utilize warp shuffle functions to reduce reliance on shared memory
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts
// Ensure sufficient occupancy for the given GPU architecture
// Use loop unrolling for the final reduction step if applicable
