```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for d_PartialHistograms to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access during reduction
// Unroll reduction loops further to decrease the number of synchronization points and improve performance
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is minimized to reduce synchronization overhead
