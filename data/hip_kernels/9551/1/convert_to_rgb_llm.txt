```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access when multiple threads access the same data
// Consider using texture memory to cache frequently accessed data such as hsv
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to improve coalesced memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Ensure that the step and channels are properly aligned to memory boundaries for coalesced access
