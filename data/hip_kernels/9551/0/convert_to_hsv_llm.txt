```
// Use shared memory to cache input data for reducing global memory access
// Minimize unnecessary branching by using single-pass conditions
// Consider loop unrolling for max-min computation to improve efficiency
// Optimize global memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access patterns
// Use float4 instead of separate floats for reading and writing to reduce memory operations
