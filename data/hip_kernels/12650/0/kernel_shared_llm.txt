// Optimize memory access patterns for A, B, C, and result arrays  
// Implement coalesced memory access for matrices  
// Use shared memory for B matrix to minimize global memory access  
// Ensure shared memory access is aligned and doesn't cause bank conflicts  
// Minimize redundant calculations in indexing and operations
