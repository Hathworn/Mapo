```
// Consolidate index calculations to improve performance by reducing redundant calculations.
// Ensure that shared memory is utilized to cache data and improve memory access times.
// Reduce global memory accesses by calculating and reusing indices only when necessary.
// Align memory access patterns to ensure coalescing and reduce latency.
// Consider loop unrolling for potential latency hiding and improved computation efficiency if loops are involved.
// Optimize thread block and grid sizes to achieve maximum occupancy and hardware utilization.
