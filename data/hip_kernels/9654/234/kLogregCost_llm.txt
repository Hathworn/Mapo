```
// Optimize: Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring all threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Optimize: Minimize use of local variables in register space to enhance warp efficiency.
// Optimize: Use more shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize: Profile for warp divergence and reduce conditional branches if possible.
// Optimize: Implement loop unrolling for the inner loop to enhance performance.
