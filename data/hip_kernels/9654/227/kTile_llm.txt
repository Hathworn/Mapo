```
// Consider using shared memory for src to increase data reuse and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by having threads read contiguous memory addresses.
// Use loop unrolling inside the for-loop to reduce instruction overhead.
// Employ warp-level primitives for more efficient data distribution within a warp.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for your GPU.
// Minimize the thread divergence inside the loop by aligning memory accesses.
