// Consider using memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns.
// Analyze and align data structures to fit warp memory transactions for better performance.
// Ensure shared memory is utilized optimally and minimize bank conflicts.
// Prefetch data from global to shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Investigate if loop unrolling can lead to significant performance gains.
