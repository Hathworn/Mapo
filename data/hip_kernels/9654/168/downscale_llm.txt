```
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data during computation to reduce global memory access
// Consider employing loop unrolling for the inner loops to improve performance
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and improve load balancing
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for both gradInput_data and gradOutput_data arrays
// Use appropriate compiler flags for further performance optimization (e.g., -O3)
