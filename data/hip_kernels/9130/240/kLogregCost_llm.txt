// Consider coalesced memory access for probs and labels arrays
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory transactions for prob calculations
// Utilize __ldg() for reading constant data to take advantage of read-only cache
// Experiment with different block sizes to improve warp occupancy and performance
