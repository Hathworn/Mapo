```c
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for better memory access efficiency
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring dY, Y, and dX are accessed sequentially
// Utilize warp shuffles for reduction instead of shared memory for lower latency
// Reduce __syncthreads() usage by leveraging warp-level primitives
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by padding shared memory allocations
```
