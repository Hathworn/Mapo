```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for neighboring pixels
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring boundary checks
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data to optimize access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses when possible for in and out arrays
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed-size iterations (e.g., for kernel computations)
```
