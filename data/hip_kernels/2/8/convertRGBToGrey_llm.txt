```
// Minimize branching and conditionals for better performance
// Use aligned memory access to improve coalescing
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory transactions by minimizing memory reads/writes
// Ensure memory access patterns are sequential to optimize cache usage
