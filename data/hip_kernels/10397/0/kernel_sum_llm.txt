```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Minimize bank conflicts for shared memory access
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on the hardware constraints
// Balance the number of threads per block to maximize occupancy
