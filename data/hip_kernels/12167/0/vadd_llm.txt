// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data frequently
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy
// Minimize use of divergent threads within warps for better performance
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for this kernel
