// Suggest preferring coalesced memory access where possible to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory accesses and improve latency.
// Evaluate the grid and block size configuration to ensure full occupancy and efficient use of hardware resources.
// Reassess memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts and unaligned memory accesses.
