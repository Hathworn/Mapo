```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data structure with warp size
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform loop execution paths
// Limit the number of registers used per thread for better occupancy
// Balance the workload among blocks and threads for optimal hardware utilization
