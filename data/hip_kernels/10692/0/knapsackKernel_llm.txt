```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data for better performance
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for coalesced memory transactions
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce overhead and optimize computations
// Consider tuning block and grid sizes to match the problem size for optimal use of hardware resources
// Utilize occupancy calculator for determining optimal block size for full GPU utilization
