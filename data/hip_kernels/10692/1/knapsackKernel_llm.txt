```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning memory accesses
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if possible
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for better performance
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Utilize warp-level primitives to optimize thread communication
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path
