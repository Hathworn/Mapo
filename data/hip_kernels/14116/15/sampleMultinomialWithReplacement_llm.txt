```
// Consider increasing the block size along y-dimension to maximize occupancy.
// Use shared memory for normDistPrefixSum if possible to improve memory access speed.
// Coalesce memory accesses in dest by having threads write sequential elements.
// Ensure each block's random state is well-separated to avoid correlation between block random numbers.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if normDistPrefixSum and dest have no aliasing issues.
// Consider splitting the kernel if the loop structure causes warp divergence.
