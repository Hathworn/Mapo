```cpp
// Use shared memory to store output values to reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalescing global memory access for inputs and kernel.
// Perform loop unrolling to optimize inner loops for kernel computation.
// Utilize bank conflict-free access patterns in shared memory.
// Prefer arithmetic operations over global memory access when possible.
// Implement block synchronization efficiently after shared memory operations.
// Minimize redundant computation by intelligently mapping threads to data.
