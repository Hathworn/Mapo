```
// Use shared memory to cache res_stride to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using coalesced memory access for the index array to improve memory throughput
// Prefetch src data to shared memory to improve data reuse and reduce memory latency
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Optimize conditional statements to avoid unnecessary calculations within loops
