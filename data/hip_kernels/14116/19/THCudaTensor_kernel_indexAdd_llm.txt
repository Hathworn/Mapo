```
// Ensure enough shared memory is allocated for index caching
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to further optimize memory throughput
// Utilize warp-level primitives to reduce latency for index updates
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources
