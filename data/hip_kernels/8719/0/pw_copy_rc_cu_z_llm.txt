```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for optimal performance
// Ensure memory access patterns are sequential and aligned
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Verify if merging multiple kernel invocations is beneficial
// Check whether increasing block size might improve performance
