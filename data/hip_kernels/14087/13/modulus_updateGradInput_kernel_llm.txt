```
// Use shared memory to cache input data if there is reuse among threads.
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for gradInput and input.
// Consider using float2 for input and gradInput to load/store two values at once.
// Avoid divergence in thread execution paths for efficiency.
