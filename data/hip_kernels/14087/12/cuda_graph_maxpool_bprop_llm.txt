```
// Use shared memory to load gradOutput and indices data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Using atomicAdd might cause serialization; consider reducing thread contention by reordering computations.
// Check if coalesced memory access patterns are present for gradOutput and indices to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Consider optimizing the loop to unroll based on the size of nClusters and the number of threads.
