```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data
// Consider coalescing memory access for better memory throughput
// Minimize memory divergence by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Align data structures for more efficient memory transfers
// Opt for using native mathematical functions for enhanced performance
