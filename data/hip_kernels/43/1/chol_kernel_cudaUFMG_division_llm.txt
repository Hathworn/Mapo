```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for frequently used data.
// Prefetch elements from global memory to registers to optimize memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when accessing global memory.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads when necessary to prevent race conditions.
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditional statements.
