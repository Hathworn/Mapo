```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by adjusting thread-stride mapping
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning data accesses with warp size
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed values to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to improve instruction throughput
// Prefetch data elements to registers to reduce memory latency
// Explore using multiple warps to handle reduction operations across threads
