```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed U elements to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in U.
// Align Uk_i data type size with memory transactions to improve memory throughput.
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize occupancy and ensure efficient use of compute resources.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
