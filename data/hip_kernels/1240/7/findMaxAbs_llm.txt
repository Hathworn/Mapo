```
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for d_rowVec, d_colVec, and d_val to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure points array access maintains memory coalescing for improved performance
// Use atomic operations to accumulate values in d_umat2 if parallel threads write to the same location
