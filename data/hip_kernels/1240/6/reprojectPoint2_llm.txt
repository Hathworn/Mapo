// Use coalesced memory access to minimize memory transaction costs
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel loop
// Prefer shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider reducing register pressure by optimizing loop body operations
// Ensure proper memory alignment for improved access efficiency
