```
// Use shared memory to cache d_ub and d_lb to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch points data to shared memory to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning pointCount and pointsPerFile accordingly
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory for storing variables
// Consider using vectorized data types if possible to enhance memory throughput
