```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated memory access for cn, nhMd, and nhSg
// Optimize memory coalescing for accessing xx and pr arrays
// Explore loop unrolling strategies for repetitive calculations within the thread
// Evaluate use of constant memory for frequently accessed but read-only data like cn
// Minimize divergence by ensuring similar execution paths for condition evaluation
