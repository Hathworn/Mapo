```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Increase number of threads per block to allow better utilization of GPU resources
// Use vectorized data types like float4 for loading/storing multiple elements at once
// Prefer using atomic operations where applicable to avoid race conditions
