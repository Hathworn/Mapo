// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for improved memory access efficiency
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures to optimal sizes for GPU architecture
// Prefetch data to minimize memory latency and improve throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for enhanced performance when accessing contiguous memory locations
