```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if same data is accessed by multiple threads
// Evaluate if constant memory can be used for constants to reduce instruction overhead
// Optimize powf computation by replacing it with multiplication if the exponent is a small integer
// Ensure loop unrolling does not lead to excessive register usage
