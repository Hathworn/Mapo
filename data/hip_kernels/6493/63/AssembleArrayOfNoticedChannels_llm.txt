// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access latency
// Loading of lwrNtcdEnrg and hghrNtcdEnrg into shared memory should be restricted to a single thread to avoid redundancy
// Synchronize threads after loading shared variables to ensure all threads have the updated values
// Calculate index based on block and grid dimensions to maximize parallel execution
// Perform boundary checks after index calculation to ensure memory access within valid range
