// Consider using shared memory for variables that are frequently accessed
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Avoid redundant computation by storing intermediate results
// Optimize memory bandwidth by minimizing accesses to global memory
// Ensure computations can effectively use the available parallelism
