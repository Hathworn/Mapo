```c
// Use shared memory to store the delta values calculated for each dimension to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Ensure that shared memory is initialized by looping through each dimension only once per thread block.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory initialization for consistent access.
// Minimize global memory accesses by calculating the index offsets within a single thread block.
```
