```
// Consider using shared memory for crssctns and abndncs to reduce global memory access.
// Explore loop unrolling more extensively for the element traversal to enhance performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns as much as possible for crssctns.
// Assess potential benefits of prefetching data into registers for repeated use in the loop.
