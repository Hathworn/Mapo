```
// Consider coalescing memory access for array 'a' if possible
// Ensure 'd' is aligned for optimal memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning memory accesses in shared memory
// Use shared memory if 'a' and 'd' need to be reused within the block
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize performance
