// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to improve memory access speed.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to avoid unnecessary global memory transactions.
// If applicable, consider using texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of caching benefits.
// Use __restrict__ keyword to indicate non-aliasing pointers, potentially improving compiler optimization.
