```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve performance.
// Ensure that the data is aligned for optimal memory operations.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Investigate if using float2 or other vector types can enhance memory bandwidth utilization.
// Profile the kernel to identify memory bottlenecks and adjust thread block configurations accordingly.
