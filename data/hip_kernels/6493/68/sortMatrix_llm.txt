```
// Consider using shared memory to store portions of 'a' accessed by the block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to ensure maximum occupancy.
// Ensure coalesced access pattern to 'a' and 'sm' for improved memory bandwidth usage.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel by restructuring conditional logic.
