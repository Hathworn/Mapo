```
// Utilize shared memory to cache the x array for faster repeated access by threads.
// Coalesce global memory access for both xx and yy to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider using float4 data type for vectorized memory operations when dim is a multiple of 4.
// Reduce the index calculation by leveraging warp or block granularity for thread mapping.
