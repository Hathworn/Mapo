// Use grid-stride loop for better occupancy and scalability
// Ensure coalesced access by using contiguous threads to access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize loop unrolling for preventing pipeline stalls
