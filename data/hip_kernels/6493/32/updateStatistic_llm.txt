```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for stt1, q, r, and stt0 arrays
// Minimize divergence by reducing conditional operations within the kernel
// Optimize shared memory usage to improve memory access speed (if applicable)
// Consider using __restrict__ to indicate non-overlapping data pointers
// Investigate potential loop unrolling for performance gain (if applicable)
