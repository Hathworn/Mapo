```cpp
// Avoid shared memory as it doesn't provide benefits for this kernel
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Use an optimal block size to maximize GPU utilization
// Consider utilizing __restrict__ keyword to help the compiler with optimizations
// Ensure thread divergence is minimized within the warp
```
