```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Preload hh[Indx] into a register to avoid repeated global memory access
// Preload a[Indx + j * dim] and b[Indx + i * dim] into registers for each thread
// Move constant calculations like sqrtf(2 * PI) outside of the main loop
// Consider memory coalescing for better memory access patterns
