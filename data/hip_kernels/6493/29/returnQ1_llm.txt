```
// Precompute reused expression to reduce redundant calculations
// Consider loading data into shared memory for better cache performance
// Favor the use of float literal suffix for consistent floating-point operations
// Minimize branch divergence by rearranging condition checks
// Use expf and powf functions to ensure efficient computations
