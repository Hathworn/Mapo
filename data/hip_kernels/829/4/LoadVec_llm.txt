```
// Use shared memory to improve data reuse and reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Optimize the use of available registers to enhance performance.
