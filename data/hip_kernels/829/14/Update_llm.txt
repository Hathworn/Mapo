```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve throughput
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts for efficient data transfer
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergence
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for load balancing
// Leverage asynchronous memory copy and kernel execution where possible
```
