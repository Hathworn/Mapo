```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for A, B, and C arrays
// Utilize warp shuffles for reducing inter-thread communication overhead if applicable
// Ensure alignment of A, B, and C to improve memory access efficiency
// Investigate using __ldg() for read-only data if upgrade to newer hardware allows
// Use memory prefetching techniques to hide latency for large data sets
// Consider measuring performance impact of replacing __mul24 with __mul_hi if full 32-bit product is not required
