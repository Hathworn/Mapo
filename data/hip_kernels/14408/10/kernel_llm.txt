```
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Loop unrolling could be applied if n is known and reasonable in size to enhance performance.
// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays A and B to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize usage of local variables to reduce register pressure.
