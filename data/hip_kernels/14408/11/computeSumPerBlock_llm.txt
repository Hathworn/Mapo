```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for global memory reads
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts
// Minimize synchronization by optimizing memory access patterns
// Use atomic operations if there's contention on global memory writes
// Evaluate if using warp-level primitives could improve performance
// Ensure thread divergence is minimized during reduction
```
