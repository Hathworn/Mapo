// Use shared memory to improve memory access times
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing variable usage
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to avoid unnecessary aliasing
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures optimally
// Balance the number of threads and blocks for full GPU utilization
// Utilize loop unrolling to maximize performance by reducing loop overhead
