// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads from global memory
// Consider utilizing shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Explore using warp-level operations for better resource usage
// Check if bank conflicts can be avoided when using shared memory
// Investigate the possibility of using texture memory for improved caching efficiency
