```
// Use coalesced memory access for reading `probs`, `labels`, and `maxProbs` to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider minimizing divergent branches within warps for better performance
// Optimize the warp reduction process by using warp intrinsics like __shfl_down_sync
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using an optimized parallel reduction pattern for calculating `numMax`
// Ensure proper use of `__syncthreads()` to avoid race conditions
