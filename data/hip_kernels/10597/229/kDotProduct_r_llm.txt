```
// Utilize coalesced memory access for input arrays a and b
// Ensure __shared__ memory size is appropriately set per block
// Consider pre-loading data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize loop unrolling to take advantage of reduced branch divergence
// Utilize warp synchronous programming to optimize performance in the warp-level reduction
