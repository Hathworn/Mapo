```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for reduction to optimize memory accesses.
// Employ binary-tree summation for efficient reduction and minimized synchronization overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses when loading Y and dY into registers.
// Align memory access pattern to improve global memory load efficiency.
