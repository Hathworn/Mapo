```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate the use of shared memory if there is potential for reducing global memory accesses
// Explore potential benefits of using vectorized data types (e.g., uint2 or uint4) for wider memory transactions
// Use __syncthreads() if any synchronization is required after memory writes (not needed here)
// Benchmark with different BLOCKSIZE values to find optimal performance settings
