```
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Use shared memory if the pattern writing involves reused data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider warp-level primitives for better synchronous operations among threads.
// Minimize the use of divergent branches within the kernel function.
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency.
