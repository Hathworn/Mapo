```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access costs
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Align data access to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Preload necessary data into shared memory to reduce latency
// Synchronize threads appropriately when accessing shared memory
// Consider double buffering for further performance improvement
// Ensure that global memory writes are coalesced
