```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within a block
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning threads with memory layout
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls if possible and ensure necessary synchronizations are correct
// Optimize access patterns to use sequential rather than strided global memory accesses
```
