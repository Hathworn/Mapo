```
// Coalesce memory access for improved global memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure hiprandState is initialized with unique seeds for each thread to avoid correlation
// Use shared memory to temporarily store results within the block before writing to global memory
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring control flow if possible
// Consider using atomic operations for global memory updates to avoid race conditions if necessary
