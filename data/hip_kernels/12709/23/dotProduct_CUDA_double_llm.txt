```
// Ensure that blockDim.x is a multiple of 32 to maximize memory coalescing
// Use constant memory or texture memory if the data size is small and read-only
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threadIdx.x < stride check has uniform execution across threads
// Consider using warp shuffle functions to reduce synchronization overhead
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to optimize memory access
