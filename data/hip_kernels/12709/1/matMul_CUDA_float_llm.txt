```
// Use shared memory for tiles of input matrices to improve memory access patterns.
// Use coalesced memory accesses in global memory while reading input matrices.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in the accumulation process.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring data is aligned properly.
// Balance workload across threads to utilize more computational resources.
