```
// Consider memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns to improve global memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for reduction, which can minimize global memory access.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce latency during intermediate calculations.
// Prefetch data and use read-only cache for constant values like pi calculation factors to optimize read operations.
