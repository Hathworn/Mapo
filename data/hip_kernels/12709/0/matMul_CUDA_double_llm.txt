```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for vector1 and vector2
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize the inner loop k
// Optimize memory access pattern to improve coalescing for read/write operations
// Explore using texture memory for vector2 if access pattern exhibits spatial locality
// Ensure there are no bank conflicts when using shared memory
