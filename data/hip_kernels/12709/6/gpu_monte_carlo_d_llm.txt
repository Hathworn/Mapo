```cpp
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for the TRIALS_PER_THREAD loop to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by using padding if required
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if possible to enable compiler optimizations
// Ensure memory alignment to improve load/store operations efficiency
```
