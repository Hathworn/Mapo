// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use local variables to reduce repetitive global memory reads where applicable.
// Leverage warp synchronous programming to further reduce warp divergence.
