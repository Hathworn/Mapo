```c
// Consider using shared memory to accumulate local sums for better memory access patterns
// Ensure memory coalescing during the write back to global memory
// Avoid bank conflicts; if using shared memory, align accesses for better performance
// Optimize memory access by ensuring sum[idx] is accessed in the most contiguous fashion
// Consider using loop unrolling for the iteration loop to enhance performance
