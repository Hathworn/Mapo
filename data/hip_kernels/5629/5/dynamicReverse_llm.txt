```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access when loading from global memory to shared memory.
// Ensure all threads in a warp read contiguous memory locations to improve bandwidth.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by optimizing data layout if performance bottleneck occurs.
// Assess if larger shared memory allocation could enable better parallelism and utilization of the device.
