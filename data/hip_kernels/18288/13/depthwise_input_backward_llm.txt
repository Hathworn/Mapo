```c
// Precompute common expressions outside the loop to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like filter values if possible.
// Optimize atomic operation by minimizing its usage or using warp-level reductions.
// Ensure memory coalescing for loading gradOutput and filter values to maximize memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to handle nnSize loop efficiently.
// Adjust block and grid size to fully utilize the GPU resources based on problem constraints.
