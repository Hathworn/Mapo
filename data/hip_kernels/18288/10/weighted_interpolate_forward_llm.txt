```c
// Consider coalescing input memory accesses by rearranging data layout
// Use shared memory to cache input data to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize for memory coalescing by ensuring nnIndex and weight arrays are accessed linearly
// Consider prefetching nnIndex and weight values to reduce access latency
// Evaluate potential for loop unrolling within the for loop to improve performance
