```c
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access to input and output arrays.
// Consider using shared memory to store input data for faster access within a block.
// Ensure that nnIndex and nnCount arrays are accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Use appropriate grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Implement loop unrolling for the accumulation loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Minimize divergent branches by checking if(nnSize > 0) before the loop if possible.
