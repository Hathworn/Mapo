```
// Consider using memory coalescing to optimize memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory effectively by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Ensure the use of atomic operations only when necessary due to potential performance impacts.
// Evaluate pre-fetching techniques to hide memory latency.
// Optimize loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism.
