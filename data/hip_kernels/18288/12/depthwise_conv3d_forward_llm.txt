```
// Consider loop unrolling for neighbor points loop to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory loads and stores
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing register spills
// Examine alignment of memory allocations to maximize memory bandwidth
// Use atomic operations to prevent race conditions on output accumulator
