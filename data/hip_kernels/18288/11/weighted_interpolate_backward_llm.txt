```
// Consider using shared memory to cache weight data for better memory access speeds
// Use __restrict__ pointer qualifiers to potentially improve memory access patterns
// Optimize loops with unrolling if nnSize is typically small to enhance performance
// Compute indices outside of loops when feasible to reduce redundant calculations
// Ensure coalesced memory access by reorganizing data if possible
