```
// Use shared memory for state if possible to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced access patterns for better memory transaction efficiency
// Minimize the usage of atomic operations to avoid serialization
// Strive for occupancy by balancing warps per multiprocessor with resource allocation
// Examine if loop unrolling could reduce branch divergence
