```
// Use a while loop for improved performance by reducing control overhead
// Pre-calculate output address to reduce calculation within the loop
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for multiple threads, if applicable
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking if data is aligned properly
// Evaluate if using atomic operations can optimize specific sections, if contention exists
// Minimize global memory access by reusing values stored in registers or shared memory
