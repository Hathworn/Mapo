// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Reduce branching by ensuring conditions minimize divergence among threads in a warp.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts in case of data reuse.
