```
// Consider using shared memory to cache normalization_factor data to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns with the warp size.
// Optimize thread block size to improve memory throughput and occupancy.
// Use __ldg to load from normalization_factor if cached memory optimization is not suitable.
// Minimize divergence in the conditional statements to enhance warp efficiency.
