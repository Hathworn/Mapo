```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data_im to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data_col accesses within each warp.
// Prefetch data_im elements to registers if possible to decrease memory latency.
// Minimize divergent branches in the conditional assignment for improved warp efficiency.
// Evaluate loop unrolling on ksize_h and ksize_w to reduce loop overhead.
