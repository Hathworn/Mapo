// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve memory efficiency
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loops to enhance spatial locality and performance
// Perform boundary checks to avoid unnecessary operations
// Prefetch data to maximize reuse and minimize latency
