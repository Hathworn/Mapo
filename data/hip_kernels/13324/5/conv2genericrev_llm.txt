```
// Consider using constant memory for kernel weights to improve memory access latency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing bank conflicts in shared_output allocation.
// Attempt to coalesce memory accesses by organizing input and output data in contiguous blocks.
// Use loop unrolling techniques in convolution loops to decrease loop overhead and improve throughput.
// Explore usage of half-precision (FP16) if precision requirements allow, for better throughput on supported GPUs.
// Consider using a more efficient memory access pattern for the kernel loading loop to maximize cache hits.
// Investigate if using warp-level primitives for reduction in shared memory can enhance performance.
// Evaluate if the problem size allows for the usage of tensor cores for further acceleration.
