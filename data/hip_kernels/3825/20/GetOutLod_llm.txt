```
// Preload input data into registers to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for in_lod and num_erased
// Ensure the access to out_lod0 is coalesced to improve memory throughput
// Check if shared memory can be utilized for temporary storage to reduce global memory traffic
