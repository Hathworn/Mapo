```
// Consider using shared memory double buffering to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure loads and stores are coalesced for efficient global memory access
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure data reuse in shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use vectorized access for loading and storing to maximize bandwidth utilization
