```
// Use float4 data types to decrease memory bandwidth and improve memory coalescing.
// Unroll loops where possible to reduce loop overhead and increase performance.
// Perform vectorized operations to maximize computational throughput for float4 data.
// Consider optimizing the stride based on access patterns to leverage L2 and L1 cache better.
