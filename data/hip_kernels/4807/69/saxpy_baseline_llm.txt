```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency.
// Consider employing coalesced memory accesses.
// Utilize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts.
// Ensure enough parallelism to keep all GPU cores busy.
// Experiment with different block size configurations.
// Use asynchronous memory operations where applicable.
