```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to A for improved memory throughput
// Ensure the leading dimension (lda) supports coalesced accesses
// Prefetch data from global memory to shared memory to reduce latency
// Optimize loop unroll factor for better performance with pragma unroll
// Evaluate potential benefits of increasing block size for better utilization
// Align data structures to facilitate coalesced accesses if possible
// Consider using vectorized loads or stores
