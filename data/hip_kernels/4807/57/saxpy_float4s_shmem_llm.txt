```
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved memory throughput
// Place __syncthreads() carefully to minimize synchronization overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts
// Utilize warp-level primitives if possible to reduce synchronization
// Ensure memory alignment to fully utilize float4 operations
