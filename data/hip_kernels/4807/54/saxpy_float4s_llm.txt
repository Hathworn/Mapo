```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Use float4 data type to ensure vectorized operations and better memory alignment
// Ensure NUM_ITERS is divisible by 4 to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform step size in loop iterations
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Explore asynchronous memory transfers for improved performance
// Implement double-buffering if applicable to overlap computation and data transfer
