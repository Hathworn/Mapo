```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory reads and writes.
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase parallelism.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same memory values to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are suitable for the target GPU architecture.
