```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for float4 to increase memory access efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() to safely move data between shared and global memory.
// Batch loads/stores in float4 to exploit coalesced memory access patterns.
// Minimize warp divergence by maintaining a uniform control flow across threads.
// Consider tuning CTA_COUNT and COMPUTE_THREADS_PER_CTA to balance occupancy and resource usage.
// Leverage float4 operations to reduce instruction count and improve throughput.
