```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threadIdx.x with data structure
// Utilize shared memory effectively by minimizing bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide global memory latency
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance in the inner loop
// Optimize for register usage to prevent spills
