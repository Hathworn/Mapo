```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access
// Use memory coalescing to increase memory throughput
// Ensure that accesses to the X and Y arrays are coalesced
// Minimize use of conditional statements inside the loop for performance improvement
// Use loop unrolling to improve throughput if applicable
