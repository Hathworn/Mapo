```
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory if data is reused within blocks to decrease global memory access
// Ensure global memory accesses are aligned to reduce transaction overhead
// Prefer using __ldg for read-only data if supported by target hardware
// Optimize divergent branches by reordering operations or using conditional assignments
