// Consider aligning data in memory for coalesced access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to load chunks of mask and x to reduce global memory transactions
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring mask values are either very rare or frequent
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration per device architecture
