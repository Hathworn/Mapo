// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses and increase data locality.
// Avoid branching within kernels or minimize the impact by ensuring the majority of threads follow the same path.
// Optimize thread indexing calculations for reuse to avoid redundant calculations.
