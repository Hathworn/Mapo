```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used values like mean and variance.
// Use loop unrolling techniques if applicable to decrease instruction overhead for batches or spatial dimensions.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when accessing x, mean, variance, mean_delta, variance_delta, and delta arrays.
// Investigate optimizing the math operations by using fast math functions if acceptable precision loss is minimal.
