```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data loaded into registers
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for coalesced memory access
// Consider using float2 or float4 for vectorized memory operations
// Profile for memory bottlenecks and optimize data access patterns
