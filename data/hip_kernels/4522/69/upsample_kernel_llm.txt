```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size based on GPU architecture.
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp to decrease execution overhead.
// Explore using warp-level primitives for better performance.
