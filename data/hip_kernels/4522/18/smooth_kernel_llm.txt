```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved global memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to cache tiles of data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and improve instruction throughput.
// Optimize index calculations to minimize repeated arithmetic within the loop.
// Leverage occupancy calculators to select optimal block size settings for the kernel launch.
// Evaluate different warp sizes to identify configurations that maximize memory throughput.
