```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures with warp size
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses through shared memory usage
// Combine multiple operations to reduce arithmetic intensity and improve performance
// Optimize loop unrolling to increase SIMD efficiency
// Consider using texture memory caches for frequent data access
