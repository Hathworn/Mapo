```
// Use grid-stride loop to allow for larger problem sizes without needing more threads.
// Keep frequently accessed memory in registers to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Access mean and variance using the filter index for memory locality and reduced latency.
// Optimize thread block size to match hardware specifications and maximize occupancy.
// Utilize shared memory for temporary storage if further optimization is needed.
