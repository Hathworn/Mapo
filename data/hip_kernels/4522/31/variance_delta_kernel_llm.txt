```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads from 'delta' and 'x' arrays.
// Consider using shared memory for 'mean' and 'variance' to reduce repetitive global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling for small batch or spatial dimensions to improve performance.
// Ensure 'variance' calculation's precision with a properly set constant value.
// Consider using vectorized operations if applicable for 'delta' and 'x' arrays.
