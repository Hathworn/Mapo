// Consider using shared memory to reduce the global memory access within the kernel execution.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure image writes follow coalesced memory access for optimal performance.
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling in calculations for accessing image data.
// Explore occupancy optimizations by analyzing block and grid size configurations for maximal
