```
// Use loop unrolling to improve loop performance by reducing loop overhead
// Use fmaxf for float comparison to ensure accuracy and performance in floating-point operations
// Precompute inverse of sum to improve performance by avoiding division in the loop
// Simplified thread ID calculation to minimize computation overhead
// Optimize memory access by calculating pointers with offsets which reduces global memory latency
