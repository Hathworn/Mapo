```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if repeated access occurs
// Optimize stride length to ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Consider prefetching data to reduce latency in memory access
// Use float4 or float2 loads and stores for better memory throughput if applicable
// Ensure that ALPHA is stored in a register to reduce redundant global reads
```
