```
// Use grid-stride loops to enhance memory coalescing and exploit full device parallelism.
// Ensure that a and b arrays are stored in global memory in a coalesced manner.
// Check if the access patterns can be further optimized to enhance cache utilization.
// Recommend using shared memory to store per-block partial results for reduction operations if applicable.
