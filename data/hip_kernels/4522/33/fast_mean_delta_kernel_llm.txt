```
// Allocate resources for shared memory to reduce global memory access time
// Utilize loop unrolling to maximize thread utilization and reduce latency
// Implement parallel reduction technique to optimize sum calculation and minimize divergent threads
// Leverage warp-synchronous programming with shfl_down to efficiently reduce within a warp
// Minimize division operations by pre-computing constants outside of loops
