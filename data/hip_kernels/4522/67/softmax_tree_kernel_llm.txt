```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for e_values
// Optimize atomicMax to reduce contention by using shared memory for intermediate results
// Minimize synchronization by reducing __syncthreads() calls if possible
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern to maximize memory throughput
```
