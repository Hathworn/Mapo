```
// Optimize global memory access by coalescing reads from the input array
// Use shared memory more effectively by loading multiple elements at once
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider tiling the computation to better utilize shared memory
// Evaluate if further unrolling loops could bring performance gains
