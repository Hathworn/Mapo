```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input and output arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store input tile to reduce global memory accesses.
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed static data like filter dimensions.
// Optimize loop unrolling in the pooling window to enhance parallelization.
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries to improve memory access efficiency.
// Reduce divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency.
