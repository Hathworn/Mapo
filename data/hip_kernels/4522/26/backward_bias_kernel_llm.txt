```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads from the delta array.
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy and efficient use of shared memory.
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() calls by reorganizing computation steps if possible.
// Explore memory alignment strategies for shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
// Evaluate the effectiveness of loop unrolling, considering register pressure and occupancy trade-offs.
// Utilize vectorized memory loads if the hardware and data layout permits.
