```
// Consider coalesced memory access for reading x and writing dx.
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to improve performance.
// Ensure the use of shared memory is optimal and does not exceed its capacity.
// Minimize memory divergence among threads in reading and writing operations.
// Check if using float4 or similar vectorized types for x and dx can improve memory bandwidth.
