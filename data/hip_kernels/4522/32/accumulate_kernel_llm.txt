```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to x array for better performance
// Use loop unrolling to improve calculations within the loop
// Ensure optimal block size to maximize occupancy and shared memory utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Avoid divergence by ensuring control flow paths are as coherent as possible
