```
// Consider using shared memory to load mask data and reduce global memory access
// Optimize load pattern to achieve coalesced global memory access
// Check if loop unrolling can improve performance for conditional assignments
// Ensure that there are no bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Evaluate if using multiple warps per block improves memory throughput
