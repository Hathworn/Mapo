```
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalesced memory access by organizing data more efficiently.
// Ensure loop unrolling to improve performance in repetitive calculations.
// Minimize divergence in warp execution by aligning conditions uniformly.
// Optimize the block and grid size for better hardware utilization.
