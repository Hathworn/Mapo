```
// Use shared memory to cache data_im_ptr for reducing global memory access latency
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to optimize throughput
// Align data_col and data_im pointers to reduce unaligned memory access penalties
// Evaluate the use of half-precision data for further reduction in memory bandwidth
