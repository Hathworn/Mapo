```
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve cache utilization
// Use shared memory if there's reuse within the kernel to minimize global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning INCX and INCY to the optimal stride
// Evaluate if adjusting block size or grid size could provide further performance improvements
