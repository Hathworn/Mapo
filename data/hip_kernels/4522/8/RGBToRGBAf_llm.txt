```
// Consider using shared memory for loading data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize thread block size to improve memory coalescing.
// Ensure data alignment for float4 type in dstImage for memory access efficiency.
// Check if texture memory usage can yield better cache locality for srcImage.
