```
// Use dynamic shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Precompute total_spatial to reduce repeated calculations
// Optimize inner loop to reduce index calculations by leveraging thread indexing
// Accumulate results in shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used to synchronize threads in the block
// Calculate the final variance using all accumulated values in shared memory
