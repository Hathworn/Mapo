```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses for better performance
// Consider using texture memory for read-only access to srcImage
// Ensure srcImage and dstImage are aligned for better memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to further optimize performance
