// Use warp reduction to optimize sum computation within a block to reduce latency.
// Improve memory access patterns by reordering data accesses to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Utilize shared memory and partial reduction to minimize global memory writes.
// Consider using atomic operations for scale_updates to ensure thread-safe accumulation.
