// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for pred and truth arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Avoid warp divergence by structuring conditional operations efficiently
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved throughput
// Evaluate if reducing precision could lead to performance gains without significant accuracy loss
