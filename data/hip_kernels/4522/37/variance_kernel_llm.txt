```
// Move invariant computation of scale outside the kernel loop if applicable
// Ensure coalesced memory access by reordering data access pattern if possible
// Minimize shared memory usage by using registers for local computations
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to enhance performance
// Use atomic operations if concurrent writes are necessary in a similar kernel
