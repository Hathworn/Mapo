// Use __restrict__ pointers to optimize data access patterns
// Ensure data accesses are coalesced for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and potentially increase throughput
// Try using shared memory or registers to store frequently accessed data within the thread block
// Use ldg intrinsic for read-only data for better cache utilization
// Use atomic operations sparingly to reduce contention among threads
