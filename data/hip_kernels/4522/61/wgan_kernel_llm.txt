```
// Consider aligning data in memory for coalesced global memory access.
// Use shared memory or register memory to temporarily store frequently accessed data like 'truth[i]'.
// Ensure the number of threads per block is optimized to maximize occupancy.
// Minimize branching by using conditional assignment (e.g., ternary operators) efficiently.
// Pre-load 'pred[i]' into register to reduce multiple memory accesses.
