```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for pred and truth arrays
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring pred and truth are accessed in a sequential manner
// Minimize use of log by precomputing its result for common values outside of the loop
// Check if atomic operations are necessary or if other reductions can be applied for error accumulation
