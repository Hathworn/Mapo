```
// Optimize mean calculation by using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure alignment of shared memory accesses to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Use loop unrolling to enhance parallel execution within the block
// Consider reducing the number of synchronizations for efficiency
// Investigate the use of warp shuffle operations for more efficient reduction if block size is a multiple of 32
// Profile memory usage to potentially reduce shared memory size and improve occupancy
