```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate using the __ldg intrinsic for read-only data to improve cache behavior
// Check for possible warp-level parallelism optimization for better execution efficiency
// Experiment with increasing block size for better occupancy and performance
