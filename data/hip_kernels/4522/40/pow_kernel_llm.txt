// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing consecutive elements in global memory  
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within a block can be achieved  
// Optimize the grid and block size for full GPU occupancy  
// Use __restrict__ pointers if there are no overlapping data regions for further optimization  
// Evaluate the use of inline device functions to improve computation efficiency
