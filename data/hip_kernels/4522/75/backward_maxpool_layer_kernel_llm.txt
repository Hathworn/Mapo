```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Minimize condition checks inside loop to reduce branching
// Consider coalesced memory access when reading and storing delta
// Optimize loop iterations with further unrolling or parallel computation
// Analyze and minimize warp divergence for improved performance
