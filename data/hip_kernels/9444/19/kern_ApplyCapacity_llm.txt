```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to sinkBuffer and capBuffer for optimal performance
// Consider using shared memory if there's a data reuse opportunity to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency when accessing sinkBuffer and capBuffer
// Assess the impact of bank conflicts if shared memory is introduced
// Launch configurations should be optimized for the occupancy and block size for the specific GPU architecture
