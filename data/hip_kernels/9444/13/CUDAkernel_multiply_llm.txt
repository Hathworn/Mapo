```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data to registers to maximize memory throughput
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency
// Optimize thread block size to match the warp size for better efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if performing multiple operations
```
