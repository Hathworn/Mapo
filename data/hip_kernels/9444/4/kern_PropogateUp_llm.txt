```
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access similar data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput
// Consider using loop unrolling if applicable to decrease loop overhead
// Balance parallelism and workload within each thread to maximize efficiency
