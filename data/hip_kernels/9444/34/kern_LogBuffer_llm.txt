```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth usage
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads for max, size, and maxOut if these values do not change across threads
// Apply loop unrolling if possible for better instruction-level parallelism if size is large
// Assess if a larger block size could improve performance leveraging GPU occupancy
// Ensure CUDASTDOFFSET calculation does not introduce divergence or inefficiency
