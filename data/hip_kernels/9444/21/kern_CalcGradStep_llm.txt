```
// Use shared memory to cache input data for better memory access patterns
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes
// Consider using vectorized operations for sinkBuffer, incBuffer, and divBuffer
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by precomputing repeated expressions
// Explore utilizing atomic operations if applicable
