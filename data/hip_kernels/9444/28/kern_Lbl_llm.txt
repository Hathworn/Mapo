```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for cap and flo arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Consider pre-fetching data to shared memory in blocks to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure alignment and padding to maximize memory access efficiency.
// Utilize asynchronous memory copy functions where applicable to overlap computation with data transfer.
