// Use shared memory for input values within the block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Utilize warp-level synchronization to avoid redundant calculations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures to warp size.
// Optimize spread calculation by precomputing values that are reused across threads.
