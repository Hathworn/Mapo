```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for both src and dst arrays to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory if the data will be reused by multiple threads
// Ensure proper alignment and padding for data structures to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize loop unrolling if applicable to reduce the loop overhead
// Utilize asynchronous computation and memory transfer for overlapping operations
```
