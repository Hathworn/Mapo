```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_Data to improve memory throughput
// Use vectorized data types like float4 for loading d_Data to utilize larger memory transactions
// Preload data for constant memory when applicable to maximize use of fast memory
// Aim to reduce global memory transactions by keeping reused data in registers when possible
// Ensure kernels are fully utilized by optimizing block and grid size to match GPU architecture
// Reorder computations to minimize warp divergence within the kernel execution
// Experiment with loop unrolling for small loops to decrease loop overhead
