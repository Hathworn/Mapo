```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure coalesced memory access to maximize memory throughput
// Consider data prefetching to hide memory latency
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize cache misses
// Use texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of the texture cache
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
