```
// Consider using shared memory to cache tiles of the input data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Check coalesced memory access patterns to ensure optimal memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider computation-communication overlap techniques to hide latency, potentially using streams.
// Ensure appropriate use of __restrict__ to help the compiler with potential aliasing issues.
