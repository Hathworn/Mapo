// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed weights to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize coalesced access when loading dy.
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures to improve memory throughput. 
// Evaluate the use of memory prefetching techniques to minimize latency.
