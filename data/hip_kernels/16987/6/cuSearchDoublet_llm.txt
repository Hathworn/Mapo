// Consider using shared memory more efficiently to reduce memory latency.
// Reduce repeated computation of rM and zM by using local variables.
// Optimize memory access patterns to enable coalesced global memory reads.
// Evaluate if the atomic operations could be replaced or minimized to reduce contention.
