```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider increasing shared memory usage for further optimization
// Ensure coalesced access when loading data into shared memory
// Reduce synchronization points if possible to minimize overhead
// Use vectorized operations where applicable to enhance data throughput
