```
// Consider utilizing shared memory for access patterns to reduce global memory reads
// Use coalesced memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Align data structures if possible to ensure memory access patterns are optimal
// Minimize divergent branch operations inside loops by organizing control flow
// Pre-fetch data into registers when beneficial to reduce latency
