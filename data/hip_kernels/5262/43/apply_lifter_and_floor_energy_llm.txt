// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for lifter coefficients.
// Ensure memory alignment to improve coalesced access.
// Consider optimizing thread block size for better utilization of GPU resources.
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns.
