```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for commonly accessed data
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism
// Evaluate using atomic operations if gradInput_data may be updated by multiple threads
```
