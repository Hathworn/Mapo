```
// Use shared memory for better performance when accessing data array
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing for global data access
// Avoid using costly operations by removing ternary operator in abs calculation
// Ensure memory alignment for sharedData to achieve maximum bandwidth
// Try minimizing synchronization barriers for better parallel efficiency
