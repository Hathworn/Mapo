```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses along column-major order.
// Use shared memory to store data tiles to reduce global memory access latency.
// Unroll inner loop for potential performance improvement.
// Avoid divergent branches by restructuring conditional statements.
// Consider using warp shuffle to reduce unnecessary global memory operations.
