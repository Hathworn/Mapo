// Ensure optimal use of shared memory by reducing bank conflicts
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce __syncthreads() overhead
// Optimize data access patterns to ensure coalesced memory transactions
// Adjust step size to improve load balancing and memory efficiency
// Minimize if conditions inside loops for better branch prediction
