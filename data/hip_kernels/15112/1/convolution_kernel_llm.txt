```c
// Consider unrolling loops for performance improvement if applicable
// Explore coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Use texture memory for better cache performance if applicable
// Ensure memory alignment to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Optimize block size and grid dimensions based on hardware occupancy
// Evaluate using constant memory for frequently accessed data
// Experiment with different memory access patterns for better efficiency
