```c
// Optimize memory access by ensuring d_synaptic_efficacies_or_weights, d_time_of_last_spike_to_reach_synapse, and d_postsynaptic_neuron_indices are in global memory coalesced patterns.
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within the block is possible for d_synaptic_efficacies_or_weights or d_postsynaptic_neuron_indices.
// The use of atomic operations can serialize access; evaluate if the kernel configuration or algorithm change can reduce contention.
// Investigate if loop unrolling can enhance the throughput by decreasing loop overhead.
