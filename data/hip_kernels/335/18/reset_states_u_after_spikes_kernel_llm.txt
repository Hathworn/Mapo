// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Ensure data alignment for improved memory throughput.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Minimize the use of global memory access inside the loop.
// Assess if loop unrolling could provide additional performance benefits.
