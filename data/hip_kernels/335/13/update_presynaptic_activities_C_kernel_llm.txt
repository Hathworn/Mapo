```
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access patterns.
// Use texture memory for read-only data like d_time_of_last_spike_to_reach_synapse to reduce global memory access latency.
// Employ shared memory to cache common data elements within a block if beneficial.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data in a way that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Adjust block and grid sizes to better match the GPU's architecture to further increase occupancy.
