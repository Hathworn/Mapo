```cpp
// Combine repetitive memory accesses by storing frequently accessed arrays into registers
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for coalescing
// Ensure data is aligned to maximize memory transaction efficiency
// Evaluate potential benefits of shared memory for frequently reused data
// Check to use constant memory for any read-only data that remains uniform across threads
