```
// Use fewer memory accesses by coalescing reads of arrays `d_synaptic_efficacies_or_weights` and `d_stdp`.
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory read latency.
// Periodically prefetch data from global memory to reduce latency, especially for large datasets.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to prevent bank conflicts and achieve better performance.
// Iterate with larger grid or block size to hide latency and better utilize the GPU resources.
// Reduce the number of conditional branches and encourage warp execution by minimizing divergent branches.
