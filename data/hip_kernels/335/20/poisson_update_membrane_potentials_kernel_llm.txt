```cpp
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_rates and d_membrane_potentials_v by organizing data appropriately
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize repeated global memory accesses within the loop
// Consider combining conditional statements to minimize branching divergence
// Use loop unrolling to enhance instruction throughput when processing large arrays
