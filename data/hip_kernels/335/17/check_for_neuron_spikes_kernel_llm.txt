```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access to global memory.
// Consider using shared memory to store neuron data for faster access within a block.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Examine if the current memory access pattern can be improved by transposing data layout.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is necessary for synchronization, otherwise remove for potential efficiency gain.
// Use const memory for d_thresholds_for_action_potential_spikes and d_resting_potentials if they are read-only.
