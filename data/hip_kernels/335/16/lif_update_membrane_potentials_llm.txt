```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Prefetch data to registers before the loop for lower latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory addresses.
// Evaluate the use of half precision if acceptable for faster computation.
// Assess potential for loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead.
