```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations for improved performance, if possible.
// Ensure aligned memory access to prevent reduced memory bandwidth.
// Optimize the thread block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Re-evaluate the necessity of __syncthreads() for potential removal.
