```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for input and kernel data.
// Explore using texture memory for frequently accessed global memory.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input and kernel data.
// Implement further loop unrolling strategies for ky and kx loops.
// Allocate shared memory judiciously to reduce bank conflicts.
// Ensure thread synchronization points are minimized and efficient.
// Optimize reduction step to reduce redundant memory accesses.
// Ensure output write-back is coalesced for improved global memory access.
