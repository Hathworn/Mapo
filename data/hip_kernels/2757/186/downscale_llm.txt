```
// Consider using shared memory to cache gradOutput_data values accessed in the inner loops for reuse and to reduce global memory accesses.
// Unroll the inner loops to enhance instruction-level parallelism and potentially reduce branch divergence for small scale_factor values.
// Evaluate aligning gradOutput_data accesses to improve memory coalescing and potentially increase bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching techniques to hide latency and improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by balancing the number of active threads and resource usage per block.
