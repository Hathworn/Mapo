```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads from arrays u, v, and src
// Consider using shared memory to buffer local tiles of input data for coalesced access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads when necessary
// Combine operations to reduce redundant calculations, especially for weights and offsets
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to achieve better occupancy and performance
// Minimize use of atomic operations where possible, explore warp-based reduction techniques
