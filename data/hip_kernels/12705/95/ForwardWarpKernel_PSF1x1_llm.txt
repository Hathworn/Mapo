// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data such as flow and image row offsets
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like input images and flow fields
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data structures to warp boundaries
// Employ warp-level primitives to reduce divergent branching within conditionals
// Investigate usage of vectorized loads and stores for better memory throughput
