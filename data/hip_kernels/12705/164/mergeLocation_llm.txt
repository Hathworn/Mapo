// Consider using coalesced memory access for loc_ array to improve global memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure loc_shared size is suitable for the hardware's available shared memory
// Align accesses to x and y arrays for better memory performance
// Adjust block size for optimal occupancy and to fully utilize GPU resources
