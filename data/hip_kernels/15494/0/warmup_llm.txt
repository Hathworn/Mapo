```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Cache indices to minimize repetitive calculations and improve performance
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads accessing shared memory
// Ensure the shared memory array size is optimally set for the kernel's block size
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for further improvement
