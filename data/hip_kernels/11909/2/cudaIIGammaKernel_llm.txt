// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory access within the kernel
// Optimize warp-level reductions using warp shuffle operations for improved performance
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access for better memory throughput
// Ensure coalesced global memory access patterns for x1, x2, and x3 arrays
