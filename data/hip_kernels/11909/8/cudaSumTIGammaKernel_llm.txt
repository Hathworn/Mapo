```c
// Use shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Align data structures to 128 bits if possible to enable coalesced access
// Consider using double4 for vectorized load/store to optimize memory transactions
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy
```
