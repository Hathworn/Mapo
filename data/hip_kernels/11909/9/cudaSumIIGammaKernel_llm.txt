```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for x1, x2, and sumtable to optimize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Preload data from global memory into shared memory, if beneficial, to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use vectorized memory loads if possible to minimize memory transaction overhead and increase throughput.
// Analyze memory access patterns to ensure they align with warp execution for efficient memory usage.
