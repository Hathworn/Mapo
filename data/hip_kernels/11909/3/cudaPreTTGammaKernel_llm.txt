```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize branch divergence by using conditional operator instead of if-else statements
// Apply cooperative thread reduction for efficient parallel reduction
// Perform arithmetic operations in shared memory to enhance performance
