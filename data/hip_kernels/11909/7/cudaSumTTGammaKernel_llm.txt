```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory access speed.
// Utilize unrolled loops to minimize loop overhead and enhance performance.
// Ensure synchronization to manage shared memory usage among threads effectively.
// Consider occupancy and shared memory size optimization based on hardware constraints.
