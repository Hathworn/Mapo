```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for x1, x2, and diagptable to reduce global memory access latency.
// Increase memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in global memory.
// Consider using float instead of double if precision allows, to take advantage of faster computation.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques for mathematical operations to minimize overhead.
// Explore using asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap memory transfer and computation.
