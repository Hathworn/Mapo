```
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for better global memory performance
// Consider using shared memory to cache maxProbs and improve memory access speed
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements where possible
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring alignment to improve access efficiency
// Consider using __shfl_xor_sync for efficient warp-level reductions if applicable
