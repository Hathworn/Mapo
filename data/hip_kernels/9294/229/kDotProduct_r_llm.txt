```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use register for thread-local accumulation to optimize memory usage
// Unroll loop to improve memory throughput and efficiency
// Use single warp for final reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Write result to global memory only once per block to minimize write operations
```
