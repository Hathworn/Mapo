// Use shared memory for reduction to minimize global memory accesses.
// Leverage warp-level primitives for reduction to improve efficiency.
// Consider unrolling loops to reduce overhead in the warp-level reduction.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access when computing partial_sum.
// Align memory access patterns of dX, dY, and Y for better coalescing.
