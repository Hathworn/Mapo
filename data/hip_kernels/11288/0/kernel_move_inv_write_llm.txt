```
// Consider using shared memory for coalesced memory access
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for better performance
// Check if using memory padding can further improve access patterns
// Review block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy and throughput
