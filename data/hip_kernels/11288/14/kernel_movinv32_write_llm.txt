```
// Use shared memory to cache pattern updates to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure the initial pattern is assigned in a way that minimizes bank conflicts
// Consider using a warp-wide operation to optimally update the shared pattern
// Loop with stride of block size for possible compiler unroll to improve memory access patterns
// Consider coalescing memory accesses in ptr[i] to enhance performance
// Utilize prefetching or asynchronous copy for ptr[i] if applicable to minimize latency
