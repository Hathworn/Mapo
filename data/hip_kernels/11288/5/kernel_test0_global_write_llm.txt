```cpp
// Use unsigned int pointers for aligned memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns with bitwise operations
// Reduce unnecessary loop calculations for efficiency
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Avoid repetitive computation by updating mask and pattern efficiently
```
