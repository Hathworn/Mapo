// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures with warp boundaries
// Avoid excessive divergence by minimizing conditional branches in critical sections
// Use shared memory when possible to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize cache misses
// Consider the use of atomic operations for accurate error recording without race conditions
// Leverage loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and improve performance within blocks
