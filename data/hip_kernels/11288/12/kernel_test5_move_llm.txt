```
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate storage to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures appropriately.
// Use larger data types if possible to decrease the number of memory transactions.
// Minimize the use of divergent branches by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same code path.
