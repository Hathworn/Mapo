```
// Ensure coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within threads is high
// Check for memory bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Align memory access to the size of unsigned int for better performance
// Consider using warp-level operations for efficiency
