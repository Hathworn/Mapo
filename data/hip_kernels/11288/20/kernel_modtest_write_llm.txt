```c
// Precompute pointer increment to avoid repeated calculation
// Combine boundary check and pointer calculation for efficiency
// Minimize use of division by precomputing constants outside the kernel
// Enable loop unrolling for improved memory throughput
// Reduce branch divergence in loops with consistent patterns
```
