```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for global memory writes
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve performance
// Minimize bank conflicts by optimizing memory access patterns
// Investigate using shared memory for temporary storage
// Evaluate prefetching data to reduce memory latency
// Explore vectorized operations for improved throughput
