```
// Consider using shared memory to store MatA and MatB tiles for coalesced access
// Optimize memory access by ensuring all threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure each thread block covers a continuous block of memory in both MatA and MatB
// Leverage memory coalescing by ensuring MatA, MatB, and MatC are aligned and accessed in the same pattern
// Adjust block size to match the GPU's specifications for optimal occupancy and memory bandwidth utilization
