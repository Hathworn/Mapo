// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve latency.
// Consider additional loop unrolling for further reduction in instruction overhead.
// Evaluate potential use of memory coalescing for the global memory accesses.
// Leverage warp shuffle instructions for more efficient data sharing across threads.
