```cpp
// Align memory access for A, B, and C arrays by ensuring they are in different memory banks
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve performance
// Consider adjusting offset to be a multiple of warp size for better memory access efficiency
// Use shared memory if the data reuse allows for reducing global memory traffic
