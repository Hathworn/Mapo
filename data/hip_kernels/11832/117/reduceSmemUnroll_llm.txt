```
// Pre-fetch all elements to reduce global memory access latency
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory transactions
// Employ loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Use volatile qualifier to ensure variables are not optimized out during branch divergence
// Perform warp-level reductions to minimize synchronization overhead
// Use appropriate thread synchronization to manage shared memory dependencies
