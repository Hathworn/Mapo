// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure block size does not exceed shared memory limits.
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for reduction to avoid synchronization when stride <= warp size.
// Use loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and improve performance.
