```
// Utilize shared memory to optimize memory access and reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for both input and output arrays.
// Consider using loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance.
// Profile the kernel to identify and alleviate potential memory bottlenecks.
