```
// Use coalesced memory accesses where possible to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency.
// Explore warp-level primitives to minimize the need for atomic operations across threads.
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to optimize memory access.
// Test different block and grid sizes to find the optimal configuration for specific hardware.
