```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory access by aligning idata pointer with blockIdx
// Use __syncthreads() to manage read/write dependencies within shared memory
// Ensure shared memory is optimally utilized by loading only necessary data
// Consider optimizing the reduction for the warp level to minimize divergence
// Unroll the final warp loop efficiently and avoid bank conflicts
// Minimize the number of synchronizations to reduce overhead
// Align access patterns in shared memory for optimal performance
// Leverage loop unrolling for performance improvement in shared memory reduction
// Consider compiler-specific attributes to guide loop unrolling
// Explore potential use of atomic operations if applicable in specific contexts
