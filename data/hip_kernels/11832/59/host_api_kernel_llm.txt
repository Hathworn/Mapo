```
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergence in the loop by ensuring work is evenly distributed across threads.
// Ensure that grid and block dimensions are optimized for the specific hardware architecture.
// Consider using vectorized data types to enhance memory throughput.
