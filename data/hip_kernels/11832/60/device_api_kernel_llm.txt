// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring aligned access patterns
// Minimize thread divergence within warps to enhance performance
// Ensure memory transactions are fully utilized to improve throughput
// Consider using __syncthreads() where appropriate for thread coordination
