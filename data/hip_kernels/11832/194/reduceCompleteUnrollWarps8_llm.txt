```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase ILP.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used to synchronize threads before shared memory usage.
// Use volatile keyword to prevent compiler optimization in warp-level reductions.
// Consider minimizing bank conflicts within shared memory access.
