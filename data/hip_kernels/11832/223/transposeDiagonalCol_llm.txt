// Consider coalesced memory access by using shared memory for tile storage
// Optimize memory access patterns to enhance memory throughput
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by utilizing registers or shared memory
// Ensure use of __syncthreads() when accessing shared memory to avoid race conditions
// Re-arrange block and grid dimensions to improve occupancy and reduce bank conflicts
