```
// Consider using shared memory to cache A and B arrays for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads access contiguous memory locations
// Align data to 128 bytes if possible for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate the effects of increasing or decreasing blockDim.x depending on target hardware
