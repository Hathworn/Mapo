// Consider using shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Applying loop unrolling can help decrease the number of iteration steps.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to potentially improve memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate using cooperative groups for more efficient synchronization.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses within the warp.
