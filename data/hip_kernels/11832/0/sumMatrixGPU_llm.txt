```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access patterns
// Calculate local thread indices to map threads to shared memory
// Load data into shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads for consistency in shared memory
// Optimize global memory access by operating within bounds
