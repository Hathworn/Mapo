```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Prefetch data into shared memory for coalesced access.
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce overhead and improve performance.
// Perform in-register computations to take advantage of faster register memory.
// Streamline warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same path.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used properly to avoid race conditions.
// Replace __syncthreads() with warp-level primitives within a warp for efficiency.
