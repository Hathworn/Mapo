// Consider aligning memory to coalesced memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Optimize memory accesses with more threads per block to hide latency
// Ensure that accesses are coalesced for global memory
// Utilize warp-level primitives for synchronization and reduction
// Explore bank conflict avoidance in shared memory accesses
