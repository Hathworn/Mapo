// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses with warp boundaries
// Ensure the memory accesses are coalesced by using contiguous threads for sequential data
// Evaluate the use of larger blocks to increase parallelism and reduce overhead
// Consider loop unrolling to increase the instruction throughput
