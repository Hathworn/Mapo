```
// Consider using loop unrolling for the reduction loop to improve performance.
// Check if coalesced memory access is achieved in shared memory to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Verify that block size is optimized for the target architecture to maximize the number of active threads.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory reads and improve performance.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed the limits for the target GPU to avoid spills to local memory.
