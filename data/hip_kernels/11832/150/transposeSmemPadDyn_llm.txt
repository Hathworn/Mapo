// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider coalescing global memory access for improved performance
// Add padding to shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure boundary checks to handle any overflow and out-of-bound access
// Optimize synchronization to prevent unnecessary delays
