```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize memory access by ensuring each thread calculates its own index only once.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory.
// Ensure that offset calculations are done outside the critical path to minimize overhead.
