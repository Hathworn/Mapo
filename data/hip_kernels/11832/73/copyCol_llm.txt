```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced within warp.
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions to maximize warp occupancy.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible.
// Check if the memory can be accessed in a more cache-friendly pattern.
// Consider memory alignment to improve access speed.
// Analyze if memory access patterns can be improved for locality.
// Use __restrict__ for pointer parameters if aliasing can be ruled out.
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput.
