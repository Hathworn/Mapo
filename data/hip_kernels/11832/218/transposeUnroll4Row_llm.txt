```
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for optimal performance.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling to maximize instruction throughput.
// Align thread blocks with memory access patterns for better efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branches within blocks to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Perform boundary checks carefully to avoid shared memory bank conflicts.
