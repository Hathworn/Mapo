// Consider coalesced memory accesses when reading from g_idata to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Employ shared memory to further reduce the global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the possibility of further reducing the number of __syncthreads() calls.
// Investigate using warp shuffling instructions to optimize reduction within a warp.
// Explore optimizing for architectural specifics of the target GPU such as memory hierarchy and warp size.
