```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for g_u1 and g_u2 to suggest compiler for potential memory access optimization.
// Optimize memory access by using float4 or float2 for coalesced memory access if applicable.
// Ensure tile accesses are coalesced to reduce global memory transactions.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper indexing and padding.
// Consider using asynchronous memory transfers or prefetching for g_u2 for better hiding latency.
// Evaluate occupancy and ensure optimal block size for maximum parallel efficiency.
// Ensure __syncthreads() are appropriately placed to avoid unnecessary synchronization barriers.
