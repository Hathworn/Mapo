```
// Consider using `__ldg` for readonly global memory accesses to reduce memory latency.
// Ensure that shared memory accesses are coalesced to minimize bank conflicts.
// Try padding shared memory to avoid shared memory bank conflicts for warp-wide reductions.
// Use conditional assignment with warp shuffle functions for the last warp shuffle reduction.
// Consider the effects of occupancy constraints when selecting block size and shared memory size.
