// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for shared memory utilization.
// Optimize reduction operation by reducing stride in powers of two.
// Consider parameter tuning for block and grid sizes for hardware architecture.
// Minimize if conditions within critical performance sections.
