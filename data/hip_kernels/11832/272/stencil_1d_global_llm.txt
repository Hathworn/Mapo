// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory.
// Ensure all threads within a block load their respective data into shared memory.
// Minimize global memory access by reading required halo data into shared memory.
// Prevent out-of-bounds memory access by checking bounds during halo data reading.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory.
// Leverage loop unrolling with #pragma unroll for improved performance in calculations.
