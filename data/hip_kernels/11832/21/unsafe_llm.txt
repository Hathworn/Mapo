```c
// Optimize memory access pattern to improve coalesced memory access
// Ensure values_read is accessed in a coalesced manner for better performance
// Evaluate the need for atomic operations and reduce their usage if possible to enhance performance
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
