```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Optimize global memory access by using continuous memory access patterns
// Minimize synchronization by optimizing reduction loop structures
// Use `volatile` within warp unrolling to ensure proper memory access ordering
// Limit divergence in warp execution by optimizing control flow within warps
