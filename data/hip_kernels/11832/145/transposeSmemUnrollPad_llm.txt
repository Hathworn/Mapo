// Consider aligning the data accesses to improve coalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory efficiently by ensuring all loads are coalesced to minimize redundant memory transactions.
// Ensure that IPAD is optimized to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Use appropriate thread synchronization to prevent data hazards.
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy.
