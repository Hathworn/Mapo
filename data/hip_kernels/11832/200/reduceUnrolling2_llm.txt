// Consider using shared memory to store data for reduction to limit global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced global memory access.
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling for further reduction steps.
// Minimize divergent branching, especially within reduction loops.
