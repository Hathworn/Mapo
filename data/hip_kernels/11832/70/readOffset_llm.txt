```
// Unroll loop to improve cache utilization and reduce branch instructions.
// Use shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns if applicable.
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for better bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Preload data into registers or shared memory to reduce global memory latency.
