```
// Consider using __shared__ memory to reduce global memory access
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring sequential threads access sequential data
// Consider loop unrolling strategies if applicable for larger data sets
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance
