```
// Load inputs[tid] into a register to reduce global memory access latency
// Store outputs[tid] only once to reduce global memory writes
// Unroll the inner loop if niters is typically small and known at compile time
// Consider using shared memory if the same inputs[tid] are accessed by multiple threads
