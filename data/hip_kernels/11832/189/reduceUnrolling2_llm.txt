```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve memory throughput.
// Employ memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a sequential manner.
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve execution efficiency.
// Reduce divergent branching by ensuring memory accesses within conditional statements are minimized.
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits to prevent bank conflicts and optimize access patterns.
