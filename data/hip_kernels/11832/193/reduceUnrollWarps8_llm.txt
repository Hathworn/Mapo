```
// Use shared memory to store partial sums to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have computed their partial sums before proceeding
// Use volatile keyword to prevent compiler optimizations that might reorder operations and ensure correct in-place reduction
// Write final result from shared memory to global memory only once to minimize global memory writes
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring aligned accesses
