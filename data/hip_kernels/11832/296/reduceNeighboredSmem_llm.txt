```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring g_idata access pattern is sequential
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if aliasing does not occur for potential compiler optimization
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing the size of shared memory array if possible
// Ensure that the shared memory allocation does not exceed the limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider launching more blocks if occupancy allows, to hide memory latency
