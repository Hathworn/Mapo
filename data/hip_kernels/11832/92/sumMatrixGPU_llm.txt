// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory before proceeding with computation
// Consider thread coarsening to process multiple elements per thread for better throughput
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting access patterns if necessary
