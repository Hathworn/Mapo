```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures optimally.
// Use texture memory for read-only input data to improve cache hit rates.
// Ensure smem[] size is within shared memory limits for optimal performance.
// Prefer use of __restrict__ keyword for pointers to avoid unnecessary aliasing.
// Optimize warp unrolling to use __shfl_down_sync for intra-warp communication.
// Use of atomic operations for final reduction may reduce kernel launch overhead.
// Consider using cudaLaunchCooperativeKernel for better synchronization across blocks.
