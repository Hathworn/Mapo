```
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimal by examining stride patterns
// Check if increasing block size can lead to better utilization of SMs
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory by padding if necessary
// Consider memory alignment to improve performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword on pointers to hint compiler about non-aliasing
