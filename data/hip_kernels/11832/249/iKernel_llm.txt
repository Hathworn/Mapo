// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching if available to hide memory latency.
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize hardware utilization.
// Check for memory bank conflicts if shared memory is implemented.
