```
// Use coalesced memory access by arranging data access patterns
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory
// Ensure memory is accessed in aligned manner to maximize throughput
// Try to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to hide memory latency
