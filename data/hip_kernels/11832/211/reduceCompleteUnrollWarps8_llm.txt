// Ensure coalesced memory access by processing consecutive elements
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting access patterns
// Utilize warp-level operations using volatile variables for efficiency
// Minimize synchronization overhead by unrolling loops within warps
