```
// Consider using shared memory to load data in chunks to reduce global memory access.
// Perform loop unrolling for the reduction phase to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Align memory accesses to reduce transaction overhead and increase memory coalescing.
// Ensure data is read in contiguous memory segments to improve cache utilization.
// Use warp-level primitives wherever possible to avoid synchronization overhead.
