```
// Consider aligning data to optimal boundaries to improve memory access efficiency. 
// Utilize coalesced memory accesses when loading from global memory into shared memory.
// Ensure shared memory usage is minimized by only loading the necessary halo values.
// Employ loop unrolling for inner loops to enhance throughput via instruction-level parallelism.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses by ensuring proper padding/alignment.
// Pre-fetch data into registers to hide access latency and avoid repeated global memory accesses.
// Optimize the computation of 'tmp' by reordering operations to improve data dependencies.
// Use high occupancy settings, ensuring sufficient active warps to hide memory latency.
