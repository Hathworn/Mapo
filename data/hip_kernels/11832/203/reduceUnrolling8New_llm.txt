```cpp
// Ensure data is coalesced by accessing contiguous memory locations across threads
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for better data reuse
// Optimize the if-else boundary check to minimize overhead by leveraging warp efficiency
// Use __restrict__ qualifier on pointers to enable better compiler optimizations
// Prefetch next data elements into registers to hide global memory latency
// Evaluate potential for using float or double precision for more efficient global memory transactions
// Consider using Asynchronous Copy with Cooperative Groups if supported
```
