```
// Consider using shared memory for frequent data access to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent threads within warp by optimizing conditional branches
// Use asynchronous memory copy operations to overlap computation and data transfer
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a coalesced manner
