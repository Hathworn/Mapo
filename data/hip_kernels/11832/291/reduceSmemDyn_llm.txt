```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for g_idata to improve performance
// Minimize __syncthreads calls by using loop unrolling effectively
// Optimize warp divergence by handling warp unrolling carefully
// Replace dynamic shared memory allocation with fixed size if possible for performance boost
// Investigate effects of using 'volatile' on shared memory only at necessary points
