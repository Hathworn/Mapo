```cpp
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Apply loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Cache data in registers to reduce memory latency and increase bandwidth utilization
// Consider prefetching data if patterns allow to hide memory access latency
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations in global memory
```
