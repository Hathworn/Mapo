// Consider coalesced access by ensuring successive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory if possible to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Ensure correct memory alignment for better access efficiency
// Evaluate if using more threads per block could improve performance
// Assess the grid size and block size for optimal resource utilization and performance
