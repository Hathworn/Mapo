```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning dRand with memory banks
// Use shared memory if multiple warps access the same data concurrently
// Minimize global memory accesses by using registers efficiently
// Balance grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy
// Initialize random states outside the kernel if possible to reduce overhead
```
