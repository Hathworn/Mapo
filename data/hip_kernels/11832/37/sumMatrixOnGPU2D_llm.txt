// Consider using warp-level operations to further optimize memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing reads and writes
// Minimize global memory access by utilizing more shared memory where possible
// Align data structures to memory boundaries for improved access speed
// Use atomic operations judiciously to prevent memory access conflicts
