```c
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing to ensure threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Explore the use of warp shuffle functions for better data exchange within a warp.
// Assess if reducing thread divergence in conditional statements enhances performance.
// Evaluate using asynchronous memory copies to overlap data transfers with computations.
