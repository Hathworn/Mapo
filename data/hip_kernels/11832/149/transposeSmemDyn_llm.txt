// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper data layout
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory load
// Opt for optimal block size and tile dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Ensure in-bound checks are performed before accessing global memory
