// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data access patterns properly.
// Use loop unrolling techniques further if beneficial after profiling.
// Align data structures to improve performance by utilizing memory coalescing.
