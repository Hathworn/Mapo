```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory access.
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access the same data points.
// Reduce memory bandwidth usage by minimizing redundant data access.
// Ensure memory alignment to prevent misaligned memory access penalties.
// Balance thread workload by adjusting block and grid sizes for optimal performance.
