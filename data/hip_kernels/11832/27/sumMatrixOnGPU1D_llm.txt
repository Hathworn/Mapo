// Consider coalescing memory accesses for MatA, MatB, and MatC for efficient global memory usage.
// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate results, reducing global memory traffic. 
// Explore the use of loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput and efficiency.
// Ensure proper alignment of data to enhance memory access speed.
