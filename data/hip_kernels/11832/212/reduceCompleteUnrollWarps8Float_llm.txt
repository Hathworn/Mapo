```
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve performance.
// Balance the workload among threads to avoid performance bottlenecks.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Use volatile keyword to avoid optimizations that may hinder warp-level parallelism.
// Prefer thread synchronization over atomic operations for better performance.
