```
// Avoid long-lived shared memory usage by working directly in global memory
// Minimize synchronization overhead by limiting __syncthreads() to necessary strides
// Ensure efficient memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory regions
// Leverage warp-level intrinsic functions for better performance
