```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for MatA and MatB to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by organizing threads to access sequential memory locations.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to enhance performance within the kernel.
// Evaluate the grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
