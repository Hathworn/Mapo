```
// Use coalesced memory access for better memory throughput.
// Minimize global memory accesses by utilizing shared memory.
// Consider using __restrict__ to provide hints for memory aliasing optimization.
// Improve memory access patterns by ensuring thread utilization and balance.
// Explore half-precision arithmetic if precision constraints allow for it.
// Tune block size and grid size to exploit more parallelism and improve occupancy.
