```cpp
// Consider using shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use loop unrolling for reduction to minimize instruction overhead.
// Reduce synchronization points within the warp to optimize performance.
// Employ the use of volatile to communicate to the compiler the absence of memory caching.
