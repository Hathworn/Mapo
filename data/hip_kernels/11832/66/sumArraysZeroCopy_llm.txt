```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword on pointers to help the compiler with optimizations
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data and accessing global memory efficiently
// Try to minimize branch divergence by avoiding conditional statements in the kernel
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if beneficial
// Explore increasing the block size for potentially better performance
// Evaluate the use of different memory spaces and synchronization techniques
