```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase data locality.
// Ensure all-in block synchronization (__syncthreads()) is used correctly to prevent race conditions.
// Minimize branch divergence by keeping thread execution paths homogeneous.
// Explore using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Ensure efficient use of occupancy to maximize resource utilization.
