```
// Consider using aligned memory access for better cache performance.
// Use __restrict__ pointers to the kernel arguments to aid compiler optimization.
// Ensure idata and g_odata are declared with HIP managed memory for unified access.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find an optimal configuration for your hardware.
// Implement loop unrolling for the reduction loop to minimize warp divergence.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts within thread blocks.
// Benchmark performance with different grid sizes to leverage your GPU's full potential.
// Use occupancy calculator to determine optimal block/memory sizes to maximize throughput.
