```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory access frequency
// Employ loop unrolling to improve throughput by reducing loop overhead
// Use volatile keyword to prevent unwanted compiler optimizations when accessing shared memory
// Unroll the warp reduction to reduce the number of synchronization points
// Consider enhancing memory coalescing by aligning data access
