// Consider using shared memory to store data being accessed multiple times within a thread to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead and improve parallel reduction efficiency.
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by optimizing data access patterns within the block.
