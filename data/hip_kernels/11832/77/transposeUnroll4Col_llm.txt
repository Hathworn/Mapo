```
// Use float4 to reduce global memory transactions
// Unroll loop to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Access memory in a coalesced pattern
// Check boundary conditions outside the loop to reduce divergence
// Minimize global memory access by using registers
// Write output in burst mode to take advantage of memory coalescing
