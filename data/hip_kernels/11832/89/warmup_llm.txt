// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly
// Minimize register usage by reducing the amount of arithmetic inside the kernel
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if aliasing is not a concern
// Consider using shared memory for repeated accesses to the same elements
