```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for g_idata and g_odata to avoid potential aliasing
// Align data accesses to improve memory coalescing where possible
// Use __ldg intrinsic to read g_idata for better caching performance on newer architectures
// Implement loop unrolling and prefetching in scenarios where it can further enhance performance
// Investigate using asynchronous memory transfer to overlap data movement and computation
// Evaluate shared memory usage further to ensure it is optimal and bank conflicts are minimized
