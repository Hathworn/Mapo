```
// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory addresses
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Unroll loops to reduce loop overhead and improve the instruction pipeline
// Ensure alignment of data structures to enable optimal memory transactions
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory by considering memory layout and access patterns
// Minimize divergent branching to maintain warp efficiency
