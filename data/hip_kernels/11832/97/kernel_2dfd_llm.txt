```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Utilize __syncthreads to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory.
// Use register to minimize redundant global memory access for yval.
// Unroll loops to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Use conditional execution to avoid unnecessary computations on boundary threads.
// Ensure shared memory is aligned to avoid bank conflicts.
