```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced access when loading data into shared memory
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory operations
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce syncthreads overhead
