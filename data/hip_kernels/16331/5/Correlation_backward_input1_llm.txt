```c
// Consider coalescing memory access for gradOutput for better memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses to rInput2 are aligned to improve memory efficiency.
// Optimize loops over nOutputChannels by considering parallelized reduction techniques.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid unnecessary barriers and ensure proper data synchronization.
// Consider loop unrolling for inner loops to reduce loop overhead and increase performance.
// Evaluate bank conflicts in shared memory accesses to eliminate unnecessary wait states.
