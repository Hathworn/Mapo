```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize bank conflicts within shared memory access.
// Prioritize coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize usage of syncthreads to reduce serialization overhead.
// Ensure limited register usage to prevent register spilling.
