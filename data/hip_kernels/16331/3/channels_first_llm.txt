```
// Consider using warp-level primitives for loading/storing to optimize shared memory bandwidth.
// Avoid redundant synchronization by restructuring kernel logic.
// Analyze memory access patterns to ensure coalesced accesses for global memory.
// Investigate using vectorized loads/stores to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize register for temporary variables to reduce shared memory pressure.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for better performance in channel iteration.
