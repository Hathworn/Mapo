```
// Improve memory access by ensuring coalesced reads
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global reads
// Maximize shared memory usage by handling larger data block
// Use proper synchronization to avoid race conditions with shared memory
// Consider aligning data for further optimization in global memory access
