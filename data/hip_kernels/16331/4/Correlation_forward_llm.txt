```
// Consider coalescing memory access for rInput1 and rInput2.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Reduce global memory accesses by using shared memory buffers.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for better performance.
// Leverage loop unrolling techniques for the inner loop over channels.
// Optimize the reduce operation to minimize __syncthreads() calls.
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler with optimizations.
