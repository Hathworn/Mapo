```
// Consider using warp-level primitives to aggregate data more efficiently.
// Optimize shared memory usage by dynamically allocating memory only when needed.
// Further reduce global memory writes by utilizing a double-buffering technique.
// Use loop unrolling to enhance memory coalescing and reduce branch divergence.
