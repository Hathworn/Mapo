```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable compiler optimizations
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce latency during access
// Use atomic operations cautiously to avoid serialization and performance bottlenecks
// Arrange threads in a way that minimizes bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Investigate usage of __syncthreads() and remove if unnecessary, as it can introduce stalls
// Optimize conditional branches to reduce divergent behavior among threads
// Analyze warp execution for possible optimizations to prevent warp divergence
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory transaction efficiency
