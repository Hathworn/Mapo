```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access contiguous memory locations
// Ensure proper memory alignment to improve memory access efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Utilize warp-level primitives to further optimize memory accesses
