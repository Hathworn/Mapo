// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access to global memory.
// Reduce divergent branches by minimizing conditional checks within threads.
// Evaluate the possibility of using 2D grid and block sizes to improve memory throughput and usage efficiency.
