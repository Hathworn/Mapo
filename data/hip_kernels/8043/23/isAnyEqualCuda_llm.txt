```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for image and value arrays
// Attempt to improve memory access patterns by aligning data structures
// Evaluate potential benefits of shared memory usage for value array
// Analyze if loop unrolling could enhance performance for small valueCount
// Ensure optimal grid and block dimensions for full GPU utilization
// Investigate if avoiding atomic operations is possible for differenceCount
