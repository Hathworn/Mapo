```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring continuous threads access continuous memory locations.
// Evaluate using shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses and enhance performance.
// Ensure that input arrays are aligned to avoid misaligned memory accesses that can degrade performance.
// Explore loop unrolling if the width and height dimensions are fixed and known at compile time.
// Confirm that all accessed memory is within allocated bounds to prevent undefined behavior.
