```
// Consider coalescing memory access for better performance
// Align data structures to optimize memory access
// Leverage shared memory if additional temporary storage is needed
// Optimize block size to ensure high occupancy
// Minimize divergent branches for warp efficiency
// Use __restrict__ keyword to potentially reduce pointer aliasing
