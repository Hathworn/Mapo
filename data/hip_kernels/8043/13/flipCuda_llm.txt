// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated access to global memory for frequently accessed data.
// Coalesce memory access patterns for 'in' and 'out' arrays to improve memory access efficiency.
// Optimize the calculation of outX and outY to minimize arithmetic operations within the kernel.
