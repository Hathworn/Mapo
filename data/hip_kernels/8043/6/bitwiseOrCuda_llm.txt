```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure alignment and coalesced access patterns for in1, in2, and out arrays
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to suggest no aliasing for compiler optimization
// Improve memory locality by fetching data into registers before computation
// Check if utilizing texture or surface memory is beneficial for read-only arrays
// Consider loop unrolling if computation is intensive within the bounds check
