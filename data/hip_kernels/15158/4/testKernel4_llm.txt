```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure proper synchronization among threads
// Consider loading data from adjacent blocks into shared memory for coalesced access
// Evaluate whether boundary checks can be optimized to reduce conditional branching
```
