```
// Consider reducing the number of global memory accesses by using shared memory.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization or atomic operations to enhance performance.
// Opt for warp-level programming for more efficient data handling.
// Minimize branch divergence within the kernel to improve efficiency.
// Use coalesced memory accesses to maximize memory throughput.
// Align data structures to natural boundaries for optimal memory usage.
// Leverage constant memory for read-only data to decrease global memory accesses.
