```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Ensure proper memory coalescing by using strided access pattern
// Use atomic operations in shared memory to reduce global memory contention
// Synchronize threads to ensure consistent data in shared memory before accumulation
// Distribute shared memory initialization work among threads for balanced load
// Accumulate final results from shared to global memory strategically
```
