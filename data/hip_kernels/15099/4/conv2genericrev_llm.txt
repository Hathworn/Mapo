```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for kernel and input
// Use shared memory strategically to minimize access to global memory
// Adjust loop unrolling for kernel access to optimize memory latency
// Explore additional use of registers to reduce memory bandwidth pressure
// Ensure efficient shared memory bank access to avoid conflicts
// Optimize thread synchronization to minimize overhead
