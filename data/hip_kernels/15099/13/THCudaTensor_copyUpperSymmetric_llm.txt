```
// Consider using shared memory for caching frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Adjust the grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and ensure coalesced memory access.
// Employ loop unrolling for the main computational loop to minimize loop control overhead.
// Use the __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments if input data is not aliased, to enable more aggressive compiler optimizations.
// Verify memory access patterns to ensure no bank conflicts when using shared memory.
