```
// Consider using floating point precision that matches your compute capability to enhance performance
// Ensure data is coalesced by aligning data access patterns to memory architecture
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring each thread accesses different bank
// Optimize the number of threads to ensure best occupancy while avoiding idle resources
// Use a larger block size if possible to increase parallel processing capabilities
```
