```
// Consider increasing VT value for better memory coalescing.
// Ensure that index accesses are coalesced by aligning index values.
// Optimize stride access for efficient memory transaction.
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring memory access pattern benefits warp execution.
// Reduce conditional checks within unrolled loop for optimal performance.
