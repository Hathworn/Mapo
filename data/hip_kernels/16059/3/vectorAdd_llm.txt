```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access.
// Consider using shared memory to further improve performance.
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy.
// Align data types and ensure correct alignment to minimize misaligned accesses.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
