// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance.
// Ensure that shared memory size does not exceed the maximum allocation.
// Check for bank conflicts within shared memory accesses.
// Optimize the number of threads per block to maximize occupancy.
// Utilize vectorized operations if possible to improve throughput.
