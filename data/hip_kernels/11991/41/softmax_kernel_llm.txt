// Use shared memory to optimize data access and reduce global memory traffic
// Use atomic operations to avoid race conditions and achieve parallel reductions
// Store partial sums in shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and ensure correct shared memory utilization
// Simplify grid index calculation to reduce computational overhead
