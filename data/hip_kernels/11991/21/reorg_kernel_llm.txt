```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory to temporarily store data if there are redundant memory accesses.
// Explore the use of texture memory if advantageous for your access pattern.
// Optimize thread assignment to minimize branch divergence.
