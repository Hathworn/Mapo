// Consider using shared memory for caching data accessed within the loop to minimize global memory traffic.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data reads and writes with warp boundaries.
// Avoid divergent branches within the loop to maximize warp execution efficiency.
// If possible, use vectorized data types and operations to reduce the number of memory transactions.
