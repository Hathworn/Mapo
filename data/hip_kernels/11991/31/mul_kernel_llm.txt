// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure that INCX and INCY are causing coalesced memory accesses for better memory throughput.
// Profile memory access patterns to identify if any bank conflicts are occurring and optimize accordingly.
// Experiment with different block and grid dimensions to optimize for maximum occupancy and efficiency.
