```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Use __restrict__ for pointers if applicable to optimize memory access.
// Explore shared memory usage if the data can be reused across threads.
// Ensure data alignment for float access to avoid unaligned memory access.
// Check for warp divergence due to conditional statements and optimize them.
