```
// Consider minimizing divergence by ensuring warp execution paths are similar
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for faster access
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring bank conflicts are minimized
// Consider unrolling loops where applicable for performance improvement
// Use __restrict__ keyword for weights and binary pointers to potentially help compiler optimizations
