```
// Consider using shared memory for data_im_tile to reduce global memory transactions
// Use vectorized memory access for data_im_ptr and data_col_ptr to improve memory throughput
// Ensure memory alignment where possible to take advantage of coalesced memory access
// Prefetch data for the next iteration to hide memory latency
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring boundary checks
