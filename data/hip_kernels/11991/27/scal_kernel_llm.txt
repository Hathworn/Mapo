```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring adjacent threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use vectorized memory operations if the hardware supports it for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure INCX does not lead to non-coalesced memory accesses, adjust if necessary
// Consider using occupancy metrics to determine optimal block and grid sizes for GPU utilization
