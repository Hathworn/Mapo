```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for coalesced access
// Ensure dimensions are valid and avoid unnecessary calculations within kernels
// Optimize loop unrolling if possible to reduce overhead
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to pointers if no aliasing occurs to improve compiler optimizations
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing conditional checks
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize read latency
