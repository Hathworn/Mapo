```cpp
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by aligning shared memory allocation to warp size.
// Use loop unrolling to improve instruction pipeline utilization in the innermost loop.
// Consider adjusting the number of threads per block to ensure efficient GPU occupancy.
// Ensure there's enough shared memory to handle the total number of threads in a block.
