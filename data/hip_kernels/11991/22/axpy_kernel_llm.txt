```
// Use a 1D grid when possible to simplify index calculation and maximize occupancy
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve performance
// Optimize ALPHA value handling using registers to reduce memory traffic
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant loading of data
// Use vectorized loads to efficiently utilize memory bandwidth
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp perform the same instruction
