// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve cache hit rate
// Consider using texture memory for out_delta if spatial locality of access pattern is high
// Ensure the kernel is launched with enough threads to fully utilize GPU resources
// Investigate possibility of using atomic operations if concurrent writes to in_delta become an issue
