```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for intermediate sums
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring optimal shared memory access patterns
// Use atomic operations only when necessary to avoid serialization issues
// Consider loop unrolling to improve data parallelism within loops
// Ensure coalesced accesses to global memory for improved memory bandwidth
```
