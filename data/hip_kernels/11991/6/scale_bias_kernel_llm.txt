```
// Consider using cooperative groups for finer synchronization control
// Optimize shared memory usage based on actual maximum block size
// Check for balanced grid and block dimensions for better occupancy
// Investigate if loading biases by multiple threads improves performance
// Ensure that shared memory size does not exceed the limit per block
// Analyze if loop unrolling could benefit performance in some cases
// Ensure efficient use of registers to avoid spilling into global memory
