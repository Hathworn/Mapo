```
// Use shared memory to store partial sums to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize divergent branches by using uniform conditions
// Align data allocations to 256 bytes for better memory performance
// Prefetch data from global memory into registers before arithmetic operations
// Ensure coalesced access patterns when reading 'delta' and writing 'mean_delta'
