```cpp
// Consider optimizing this code via memory coalescing for the delta and prev_delta arrays
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure coalesced access patterns by aligning memory access among threads within a warp
// Investigate potential use of vectorized memory operations for improved throughput
// Evaluate the possible impact of bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Explore possible reduction of atomic operations to enhance performance
