```cpp
// Consider increasing the unrolling factor if register usage allows
// Use __restrict__ to potentially enable memory optimizations if applicable
// Ensure coalesced access by striding threads through memory
// Investigate the use of wider types (such as float4) for memory transactions
// Align shared memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize the reduction with warp-level primitives if possible
// Consider occupancy settings to balance between resource utilization
```
