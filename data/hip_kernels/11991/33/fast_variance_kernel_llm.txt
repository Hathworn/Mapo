// Consider using memory coalescing to improve global memory access
// Explore using shared memory more effectively to reduce global memory reads
// Consider adjusting the grid and block dimensions for better occupancy
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling further for potential gains
// Check whether reducing __syncthreads() calls could improve performance
