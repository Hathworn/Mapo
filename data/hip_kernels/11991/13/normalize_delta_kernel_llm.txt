```
// Use shared memory to cache mean and variance values per block if reuse across threads.
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for x and delta arrays.
// Use loop unrolling for spatial batch calculations to reduce redundant computations.
// Optimize memory access by aligning data structures.
