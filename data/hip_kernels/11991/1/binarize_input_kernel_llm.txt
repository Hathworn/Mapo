// Consider coalesced memory access for input array for better performance.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by ensuring alignment with typical memory access patterns.
// Ensure all threads participate in loading data to shared memory to avoid idle threads.
// Optimize the way mean is calculated by reducing redundant operations across threads.
