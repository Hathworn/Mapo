```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within each block.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses in loops.
// Experiment with increasing block size and grid size to fully utilize the GPU's parallelism.
// Minimize register usage and explore using local memory for variables that don't need to persist outside loops.
