// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and optimize bandwidth.
// Pre-compute the commonly used variables and store them in local variables to reduce redundant computations.
// Investigate whether loop unrolling for the nested loops could improve performance.
// Verify coalesced memory accesses for data_col and data_im to maximize memory throughput.
// Assess the potential benefits of using texture or surface memory for reading data_col.
