```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within the loop.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is placed correctly to avoid synchronization issues.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by accumulating results in registers.
// Leverage loop unrolling to optimize the loop performance, if applicable.
