```c
// Consider using shared memory for 'x' and 'delta' to optimize memory access patterns
// Use loop unrolling techniques to minimize the loop overhead further
// Ensure coalesced memory access to 'x' and 'delta' for efficient global memory reads
// Consider using constant memory for 'mean' and 'variance' if they are not changing during execution
// Optimize the reduction using warp-level primitives for better performance
