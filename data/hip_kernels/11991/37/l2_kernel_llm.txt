```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to improve memory access performance
// Ensure pred and truth arrays are in global memory for coalesced access
// Align memory access for pred and truth to avoid misaligned memory transactions
// Use shared memory if block-level data reuse is high
// Consider prefetching data to registers for repeated access
// Evaluate thread block size for best occupancy and performance balance
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on GPU architecture and occupancy calculators
