```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to leverage faster memory access within a block
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring memory accesses are well-aligned
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and improve ILP
