```
// Consider using shared memory to cache sparseData for better memory access patterns
// Use cooperative groups to further optimize synchronization, if necessary
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ keyword for potentially improved memory access performance
// Profile to determine if occupancy can be improved by adjusting block size
