```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for xW, sU, b to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to cache xW, sU, b for each j to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize data alignment to avoid unaligned memory accesses.
// Leverage memory access patterns by ensuring block size matched to the memory layout.
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency.
