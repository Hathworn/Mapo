// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Use the loop unrolling technique to improve loop performance.
// Consider memory coalescing to enhance global memory access efficiency.
// Investigate the use of half-precision floats to save memory and increase performance.
// Evaluate the benefits of using vectorized operations for memory reads and writes.
