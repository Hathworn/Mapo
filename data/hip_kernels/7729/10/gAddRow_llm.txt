// Consider using shared memory for data that is frequently accessed by threads in the same block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring data is coalesced, which can significantly enhance memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied in your specific context to improve instruction-level parallelism and reduce overhead.
// Use more warp-aware programming techniques to reduce divergence, ensuring threads within a warp follow similar code paths.
// Consider adjusting block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and ensure efficient utilization of available compute units.
