```
// Ensure proper memory coalescing by aligning data structures
// Minimize global memory accesses with efficient memory usage
// Consider shared memory usage for intermediate results to reduce global memory interaction
// Unroll loops to optimize throughput, adjust unrolling factor based on hardware
// Use atomic operations only if necessary due to expensive nature
