// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Optimize shared memory utilization to minimize global memory usage
// Implement loop unrolling in kernel operations for performance
// Explore warp-level parallelism to improve thread efficiency
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data
// Ensure proper memory alignment for better performance
// Optimize grid and block size for maximum occupancy
// Minimize latency by reducing thread divergence
