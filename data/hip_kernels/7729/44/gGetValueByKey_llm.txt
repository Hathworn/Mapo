```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data in contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if beneficial
// Consider using constant memory for frequently accessed static data
// Evaluate the impact of memory bank conflicts and optimize if necessary
// Optimize for warp efficiency to minimize divergence
// Use loop unrolling if beneficial for increasing instruction level parallelism
