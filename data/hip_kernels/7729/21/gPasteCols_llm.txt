```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Reduce the usage of atomic operations by restructuring data layout if feasible
// Ensure alignment of data structures for efficient memory loading
// Explore the use of shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to ensure maximum occupancy
// Minimize divergence in thread execution paths for improved performance
