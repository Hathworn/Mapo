```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread accesses to contiguous blocks
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency where possible
// Ensure optimal block size and grid size to maximize occupancy and throughput
// Avoid branch divergence by simplifying conditional statements in critical sections
// Utilize the __restrict__ qualifier where applicable to improve data access patterns
// Consider using different memory spaces (shared, constant) for mask data if access pattern allows
