```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning source and destination columns
// Use shared memory for better reuse within blocks
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize global memory access latency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring warp synchronous operations
```
