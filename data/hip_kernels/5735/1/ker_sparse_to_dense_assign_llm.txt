```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to src and idx if possible
// Check if using shared memory can help reduce global memory accesses
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied to improve performance
// Ensure that block and grid sizes are optimized for the target hardware
// Profile memory access patterns to identify potential bottlenecks
