```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure idx is stored in shared memory if it is accessed multiple times to improve access speed
// Make sure src and trg are aligned to avoid uncoalesced memory accesses
// Use warp shuffle or warp voting functions if applicable to handle reduction within a warp
```
