```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by considering reordering of idx
// Make use of shared memory if idx access patterns exhibit spatial or temporal locality
// Ensure src and trg are aligned on 128-bit boundaries to leverage vectorized memory operations
// Evaluate the impact of using __restrict__ pointers for src, trg, and idx to increase compiler optimization
