```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses for the same data
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning the thread access patterns
// Optimize loop unrolling to enhance throughput in standardize data segment
// Consider using atomic operations for sum and mean calculation to minimize race conditions
```
