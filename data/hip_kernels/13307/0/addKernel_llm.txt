```cpp
// Use shared memory to store a portion of the input arrays for faster access
// Optimize block and grid size for maximizing occupancy and minimizing divergence
// Consider memory coalescing to enhance global memory access efficiency
// Prefetch data into cache to minimize global memory latency
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied for further performance gains
```
