```
// Use a loop to initialize min_Idx to improve shared memory access efficiency.
// Combine the two if conditions for better warp execution and avoid divergence.
// Use atomic operations carefully to prevent serialization of threads.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for out and out_pos to optimize performance.
