```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for inputs for better memory efficiency
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure all threads in a block synchronize after shared memory operations
// Avoid excessive shared memory use, optimize synchronization points
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning memory access patterns
