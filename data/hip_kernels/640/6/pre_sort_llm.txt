```
// Consider aligning accessed memory to cache line boundaries for improved performance.
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize use of shared memory banks to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure that there is no unnecessary synchronization that could be a performance bottleneck.
// Optimize the usage of atomic operations to reduce contention and improve parallelism.
// Use warp-level primitives for scan operations to leverage hardware synchronization and reduce latency.
