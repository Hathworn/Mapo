```c
// Ensure all threads within a block finish initialization of shared memory before proceeding
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory by using offset indexing if possible
// Avoid using atomic operations in high-contention scenarios, explore warp-level primitives as alternatives
// Ensure __syncthreads() usage correctly reflects synchronization needs after shared memory writes
// Consider padding shared memory to prevent bank conflicts in the shared memory histogram update
// Use coalesced accesses to global memory when writing shared memory results back to global memory
```
