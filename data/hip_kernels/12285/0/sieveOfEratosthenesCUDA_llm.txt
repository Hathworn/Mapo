```
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to store data frequently accessed by threads in a block.
// Minimize branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Align memory allocations to improve memory access speed.
// Launch kernels with an optimal number of threads per block for better utilization.
