```
// Use shared memory if data is repeatedly accessed
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'a' and 'b'
// Ensure 'c', 'a', 'b' have aligned memory access for best performance
// Optimize thread block size to achieve maximum warp efficiency
// Consider using __ldg for read-only data to use read-only cache
// Minimize register usage by optimizing arithmetic intensity
// Explore using HIP's vector types for potentially reduced memory transactions
