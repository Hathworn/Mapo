```
// Consider coalesced memory access for x, y, z, and r arrays
// Strive to optimize memory access patterns to minimize latency
// Evaluate shared memory usage where applicable for further optimization
// Investigate compiler flags for potential loop unrolling
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better memory efficiency
