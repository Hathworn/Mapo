```
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring `x`, `y`, `z`, and `r` are accessed in a linear fashion
// Align data to cache line size to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to constant data to reduce global memory loads
// Minimize data transfers by ensuring all required data fits within GPU memory
// Optimize memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts
```
