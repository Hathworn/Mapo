// Use shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Accumulate values using local variables before storing them in shared memory.
// Ensure that shared memory accesses are coalesced for better memory performance.
// Consider loop unrolling for the reduction phase to enhance execution speed.
// Use volatile pointers to prevent unnecessary compiler optimizations.
