```
// Use shared memory to cache data for each block to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring predmap, indmap, indlogpred, and correctprobs are accessed consecutively
// Avoid branch divergence by using branchless conditional operations already implemented
// Prefetch data to registers when possible to reduce memory latency
// Optimize loop unrolling for the per_thread_case loop to reduce loop overhead
