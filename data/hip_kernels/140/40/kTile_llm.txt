```
// Consider using shared memory if the same src data is accessed repeatedly by multiple threads to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by organizing the src and tgt data structures effectively.
// Optimize stride-based loop for thread divergence by pooling contiguous memory accesses.
// Assess memory alignment requirements to ensure fastest access and reduce potential stalls.
// Evaluate potential register usage to minimize memory latency and maximize throughput.
