```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads for labels array
// Pre-fetch maxProbs[tx] and store in a register to reduce redundant global memory reads
// Minimize use of branching by using __shfl_sync() for warp-wide reduction of numMax computation
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for numMax for more efficient reduction
// Use atomic operations cautiously when updating shared or global memory to avoid race conditions
