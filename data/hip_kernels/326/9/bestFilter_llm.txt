```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to data array for improved bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to store data from global memory for better access patterns in the kernel
// Evaluate loop unrolling for the for-loop iterating over Nfilt to reduce dynamic indexing overhead
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to 32 bytes for optimal performance on modern GPUs
// Check if const qualifier can be added to pointers such as mu, lam, and nu that do not change
// Assess if prefetching data for tid0 +/-1 indices can be beneficial to hide memory latency
