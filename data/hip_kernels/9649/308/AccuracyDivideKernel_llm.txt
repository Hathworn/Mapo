```cpp
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data when possible.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce thread divergence.
// Profile and fine-tune block and grid sizes for optimal hardware utilization.
