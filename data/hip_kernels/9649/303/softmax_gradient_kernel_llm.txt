```
// Load inputs into shared memory to improve memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling to maximize instruction throughput
// Implement warp-level reductions for faster parallel reduction
// Consider cooperative groups for more flexible synchronization
// Use memory coalescing to access global memory efficiently
