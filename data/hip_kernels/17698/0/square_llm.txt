```
// Use __restrict__ pointer to allow compiler optimizations on memory access
// Consider memory coalescing for better performance on modern GPUs
// Suggest using shared memory if data is accessed multiple times by threads
// Ensure optimal grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Verify alignment of data structures for best memory access efficiency
