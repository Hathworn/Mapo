// Use shared memory or registers for intermediate computations to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread-level control flow to avoid warp divergence
// Use cooperative launch to ensure efficient synchronization among threads
// Consider restructuring kernel execution to eliminate single-thread bottleneck
