```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing loads from global memory where possible
// Ensure that threads within a warp access contiguous memory to improve memory coalescing
// Consider using more shared memory if it helps to reduce global memory accesses
// Check if reducing the size of shared memory chunks can lead to better occupancy
// Streamline thread indexing calculations to minimize arithmetic compute overhead
// Ensure that the use of shared memory does not lead to bank conflicts
// Evaluate aligning data in shared memory to match warp memory access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling for small fixed-size loops to improve execution efficiency
// Evaluate the grid and block size configuration for better SM occupancy and efficiency
// Ensure boundary checks do not introduce unnecessary divergent branching within warps
