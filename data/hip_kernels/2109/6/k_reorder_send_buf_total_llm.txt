```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_bidx, d_sums, d_xi4, d_pxi4
// Minimize divergence by aligning branches with warp boundaries
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could improve performance given the access patterns
// Consider reducing stride if the number of particles is less than optimal for current grid configuration
