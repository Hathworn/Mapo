// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory access.
// Precompute expressions to reduce repetitive computation.
// Utilize __ldg intrinsic for faster read-only memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing during reduction operations.
// Adjust shared memory size to match common block size for better performance.
// Limit stride range to valid indices to prevent unnecessary computations.
// Synchronize threads appropriately to ensure correct shared memory usage.
