```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider restructuring data to achieve better memory access patterns
// Minimize thread divergence by handling conditional branches efficiently
// Consider pre-fetching data to shared memory for improved access times
// Optimize the reduction operation with warp-level primitives if possible
