```
// Consider using __restrict__ to potentially aid optimizing memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for field array to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize the use of repeated calculations by storing reused values in variables.
// Align data structures to ensure optimal memory usage and avoid bank conflicts.
// Take advantage of shared memory if the algorithm can benefit from it.
// Ensure that idx does not exceed the bounds of the allocated memory for field.
