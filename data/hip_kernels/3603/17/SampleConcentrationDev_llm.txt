```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads from cellStartEnd
// Consider using shared memory to store cellStartEnd values if multiple threads access the same data
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by tuning block size and grid size
// Avoid potential bank conflicts when using shared memory
