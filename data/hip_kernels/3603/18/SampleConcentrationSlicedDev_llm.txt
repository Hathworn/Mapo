```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'cellStartEnd' to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branching to reduce warp execution time
// Use shared memory to cache 'cellStartEnd' for repeated access within the block if applicable
// Ensure memory alignment for 'concentration' to enhance global memory write efficiency
