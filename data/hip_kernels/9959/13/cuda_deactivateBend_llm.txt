```cpp
// Minimize data reads by loading pE[id] and x into registers.
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate if shared memory can be used to store reused common terms within a block.
// Reduce divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Align memory allocation to ensure proper coalescing when accessing pA and pE arrays.
