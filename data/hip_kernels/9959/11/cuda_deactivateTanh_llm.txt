```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for coalesced reads and writes
// Investigate if using shared memory can reduce global memory traffic
// Explore using the __restrict__ keyword for potentially improved memory access speed
// Ensure alignment of data structures for efficient memory access
// Evaluate if increasing block size leads to better occupancy and performance
