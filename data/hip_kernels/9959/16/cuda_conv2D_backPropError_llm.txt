// Combine consecutive memory accesses into fewer accesses using shared memory or registers
// Perform loop unrolling to reduce branching overhead and increase parallelism
// Optimize usage of atomic operations to minimize contention and improve performance
// Precompute index calculations outside of loops to minimize redundant computations
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput
