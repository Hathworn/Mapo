// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data within blocks
// Utilize memory access patterns that maximize L2 cache efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive calculations
// Optimize block size to achieve highest occupancy
