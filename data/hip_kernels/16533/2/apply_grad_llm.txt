```cpp
// Ensure data is coalesced for optimal memory access patterns
// Minimize memory transactions by using shared memory if possible
// Consider loop unrolling to further increase throughput
// Evaluate different block sizes for the best performance
// Use profiling tools to identify memory bottlenecks
```
