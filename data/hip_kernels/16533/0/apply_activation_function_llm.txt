```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for input/output pointers to enable more aggressive compiler optimizations
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated accesses to data
// Prefetch data to local variables for better memory access patterns
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance
// Align memory accesses to coalesce global memory reads
