```
// Optimize memory access patterns to coalesce reads and writes
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp efficiency
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Ensure __syncthreads() where necessary to prevent race conditions
// Consider using vectorized data types if advantageous for the architecture
