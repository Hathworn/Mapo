```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve data locality.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring proper access strides.
// Limit kernel arguments to necessary variables to reduce register pressure.
// Unroll loops where beneficial for performance improvements.
// Utilize warp-synchronous programming if possible to enhance cooperative thread execution.
// Consider occupancy optimizations by balancing thread count and resource usage.
// Enforce memory access patterns that leverage L1/L2 cache optimally.
