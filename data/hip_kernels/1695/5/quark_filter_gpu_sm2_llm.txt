// Use __restrict__ pointers to improve memory access patterns and reduce cache conflicts.
// Ensure thread index calculations minimize warp divergence for performance optimization.
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable to reduce control overhead in GPU threads.
// Evaluate if shared memory usage can reduce global memory access latency.
