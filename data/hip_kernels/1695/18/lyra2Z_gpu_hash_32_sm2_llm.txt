```
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate data to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to indicate non-aliasing if applicable
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditional statements
// Consider unrolling loops for further performance enhancements if applicable
// Ensure memory alignment for g_hash and resNonces to improve memory access patterns
