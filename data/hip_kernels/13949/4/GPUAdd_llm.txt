```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using constant memory for any read-only data that is shared across all threads.
// Consider unrolling the loop if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure memory alignment to improve cache performance.
