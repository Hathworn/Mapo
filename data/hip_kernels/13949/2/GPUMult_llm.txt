```
// Consider using shared memory to cache tiles of matrices A and B.
// This will reduce global memory accesses significantly.
// Ensure that threads within a block collaboratively load data into shared memory.
// Implement loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput.
// Verify memory coalescing for optimal access patterns.
// Optimize thread block size to fully utilize GPU resources.
