```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for ia, ib, and ic
// Use shared memory if frequent reuse of data is possible
// Ensure each thread accesses contiguous memory locations where feasible
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could offer performance improvement
// Utilize warp-level primitives for potential reduction opportunities
// Minimize divergence by ensuring conditional branches are minimal
```
