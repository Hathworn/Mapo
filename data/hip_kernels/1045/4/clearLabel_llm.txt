```cpp
// Use grid stride loop to improve parallelism and scalability.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Minimize shared memory usage to reduce resource contention.
// Consider using __syncthreads if there is any inter-thread dependency.
// Prefetch data to shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data are needed.
// Optimize block and grid sizes to match the GPU architecture for better occupancy.
// Use appropriate memory space for data based on access patterns.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
