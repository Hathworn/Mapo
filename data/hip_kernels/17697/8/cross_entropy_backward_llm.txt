```
// Use __restrict__ to help the compiler with memory access optimizations.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for x, dx, and t arrays.
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if necessary.
// Ensure dx[tid], x[tid], and t[tid] are accessed in a cache-friendly manner.
// Consider vectorized operations if architecture supports it.
