```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global reads
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls by reducing unnecessary synchronizations
// Consider bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Utilize warp shuffle operations to reduce __syncthreads() within warp
// Align global memory access to optimize bandwidth utilization
```
