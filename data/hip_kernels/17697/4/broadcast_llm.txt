```
// Use shared memory to cache elements from `x` to reduce global memory access.
// Prefetch `x` elements into shared memory for coalesced memory access.
// Ensure that block sizes are optimized for the GPU architecture for better occupancy.
// Consider using loop unrolling to improve performance if `c` is a compile-time constant.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory for optimal performance.
