// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by using stride loop.
// Use shared memory if reused data can be loaded multiple times.
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and reduce idle threads.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for operations that can benefit from reduced latency.
