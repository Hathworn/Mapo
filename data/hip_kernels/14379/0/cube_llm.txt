```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_in and d_out
// Ensure memory alignment for d_in and d_out
// Use shared memory if there are access patterns that can benefit from it
// Explore using float3 or float4 for better memory access patterns if applicable
// Vectorize operations if the hardware and problem size allow
