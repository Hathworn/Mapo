```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory for each thread
// Write each thread's maximum to shared memory
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory is fully populated
// Reduce maximum across all threads in block
// Write the block's maximum to global memory
// Synchronize to ensure block maximum is written before next iteration
