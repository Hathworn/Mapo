```
// Consider reorganizing data access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within each block
// Ensure that the size of blockDim is chosen to optimize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
// Prefetch data to registers if it will be reused multiple times in calculations
