// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize global memory writes by aggregating results in shared memory
// Synchronize threads effectively to ensure correct accumulation of intersection counts
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading proposals_idx
// Balance load across threads by distributing instances to different thread blocks
