```
// Utilize coalesced access pattern when loading from global memory
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing the use of shared memory
// Use loop unrolling for the smallest loop to improve performance
// Ensure data is aligned to prevent misaligned memory accesses
