```
// Reduce global memory accesses by leveraging shared memory for intermediate computations
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure proper synchronization when updating or reading shared memory
// Store computed means in shared memory before writing to global memory to minimize global writes
// Allocate enough shared memory to handle all threads' intermediate data to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize loop execution by reducing warp divergence through balanced iterations across threads
