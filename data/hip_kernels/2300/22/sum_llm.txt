```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to improve coalescing.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts during partial sum accumulation.
// Ensure that numElements is a multiple of blockDim.x * gridDim.x for full utilization.
// Use double buffering in shared memory to optimize reduction step.
// Try increasing block size if hardware allows to reduce loop iterations.
