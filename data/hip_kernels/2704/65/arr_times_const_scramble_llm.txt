```
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to help compiler optimize memory access
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for better ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use warp-wide operations to minimize divergence
// Pre-fetch data to registers to hide memory latency
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores if applicable
