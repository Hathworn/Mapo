```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data from global memory.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by having threads access sequential memory locations.
// Use register variables to store frequently used variables to reduce memory latency.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be beneficial for repeated operations within the kernel.
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal occupancy and maximum memory bandwidth utilization.
