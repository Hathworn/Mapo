```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure that the block size is a multiple of the warp size (typically 32) to maximize device utilization.
// Minimize divergent branches by keeping the number of threads per block as a power of two if possible.
// Use shared memory if further optimization of memory access patterns is required.
