```c
// Use shared memory if access patterns are not coalesced to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to enhance memory bandwidth
// Ensure input and output arrays are aligned to 128 bytes for better memory throughput
// Adjust block size for optimal occupancy and performance
```
