```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by reorganizing data storage if possible
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring the block size fits the data dimensions
// Use shared memory if reuse of data within the block is high to reduce global memory loads
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if memory alignment permits
