// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for 'a' and 'c' arrays.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Implement prefetching techniques to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Align memory accesses to improve throughput.
// Try using float2 data type for combined reads and writes to optimize memory transactions.
