// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Try to use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring threads access continuous memory locations
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by choosing the optimal block size and grid size
// Explore the use of memory access pattern optimizations like loop unrolling or prefetching
