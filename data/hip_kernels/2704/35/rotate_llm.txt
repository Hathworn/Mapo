```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing in the id computation
// Adjust thread and block settings to balance between limiting divergence and maximizing occupancy
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls to minimize synchronization overhead
// Evaluate loop unrolling for small loops to mitigate loop overhead
