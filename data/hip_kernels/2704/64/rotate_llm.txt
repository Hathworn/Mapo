```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses in the c array for better performance
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied to inner loops for performance gain
// Utilize constant memory for variables that do not change during kernel execution
// Ensure branch divergence is minimized, especially with if-conditions
