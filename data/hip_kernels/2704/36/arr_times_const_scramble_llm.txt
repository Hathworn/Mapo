```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced; align data to warp size if possible.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Use loop unrolling techniques if the number of iterations is known and constant.
// Arrange data to increase the likelihood of cache hits, potentially improving cache locality.
