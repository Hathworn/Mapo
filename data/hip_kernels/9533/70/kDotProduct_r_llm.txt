```
// Implement loop unrolling with 8x increments to improve memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory access
// Apply tree-based reduction in shared memory to efficiently combine results
// Ensure synchronization between threads during reduction to avoid race conditions
// Use volatile for shared memory access to prevent compiler optimization issues
```
