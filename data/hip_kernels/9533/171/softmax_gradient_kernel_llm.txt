```
// Consider using memory coalescing when accessing Y, dY, and dX.
// Use float4 vector loads/stores for Y and dY when dim is a multiple of 4.
// Ensure that dim is always a multiple of blockDim.x for best performance.
// Minimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts during reduction.
// Optimize warp-level reduction by using shuffling (e.g., __shfl_down).
// Eliminate unnecessary __syncthreads() to improve kernel efficiency.
