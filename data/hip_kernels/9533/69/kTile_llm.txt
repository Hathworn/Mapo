```
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory if possible to further optimize memory read efficiency.
// Consider unrolling the loop to decrease loop overhead and improve performance.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size to ensure maximum GPU resource utilization.
// Experiment with using different data types to improve memory access speed and throughput.
