// Consider coalescing memory accesses for probs array
// Consider using shared memory for maxp and labelp computations to reduce global memory access
// Evaluate bank conflicts in shared memory operations if shared memory is implemented
// Use __syncthreads() if shared memory and block-level operations are added for accuracy and consistency
