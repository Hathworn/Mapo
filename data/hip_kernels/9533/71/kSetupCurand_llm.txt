// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by using contiguous thread indices
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by properly aligning data access
// Utilize shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize block size and grid configuration for maximum occupancy and performance
// Consider using streams for overlapping data transfer and kernel execution
