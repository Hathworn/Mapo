// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve global memory throughput
// Inspect the possibility of loop unrolling for further optimization
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
// Optimize thread synchronization to reduce overhead
