```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for reindex[] to increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory for srcArray to minimize global memory access latency.
// Employ double buffering techniques to hide memory latency and achieve higher throughput.
// Access srcArray and destArray with proper stride to maximize L2 cache utilization.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce memory access divergence.
