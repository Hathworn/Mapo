```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for pEnd and pEt to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure pEt and pEnd are accessed in a coalesced manner to improve memory throughput.
// Prefetch data into registers to further reduce the latency of global memory access.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions for improved memory bandwidth utilization.
