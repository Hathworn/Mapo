// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Use shared memory if possible to minimize global memory access latency
// Avoid redundant memory accesses by calculating indices efficiently
// Consider preferring warp-synchronous programming to minimize diverging branches
// Leverage data locality by clustering threads logically
