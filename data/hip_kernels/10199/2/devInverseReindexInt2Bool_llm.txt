```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache parts of srcArray for faster access
// Explore coalesced memory access patterns for both srcArray and destArray
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing condition checks
// Ensure that reindex is stored in faster memory, like constant or shared memory, if possible
// Consider using atomic operations for updating parts of destArray if required
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for the performance-critical sections
