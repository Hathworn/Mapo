// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to enhance memory throughput.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and enhance performance.
// Minimize divergent branching within the while loop to improve warp efficiency.
