```
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to minimize global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for a, b, and sum arrays to improve memory bandwidth
// Align data structures to cache line sizes if applicable for better cache performance
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to match the hardware capabilities
// Utilize asynchronous memory operations if host-device transfer time is a bottleneck
