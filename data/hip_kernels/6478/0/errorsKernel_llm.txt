```
// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for points and individs arrays to maximize memory throughput
// Minimize register usage by reducing the number of temporary or intermediary variables
// Use loop unrolling techniques to potentially reduce loop overhead in critical loops
// Prefetch data when possible to hide memory latency by overlapping computation with data transfer
