```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for p1 and p2 to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant global memory access if idx1 or idx2 has repeating patterns.
// Check if elmsz is a multiple of 4 or 8 to use float or double4 for larger and more efficient memory transactions.
// Ensure proper alignment of p1, p2, p1_, and p2_ to maximize memory transaction efficiency.
// Use asynchronous memory transfers or prefetching techniques where possible to hide memory latency.
