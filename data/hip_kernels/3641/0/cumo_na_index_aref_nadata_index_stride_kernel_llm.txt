// Use shared memory for idx if possible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by restructuring data access pattern
// Consider using warp shuffle for operations within the same warp to avoid shared memory bank conflicts
// Evaluate if loop unrolling would benefit performance enhancement
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform branch execution across threads
