```
// Consider coalesced memory access for idx to improve memory access efficiency
// Use shared memory if calculations occur in a repetitive manner to reduce global memory accesses
// Verify if prefetching data can improve performance, particularly if idx is accessed in a pattern
// Align idx to greater than 128-byte boundaries to benefit from better memory loads
// Evaluate if loop unrolling would reduce overhead and increase performance
