```
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern to optimize memory bandwidth
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to reduce pointer aliasing
// Prefetch data to shared memory if applicable, as it can lead to performance gains
// Align data structures to cache line size to improve cache performance
