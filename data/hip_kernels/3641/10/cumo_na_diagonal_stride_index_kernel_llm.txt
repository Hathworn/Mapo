```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for idx and idx1 to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure idx and idx1 are allocated with proper memory alignment to enhance access speed
// Utilize shared memory to cache idx1 values if multiple threads need the same data
// Minimize conditional branches by restructuring the if condition to help improve warp execution efficiency
// Prefer __restrict__ qualifier for idx and idx1 pointers if there are no aliasing concerns
