```
// Use coalesced memory access to maximize memory bandwidth
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned by using the correct memory stride
// Consider prefetching data to reduce memory latency
// Minimize divergent branches to optimize warp execution efficiency
// Utilize shared memory if data reuse within a block is present
