```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if access patterns allow
// Ensure coalesced memory access for idx1 to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Investigate employing loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead for longer arrays
// Check for opportunities for instruction-level parallelism to hide memory latency
// Assess alignment of idx and idx1 to ensure they match the expected alignment for best performance
// Explore the possibility of reducing grid-stride loop to leverage more efficient thread utilization
