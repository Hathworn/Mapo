```
// Use shared memory for blocks to reduce global memory access
// Minimize bank conflicts while using shared memory for improved performance
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for efficient computation
// Adjust thread block size to maximize GPU occupancy and resource utilization
// Investigate and apply appropriate GPU memory hierarchy strategies
