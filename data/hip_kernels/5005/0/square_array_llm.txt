```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns across threads.
// Evaluate using texture memory if accessing the same data frequently for additional caching benefits.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
