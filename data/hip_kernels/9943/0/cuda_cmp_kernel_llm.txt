```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring data alignment in global memory
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce memory accesses for aptr and bptr to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure that atomic operations are minimized by restructuring the algorithm if possible
