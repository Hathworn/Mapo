```
// Use shared memory to store data that is accessed multiple times by threads within the same block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using vectorized memory access patterns to improve data throughput.
// Align memory access to cache line size to minimize access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use constant memory for values like 2.3f to reduce memory read latency.
