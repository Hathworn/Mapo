// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed gradOutput_data
// Use coalesced memory access for both gradInput_data and gradOutput_data
// Minimize thread divergence by reorganizing loop iterations or conditional statements 
// Implement warp-level memory optimizations using __shfl_sync or similar techniques
// Align data access to minimize unaligned memory reads and writes
// Optimize 1D indexing to ensure better utilization of GPU resources 
// Reduce loop overhead by unrolling the inner loop
