```
// Consider using shared memory if multiple accesses to d_src occur
// Ensure coalesced memory access to d_src for optimized performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access to d_res for optimized performance
// Verify occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance
// Avoid divergent branches within the loop
// Explore memory prefetching techniques for better data access patterns
