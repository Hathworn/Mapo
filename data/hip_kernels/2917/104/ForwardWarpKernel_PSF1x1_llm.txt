```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Consider optimizing the warp scheduling to ensure coherent memory access patterns
// Evaluate the benefit of loop unrolling for critical sections to improve instruction throughput
// Apply vectorized loads/stores using float2 where applicable for better bandwidth utilization
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data to leverage caching
