// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for loc_ to improve global memory efficiency.
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits to prevent bank conflicts.
// Optimize scale operation to minimize arithmetic operations if possible.
// Investigate the potential for using float2 instead of short2 to reduce conversion overhead.
