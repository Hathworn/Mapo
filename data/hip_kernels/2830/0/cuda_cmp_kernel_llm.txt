// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for aptr and bptr
// Consider using a binary flag to minimize atomicExch calls
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy without exceeding shared memory limits
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
