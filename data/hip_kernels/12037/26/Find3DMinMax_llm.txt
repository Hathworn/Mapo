```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure bank conflicts are minimized when using shared memory
// Leverage loop unrolling to enhance throughput in min/max calculations
// Optimize boundary condition checks to improve performance
// Align memory accesses for coalesced global memory reads
// Consider using texture memory if it benefits the access pattern
