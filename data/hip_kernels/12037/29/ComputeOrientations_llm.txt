// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses for optimal performance.
// Prefetch data from global to shared memory where possible.
// Consider using loop unrolling techniques in the data loading loop.
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized to reduce serialization.
// Align the shared memory accesses to maximize bandwidth.
// Optimize the histogram reduction phase by further minimizing synchronization.
