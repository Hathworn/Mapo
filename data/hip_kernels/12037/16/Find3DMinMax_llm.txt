```
// Use shared memory for data caching to reduce global memory access
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve performance
// Use fminf and fmaxf functions to improve arithmetic operation speed
// Streamline input range checks to reduce conditional branches
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure memory consistency across threads
// Minimize conditional checks to improve data processing efficiency
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalesced memory reads
