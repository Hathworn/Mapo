```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory to stage data for repeated access to improve memory efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if the operation is computationally intensive
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Minimize register usage to allow more thread blocks to be active concurrently
