```
// Consider reducing shared memory usage by compressing data structures if possible.
// Reorganize data loading for better coalesced memory access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling in 'Load data' and 'Compute histogram' for efficiency.
// Check if __syncthreads() can be optimized or merged to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate performance impact of using texture or constant memory for g_Data.
// Consider using atomic operations if needed to avoid race conditions in histogram computation.
// Assess if using fewer threads per block could help improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Explore using warp-level operations (e.g., __shfl_down) for histogram reduction to enhance performance.
// Minimize branch divergence in orientation peaks computation by restructuring control flow if needed.
// Evaluate if more precise Gaussian function computation can be traded for speed if tolerated.
