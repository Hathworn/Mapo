```
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for better memory throughput.
// Use __restrict__ pointers for 'd_Result' and 'd_Data' to assist the compiler in optimization.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve access speed.
// Evaluate if 'kernel' can be stored in shared memory for reduced global memory access.
// Optimize alignment of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
