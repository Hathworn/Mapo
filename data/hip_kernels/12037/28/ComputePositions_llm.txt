```
// Consider using shared memory to cache g_Data2 data for better memory access patterns
// Ensure g_Data2 access is coalesced by organizing data layout appropriately
// Load data elements into registers once and reuse them to reduce global memory access
// Perform bounds checking before accessing g_Data2 to avoid unnecessary computations
// Avoid divergent branches by ensuring all threads in a warp have similar logical flow
// Store results in d_Sift with aligned memory accesses to enhance coalescing
