```
// Use shared memory for faster access and lower latency.
// Optimize block size to improve memory coalescing and reduce cache misses.
// Reduce global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in shared memory.
// Use loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring consistent conditional execution within warps.
// Perform binary reduction to minimize the number of operations and improve efficiency.
