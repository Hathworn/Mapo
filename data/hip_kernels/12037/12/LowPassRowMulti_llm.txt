```
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by avoiding bank conflicts
// Implement loop unrolling in the computation section to reduce loop overhead
// Use constant memory for the kernel to optimize repeated access
// Minimize shared memory usage by loading only necessary data based on thread responsibilities
// Ensure proper alignment of memory accesses to meet hardware requirements
// Leverage asynchronous memory prefetching if applicable for data loads
