```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory throughput
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
