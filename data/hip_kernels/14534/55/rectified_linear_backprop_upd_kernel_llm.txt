```
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring data is accessed in contiguous memory patterns.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures to enhance fetch efficiency.
// Minimize branch divergence by reducing conditional branches within critical loops.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can provide performance benefits.
// Check if warp-synchronous programming can further optimize execution efficiency.
// Use vectorized operations where applicable to take advantage of hardware capabilities.
