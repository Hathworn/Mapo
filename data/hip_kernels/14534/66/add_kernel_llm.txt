```
// Consider using __restrict__ to increase the potential for compiler optimizations.
// Ensure __restrict__ is used correctly to indicate that pointers do not alias other pointers.
// Use early exit to reduce time on unnecessary computations for threads outside the range.
// Leverage float4 to minimize memory transactions and take advantage of vectorized operations.
// Perform computation and assignment in a single step to reduce latency and improve performance.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to maximize memory throughput.
