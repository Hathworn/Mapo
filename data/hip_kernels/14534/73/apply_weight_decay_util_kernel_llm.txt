```
// Use __ldg() to optimize read access from global memory
// Combine multiple float4 operations into a single operation if possible
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive operations
// Ensure coalesced memory access to maximize memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory access
// Investigate if adjusting block size improves performance based on device occupancy analysis
