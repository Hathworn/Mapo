// Consider coalesced memory access for input and output arrays
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results if multiple threads need to access them
// Ensure efficient use of registers by minimizing variable usage
// Align data structures to ensure proper usage of vectorized operations
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling if applicable
