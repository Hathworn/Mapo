```
// Use shared memory for storing intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align memory access patterns to enable coalesced memory access.
// Use loop unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Minimize thread divergence and synchronize threads efficiently with __syncthreads().
// Optimize for shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts.
// Ensure alignment of input data to enable vectorized loads and stores.
