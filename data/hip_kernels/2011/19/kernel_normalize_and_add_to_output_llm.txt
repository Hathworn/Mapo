```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for dev_accumulate_weights and dev_accumulate_values
// Employ warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations within the warp
// Avoid bank conflicts when utilizing shared memory
// Minimize divergent branches to ensure consistent execution paths within warps
