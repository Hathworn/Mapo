```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used values
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure that beta is read from constant memory to take advantage of faster access times
// Minimize the number of accesses to global memory by using registers to store temporary computations
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead caused by loop control
// Balance workload across blocks and threads to maximize occupancy and utilization
