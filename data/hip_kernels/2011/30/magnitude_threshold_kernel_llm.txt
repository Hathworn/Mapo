```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for grad_x, grad_y, and grad_z.
// Preload data into registers to minimize redundant memory access within threads.
// Coalesce memory access by organizing and aligning data structures to improve memory read efficiency.
// Minimize conditional branching to prevent warp divergence and enhance performance.
// Utilize loop unrolling techniques if applicable for better instruction-level parallelism.
