```
// Consider using shared memory to store normalization_factor values for better memory access performance
// Make use of coalesced access patterns to ensure optimal memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling for block-wise operations to increase computational efficiency
// Avoid branch instructions within the critical loop to reduce thread divergence
