```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting thread block size
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage if applied
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for specific hardware capabilities
