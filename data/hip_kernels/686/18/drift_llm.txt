```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory bandwidth.
// Align data accesses to coalesced memory patterns for better memory performance.
// Evaluate the use of texture or surface memory to benefit from cached memory accesses.
// Reorder computations to minimize the number of divergent branches within warps.
// Implement loop unrolling pragmas consistently to maximize warp efficiency.
// Investigate the potential of using the __restrict__ keyword to optimize memory access patterns.
// Reduce redundant recalculation of row_st and col_st by computing them before the loop.
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing our variables scoped within the kernel function.
