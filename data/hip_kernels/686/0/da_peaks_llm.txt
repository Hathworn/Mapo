// Consider using shared memory for d_i2 to improve access speed
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for d_i1 to reduce global memory transactions
// Implement loop unrolling for the inner loop in the loading process to minimize overhead
// Consider optimizing boundary condition checks to improve warp efficiency
// Reduce conditional logic inside the kernel where possible to minimize branching
