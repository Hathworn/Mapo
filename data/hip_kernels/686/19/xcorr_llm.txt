```
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Unroll inner loops for better instruction level parallelism
// Minimize conditional checks inside nested loops for better performance
// Consider leveraging the constant memory for d_i2 if its size is small
