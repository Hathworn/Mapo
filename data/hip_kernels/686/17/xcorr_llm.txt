```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize branching by simplifying conditionals, e.g., using ternary operators
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like d_i2 for better locality
// Optimize loop by ensuring index calculations are minimized
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses with warp size
// Potential use of atomic operations or parallel reductions for better performance
