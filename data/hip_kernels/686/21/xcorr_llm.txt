```
// Use shared memory to store tiles of d_i1 and d_i2 for faster access
// Apply loop unrolling techniques in the kernel loop to reduce instruction overhead
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from caching
// Coalesce global memory access for improved memory throughput
// Balance block and grid dimensions to optimize occupancy and resource utilization
// Minimize divergent branches inside the critical computation loop
