```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure data is accessed in a pattern that exploits memory coalescing capabilities
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Optimize thread block size to match the hardware warp size to reduce divergence
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
