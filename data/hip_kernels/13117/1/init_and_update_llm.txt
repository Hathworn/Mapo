```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by storing initial values in contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Minimize arithmetic within loop by precomputing constant expressions outside the loop if possible
// Perform loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism
