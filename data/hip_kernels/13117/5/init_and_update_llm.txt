// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for temporary values.
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Ensure memory coalescing by verifying that data access patterns align with the memory hierarchy.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can provide further improvements in the iterative calculations.
