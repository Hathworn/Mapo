```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Implement halo region to support stencil computation without conditionals
// Include boundary checks to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory
// Apply loop unrolling to improve loop execution performance
