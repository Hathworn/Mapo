// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by adjusting thread and block configuration
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations for improved throughput
// Assess the data alignment and use padding if necessary to improve performance
// Investigate asynchronous memory operations to hide memory latency
// Profile the memory access patterns to identify bottlenecks
