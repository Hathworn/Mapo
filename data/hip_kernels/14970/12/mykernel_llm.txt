```cpp
// Avoid using printf in device code for better performance
// Consider using shared memory for data frequently accessed by threads
// Minimize global memory access to reduce latency
// Coalesce global memory access for better throughput
// Use vectorized loads/stores where possible to improve memory access efficiency
```
