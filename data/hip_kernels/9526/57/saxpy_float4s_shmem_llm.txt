```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Utilize float4 loads and stores to maximize data throughput
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring proper indexing
// Apply __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block to maintain data consistency
