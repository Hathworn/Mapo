// Consider using float4 operations to optimize memory access
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce shared memory access
// Use double buffering to hide memory latencies
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory arrays
// Unroll loops to reduce loop control overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing usage per thread
