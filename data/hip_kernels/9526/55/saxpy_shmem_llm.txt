```
// Consider increasing the thread block size to better utilize GPU resources.
// Use __ldg() to load global memory as read-only cache loading for x[idx] and y[idx].
// Align shared memory allocations to a multiple of warp size for optimized memory access.
// Unroll the loop to reduce loop control overhead and increase throughput.
