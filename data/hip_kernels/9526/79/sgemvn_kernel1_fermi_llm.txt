```
// Ensure the computation index is within valid range before accessing memory to avoid unnecessary checks.
// Use pointer arithmetic to access elements instead of using indices for better cache locality.
// Unroll inner loop to allow the compiler to optimize loop operations and reduce loop overhead.
// Perform accumulative operations in registers to minimize global memory access.
// Increment A by lda inside the unrolled loop for efficient memory traversal.
// Write results to global memory only when computation is complete and within the valid index to avoid partial writes.
