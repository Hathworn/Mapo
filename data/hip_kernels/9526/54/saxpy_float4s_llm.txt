```
// Avoid uncoalesced memory accesses by ensuring aligned float4 loads and stores
// Exploit data parallelism through vectorized float4 operations to reduce instruction count
// Preload data into registers to minimize access latency during loop iterations
// Use shared memory for potential reuse of common data if applicable to further optimize bandwidth
