```
// Optimize access pattern using float4 shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure shared memory is ready
// Coalesced memory access for reading from global memory
// Ensure all threads have loaded their data with __syncthreads()
// Perform SAXPY operation using vectorized computation
// Coalesced memory write to global memory
