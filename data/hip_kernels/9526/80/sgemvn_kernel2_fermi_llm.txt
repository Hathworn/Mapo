```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for A and x
// Consider increasing the unroll factor in the loop for better efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() carefully to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Prefetch data to shared memory earlier to hide latency
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Check if the number of threads per block (num_threads) is optimal for the GPU
