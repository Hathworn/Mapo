// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to improve memory access patterns
// Optimize memory access by using coalesced accesses where possible
// Reduce shared memory usage by considering alternative memory spaces
// Ensure data alignment to improve access efficiency
// Use loop unrolling entirely for critical sections to reduce instruction overhead
