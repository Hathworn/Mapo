```
// Ensure aligned memory accesses for better performance
// Avoid branching in performance-critical loops
// Group memory accesses to minimize memory transactions
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved throughput
// Ensure data structures are aligned to avoid unaligned accesses
