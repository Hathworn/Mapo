```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement loop unrolling to decrease the overall number of instructions
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for better coalescing efficiency
// Check for potential bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Use asynchronous memory prefetch to hide memory latency
