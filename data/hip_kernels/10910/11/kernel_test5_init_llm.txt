```
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced for better memory throughput
// Align data in memory to facilitate coalesced memory access
// Utilize threadIdx.x for more effective parallel computation
// Minimize redundant computations by only allowing thread 0 to update p1
// Synchronize threads after updating shared data to ensure data consistency
