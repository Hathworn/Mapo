```
// Use shared memory for data common to multiple threads to reduce global memory access.
// Try coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing conditional checks efficiently.
// Ensure the memory allocation size is a multiple of warp size for better memory alignment.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if aliasing is not expected to enable compiler optimizations.
