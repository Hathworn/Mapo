```
// Consider coalesced access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Unroll the loop to decrease loop overhead and increase parallelism
// Allocate shared memory if data reusability across threads is possible
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
