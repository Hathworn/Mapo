```
// Use shared memory to reduce atomic operations on global memory
// Ensure optimal block size to fully utilize shared memory
// Load data into shared memory coalesced to improve bandwidth
// Reduce the number of synchronizations by loop unrolling if possible
// Avoid branching by ensuring uniform control flow
