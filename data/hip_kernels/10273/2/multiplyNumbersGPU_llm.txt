```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for pDataA, pDataB, and pResult
// Minimize arithmetic operations by combining multiplication and division
// Consider using shared memory if reuse of data between threads is possible
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency
// Optimize usage of transcendentals like sqrt() and sin() by precomputing if possible
// Avoid redundant memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers
// Ensure grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy and are multiples of warp size
