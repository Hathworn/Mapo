```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory pressure
// Synchronize threads when using shared memory to ensure data integrity
// Try to unroll loops to increase instruction throughput
// Ensure that memory accesses are correctly aligned to improve access speed
