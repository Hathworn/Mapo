// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible  
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning src and dst memory accesses  
// Increase loop unrolling factor to further leverage instruction-level parallelism  
// Consider using warp-level primitives for fine-grained access if stride is small  
// Balance the grid size and block size to maximize GPU occupancy
