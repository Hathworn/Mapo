```cpp
// Load data into registers to minimize global memory access
// Use shared memory to store partial reductions
// Perform warp reduction to decrease synchronization overhead
// Synchronize threads after reduction to ensure data consistency
// Use first warp for final reduction to minimize synchronization
// Minimize load/store to global memory by using registers and shared memory
```
