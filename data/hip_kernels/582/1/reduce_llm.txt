```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for d_in to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by choosing the right block size for the kernel.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Use __syncthreads() sparingly to avoid serialization and reduce synchronization overhead.
// Analyze the shared memory bank conflicts and align data accesses to minimize them.
// Implement loop unrolling in the reduction loop to optimize performance.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler with optimization.
// Explore reducing the number of shared memory barriers for performance gains.
