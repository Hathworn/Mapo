```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory reads by ensuring d_in accesses are contiguous.
// Ensure that d_out writes are contiguous to improve memory coalescing.
// Minimize divergent branches by checking conditions that affect larger warps.
// Preload repeated values, like lumRange and numBins, to local variables.
