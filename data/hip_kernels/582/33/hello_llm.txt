```
// Store frequently accessed variables in registers to reduce memory access time
// Minimize the use of global memory by using shared memory if possible
// Coalesce global memory accesses to maximize memory throughput
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads in a block for consistent memory access
// Unroll loops to increase throughput by reducing loop overhead
// Use warp shuffle functions to efficiently share data between threads in a warp
```
