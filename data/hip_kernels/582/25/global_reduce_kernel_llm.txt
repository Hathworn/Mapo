```
// Use memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reduction to avoid explicit synchronization.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed available memory per block.
// Minimize register usage by reusing variables and avoiding unnecessary computations.
