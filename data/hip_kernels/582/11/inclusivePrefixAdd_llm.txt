// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory access pattern
// Perform in-block synchronization using __syncthreads() to ensure data consistency during scan
// Use shared memory for Hillis-Steele scan to minimize global memory access latency
// Synchronize threads to ensure previous step's data availability before writing new values
// Manage carry-over between blocks by using values computed in previous blocks
// Reduce redundant syncs by evaluating necessity and removing any unnecessary __syncthreads()
