// Consider using shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Preload data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize performance
// Consider unrolling inner loops to reduce loop overhead
// Use barriers to synchronize threads efficiently during swaps
