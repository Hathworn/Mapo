```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal and fits within device limitations
// Evaluate potential benefits from using more blocks rather than maximizing threads per block
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by offsetting the shared memory indices
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() calls to improve performance
// Use warp-synchronous programming if applicable to avoid synchronization overhead
