// Use shared memory for reductions to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure adequate shared memory allocation for both numerator and denominator arrays
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads for reliable shared memory usage
// Reduce redundant recalculations by storing values in registers where possible
// Implement a warp-wise reduction if the block size is multiple of warp size
