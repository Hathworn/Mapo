```
// Consider minimizing memory divergence by ensuring threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory to hold intermediate values for coalesced access, if applicable.
// Unroll the loops for better occupancy and reduced loop control overhead.
// Align data structures to cache line sizes for more efficient memory transactions.
// Prefetch gradOutput_data using __ldg() for read-only cache access where applicable.
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to optimize memory access patterns.
// Ensure that __device__ functions are inlined with __forceinline__ to reduce function call overhead.
