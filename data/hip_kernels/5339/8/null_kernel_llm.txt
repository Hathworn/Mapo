```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure thread workloads are balanced for maximum occupancy.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by adjusting data placement.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer parameters if applicable.
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// If applicable, use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase parallel execution.
