```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory access is coalesced to improve performance
// Avoid bank conflicts by optimally mapping data in shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and prevent data hazards
// Optimize loop to leverage data locality and reduce redundant calculations
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and throughput
