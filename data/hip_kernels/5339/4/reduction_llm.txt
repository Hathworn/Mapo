```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize global memory access by utilizing shared memory effectively
// Ensure __syncthreads() is called after each stage of reduction to synchronize threads
// Consider unrolling the reduction loop for the final iterations to decrease overhead
// Optimize the block size (TPB) based on the specific GPU architecture
