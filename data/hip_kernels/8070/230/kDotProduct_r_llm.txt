// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use appropriate block size (DP_BLOCKSIZE) that fits within the shared memory and warp size constraints.
// Ensure that 'eidx' calculations minimize divergence and maximize occupancy.
// Consider using atomic operations if precision is not critical and race conditions can be managed.
// Check shared memory bank conflicts to optimize shared memory usage.
