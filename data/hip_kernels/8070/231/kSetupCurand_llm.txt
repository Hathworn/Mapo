```cpp
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by keeping the thread index calculation simple.
// Use shared memory if possible to store intermediate values and reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Consider using texture or constant memory for data that is read-only to optimize cache usage.
// Align memory allocations to 128 bytes for better memory transaction efficiency on AMD GPUs.
// If possible, use warp shuffle functions for data sharing among threads in the same warp.
