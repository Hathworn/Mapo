```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed src data.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads from global memory.
// Utilize texture or surface memory for improved spatial caching in frequent read scenarios.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to potentially reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure that src and tgt pointers are properly aligned for more efficient memory access.
