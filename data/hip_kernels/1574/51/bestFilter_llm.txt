// Optimize memory access patterns to leverage coalesced access for the arrays
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Use texture memory for read-only data with multiple accesses to improve caching
// Reduce branching by minimizing condition checks within loops
// Explore loop unrolling for loops with fixed iteration counts to enhance performance
