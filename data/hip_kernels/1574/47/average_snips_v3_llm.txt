```
// Use shared memory to load frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for uproj loading into shared memory.
// Consider increasing the shared memory size if Nfeatures is small for better utilization.
// Ensure alignment when accessing shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
// Reduce __syncthreads() usage if possible to minimize synchronization overhead.
