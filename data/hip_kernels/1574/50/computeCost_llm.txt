```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads and writes.
// Use vectorized data types for memory-bound operations to enhance throughput.
// Apply loop unrolling for the innermost loop if appropriate.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized within conditional statements.
