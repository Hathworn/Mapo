```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize data access and reduce redundant global memory reads.
// Coalesce memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization between global and local memory.
// Reduce divergent branches, ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths.
// Optimize memory access by comparing blockIdx.x and id[ind] before fetching data from global memory.
