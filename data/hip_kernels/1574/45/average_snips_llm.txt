```
// Cache parameters in local variables for constant memory access to improve latency
// Use local variables for thread and block indices to minimize register usage
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve bandwidth utilization
// Preload data into shared memory for coalesced access and maximize throughput
// Ensure all threads have loaded the data with __syncthreads() for shared memory consistency
// Use atomicAdd to prevent collisions and ensure correct accumulation
