// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory transactions.
// Implement warp-level reductions for improved parallelism and reduced synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate usage of atomic operations on shared memory to avoid excessive serialization.
