```c
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to enhance compiler optimizations.
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for `cmax` and `iW` for better performance.
// Minimize divergent branches inside loops to avoid thread divergence.
// Evaluate using inline functions or macros for repetitive operations to reduce instruction count.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to decrease loop overhead.
