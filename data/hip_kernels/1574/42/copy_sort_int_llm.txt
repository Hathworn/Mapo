```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to store a portion of the data to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling if possible to enhance instruction throughput
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp execution efficiency
```
