// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Precompute values outside loops to save computation time during execution
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently used variables 
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming to optimize loop execution within warps 
// Leverage vectorized operations if applicable to improve data throughput 
// Utilize loop unrolling techniques where feasible to enhance performance
