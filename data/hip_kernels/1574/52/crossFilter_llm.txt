```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesced access for better memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory
// Separate loops for different cases to maximize parallel execution
```
