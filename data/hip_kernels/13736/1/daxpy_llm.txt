// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data properly
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access if appropriate
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Optimize memory throughput by adjusting block and grid size
// Use asynchronous memory operations to overlap computation and data transfer
