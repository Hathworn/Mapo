```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant access to global memory.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider using constant memory if Size and Spacing arrays remain unchanged and are small enough.
// Reduce printf usage or remove it in performance critical sections due to its overhead.
