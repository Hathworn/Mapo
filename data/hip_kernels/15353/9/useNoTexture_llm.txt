```
// Optimize memory access by leveraging shared memory to minimize global memory transactions
// Ensure correct indexing into shared memory for coalesced access patterns
// Synchronize shared memory use with __syncthreads() to prevent data hazards
// Reduce the use of expensive mathematical computations by considering alternative approximations if applicable
// Consider loop unrolling and other computational optimizations within the kernel
// Evaluate the need to reduce the number of calls to expensive sqrtf and powf functions
