// Ensure coalesced memory access to global memory when reading fineAggregateSort array.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider using warp shuffle techniques to reduce __syncthreads() calls.
// Minimize branch divergence by arranging threads handling similar conditions.
// Ensure correct usage and size configuration of shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
