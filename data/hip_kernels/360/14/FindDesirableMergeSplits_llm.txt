```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for adjIndices and adjacency to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Implement shared memory caching for partSizes to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure merging array is accessed in a coalesced manner to improve performance.
// Consider using warp shuffling or parallel reduction for calculating the most desirable neighbor more efficiently.
