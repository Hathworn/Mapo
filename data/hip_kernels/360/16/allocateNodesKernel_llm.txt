```
// Consider optimizing global memory accesses by using coalesced memory access patterns.
// Consider increasing shared memory usage to handle more candidates if necessary.
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized, possibly by redesigning data structures or logic.
// Investigate if reducing syncthreads calls could lead to better performance.
// Evaluate if the shared memory size could be made dynamic based on input size for flexibility.
// Analyze if using warp-level primitives could reduce synchronization overhead.
// Explore if loop unrolling techniques could be applied for the candidate processing loop.
