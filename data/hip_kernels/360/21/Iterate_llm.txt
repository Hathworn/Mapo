```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed global data like adjIndexes to reduce global memory latency
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses when reading adjacency and bestSeenIn to improve throughput
// Implement loop unrolling in the loop iterating from start to end for better performance
// Ensure global memory writes (bestSeenOut, originOut) are coalesced to minimize write latency
// Evaluate the possibility of data locality optimizations within the loop structure
// Check if adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations for optimal memory performance
