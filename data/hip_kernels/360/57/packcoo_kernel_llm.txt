```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Explore coalescing accesses to the global memory for row_indices and column_indices
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring consistent control flow within warp
// Consider memory alignment for better performance, particularly for row_indices updates
// Investigate use of __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve compiler optimizations
