// Consider using shared memory to cache array elements for faster access
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures and access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel for efficiency
// Evaluate block and grid size settings for optimal performance
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to prevent race conditions
