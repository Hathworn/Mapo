```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses in adjIndexes during initialization
// Prefetch adjacency data into registers for reduced global memory accesses
// Optimize candidate search loop by avoiding repeated candidate assignments
// Use atomic operations or intra-warp reduction for counting candidates
// Increase the size of shared memory if blockDim.x allows for better computation distribution
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by optimizing initialization logic
// Ensure partOut[idx] writes are coalesced for improved global memory performance
