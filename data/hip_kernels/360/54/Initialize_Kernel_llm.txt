// Use shared memory to store randoms if memory access is frequent and improves coalescing
// Consider using atomic operations for bestSeen updates to avoid race conditions
// Pre-fetch data into registers where possible to minimize memory latency
// Perform loop unrolling for index computation if multiple iterations are required
