```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency
// Utilize shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data within the block
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction throughput
// Use a memory access pattern that minimizes bank conflicts
// Consider adjusting block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy and performance
