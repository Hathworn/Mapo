// Use shared memory for candidates and candidateCounts to improve access time
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when reading adjacency and adjIndexes arrays
// Use atomic operations to minimize contention and improve performance in shared memory
// Evaluate loop unrolling for neighbor iteration to reduce overhead
// Ensure memory alignment for accessed structures to maximize throughput
// Explore caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
