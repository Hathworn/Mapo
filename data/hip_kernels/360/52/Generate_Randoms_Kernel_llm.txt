```cpp
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve memory coalescing
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access when possible
// Unroll loop to reduce overhead and increase performance
// Minimize use of atomic operations to reduce contention
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for better throughput
// Avoid divergent branches within the warp to maintain performance
