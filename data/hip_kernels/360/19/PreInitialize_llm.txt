```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring coalesced access to global memory.
// Use warp-level primitives where applicable to further optimize parallel processing.
// Ensure that the loop stride is maintained to cover the entire data set efficiently.
// Ensure that the size of grid and block is optimized for the hardware being used.
