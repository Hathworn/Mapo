```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access coalescing
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed per-block limits
// Check if reducing `__syncthreads()` usage can improve performance
// Consider optimal block size for maximizing occupancy
// Maintain memory access patterns to achieve coalesced reads
