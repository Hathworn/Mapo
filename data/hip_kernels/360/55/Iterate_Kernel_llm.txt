```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning accesses to 'adjacency' array.
// Minimize warp divergence by reducing conditional branches within the loop.
// Use shared memory to store 'adjacency' data temporarily if beneficial to reduce global memory access.
// Prefetch 'neighbor' data outside the loop if possible for efficient memory usage.
