```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant access to global memory for removeStencil and subtractions
// Investigate if loop unrolling could increase performance by reducing instruction overhead
// Ensure that partition array is aligned for optimal memory access patterns
