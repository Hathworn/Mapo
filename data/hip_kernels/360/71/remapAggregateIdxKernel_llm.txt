```
// Consider coalesced memory access for fineAggregateSort for better memory throughput
// Ensure fineAggregateSort and aggregateRemapId are stored in global memory efficiently
// Explore using shared memory if beneficial to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Check if loop unrolling offers any performance advantage
// Prefetch data if it helps to hide memory latency
// Align memory access patterns to ensure maximum performance on current architecture
// Investigate if reducing the number of divergent branches would improve performance
