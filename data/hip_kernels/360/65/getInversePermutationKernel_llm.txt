```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking arrangement of data in memory.
// Consider using shared memory for smaller working sets to minimize global memory latency.
// Check for memory bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Profile the kernel to identify any bottlenecks related to memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate if using texture memory can provide benefits for data access patterns.
