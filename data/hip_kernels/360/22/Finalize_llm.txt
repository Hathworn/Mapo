// Consider using shared memory to store adjIndexes and adjacency for better memory access patterns.
// Coalesced memory access can be improved for originIn and bestSeenIn arrays.
// Evaluate the possibility of using warp-level primitives for reductions on neighbor loops.
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning accesses within shared memory if implemented.
