```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to partition, swap_to, swap_from, and swap_index arrays.
// Ensure accesses to nodeWeights and desirability arrays are coalesced for better memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to cache frequent accesses to partSizes to reduce global memory transactions.
// Consider loop unrolling for large arrays to minimize overhead and improve throughput.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations if applicable.
