```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced accesses when loading data into shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data
// Use atomic operations to update partIndices safely
// Consider optimizing the condition and accessing array[idx + 1] only when necessary
// Minimize the number of atomic operations by checking conditions first
