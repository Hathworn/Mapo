// Consider reducing shared memory usage or utilizing more shared memory banks to prevent bank conflicts.
// Investigate the pattern of memory access to global memory for optimizing coalesced memory accesses.
// Reuse already loaded data in registers to minimize reads from global memory.
// Avoid divergent branching within warp to enhance performance.
// Optimize atomic operations by minimizing their usage or implementing atomic-free alternatives.
// Examine the potential for loop unrolling to improve parallel execution.
