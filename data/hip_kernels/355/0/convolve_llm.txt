```
// Consider using a texture memory to cache the source image data for faster access.
// Ensure shared memory is optimally utilized by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Aligning shared memory accesses can help improve memory coalescence.
// Try to reduce conditional statements inside the kernel for better warp execution efficieny.
// Double-check shared memory allocation size to avoid out-of-bound errors.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the convolution computations to potentially improve performance.
// Validate that all memory transactions are coalesced to ensure optimal bandwidth utilization.
// Employ optimized launch configurations, such as using warp size multiples for block dimensions.
