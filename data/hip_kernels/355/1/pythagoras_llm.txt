```
// Use shared memory to cache input data for coalesced access and reduced global memory transactions.
// Optimize block size to match the GPU's warp size for maximum occupancy and alignment with memory transactions.
// Minimize data type conversion by loading input as float directly if possible to avoid overhead.
// Ensure memory access patterns enable coalesced reads from global memory for both input arrays a and b.
// Consider utilizing loop unrolling if input size allows for reduced loop overhead.
// Evaluate using asynchronous memory prefetching or overlapping computation with data transfer for better performance.
