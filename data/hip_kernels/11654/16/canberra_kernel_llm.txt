// Use grid-stride loop for better performance by reducing thread divergence
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Use a single variable for accumulation to reduce register pressure
// Optimize using warp reduction to speed up the accumulation process
// Check for non-zero denominator to prevent division by zero errors
