```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data properly
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Consider using shared memory if accessing data with spatial locality
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization by ensuring independent thread operations
// Use proper memory access patterns to increase cache hit rates
