```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous data access by threads
// Use shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring conditional statements align with warp execution
```
