```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory loads and improve data reuse
// Pre-compute memory indices outside loops to reduce arithmetic overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage for better occupancy and efficiency
// Implement better loop unrolling strategies to minimize control overhead
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to improve performance
// Balance the grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and efficient use of GPU resources
