```
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure that data layout optimizes coalesced memory accesses to improve performance.
// Use appropriate block and grid size to maximize GPU occupancy and efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to optimize execution.
