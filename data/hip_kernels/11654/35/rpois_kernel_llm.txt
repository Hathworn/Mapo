```c
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared or global memory access
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data
// Ensure sufficient occupancy for better resource utilization
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data
