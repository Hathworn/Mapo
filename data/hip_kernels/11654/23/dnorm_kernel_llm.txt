```
// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring vals and out are accessed in a contiguous manner
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results like 'std' and 'e' to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loops if possible to improve instruction throughput
// Increase occupancy by adjusting blockDim.x to better utilize available GPU resources
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing their usage within the kernel
