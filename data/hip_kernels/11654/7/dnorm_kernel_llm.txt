// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize warp-level primitives for efficient reduction operations if needed
// Optimize math functions by possibly using intrinsic functions for faster computation
// Assess need for precision and consider single-precision where applicable to enhance performance
