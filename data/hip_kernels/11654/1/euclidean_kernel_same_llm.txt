```
// Optimize by utilizing shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Reduce synchronization overhead by minimizing __syncthreads usage
// Use warp-level primitives to enhance data reduction efficiency
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce iteration overhead
