```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Accumulate sum in register for faster computation
// Allocate shared memory dynamically based on block size
// Utilize parallel reduction to optimize summation operation
// Reduce global memory writes by coordinating threads to write once per block
```
