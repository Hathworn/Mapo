```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access.
// Explore using __restrict__ to aid the compiler in optimizations.
// Check if loop unrolling could benefit the kernel's performance.
// Use appropriate precision settings if applicable.
// Evaluate if branching can be minimized or eliminated.
