```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for the vals array to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing code for conditionals
// Take advantage of register usage by storing intermediate values in registers
// Use loop unrolling for the generation loop to decrease loop overhead
