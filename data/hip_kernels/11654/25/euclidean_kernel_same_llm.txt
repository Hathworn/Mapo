// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for vg_a to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory more efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts during the binary reduction.
// Ensure proper alignment and padding in shared memory to prevent uncoalesced access patterns.
// Optimize global memory writes by ensuring output is written by the thread with zero offset in warp.
