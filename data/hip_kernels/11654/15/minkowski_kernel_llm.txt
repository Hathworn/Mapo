```
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for input arrays vg_a and vg_b
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by loading only necessary elements
// Minimize usage of global memory by storing intermediate results in shared memory
// Optimize the loop for computing partial sums by balancing workload among threads
// Apply warp reduction techniques to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use faster intrinsic functions like __powf() for power calculations efficiently
// Ensure memory coalescing when writing results back to d array
