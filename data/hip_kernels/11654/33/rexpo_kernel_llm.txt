```
// Consider using shared memory to store repeated reads of lambda
// Coalesce global memory access for the array 'vals' to improve performance
// Pre-calculate -log(hiprand_uniform(&state[idx])) only once if the operation is the same for other computations
// Check if using memory coalescing techniques can help with accessing hiprandState array
// Evaluate if reducing divergent branches will optimize performance further
