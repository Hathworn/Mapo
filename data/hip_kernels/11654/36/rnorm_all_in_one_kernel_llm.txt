```cpp
// Use shared memory to store intermediate values if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to improve occupancy and memory coalescing.
// Consider using float4 or other vectorized types to load/store multiple values in one instruction.
// Ensure all reads and writes are coalesced in memory by aligning data properly.
// Minimize the use of thread-level synchronization by ensuring each thread works independently.
// Prefetch data to avoid stalling on cache misses where applicable.
