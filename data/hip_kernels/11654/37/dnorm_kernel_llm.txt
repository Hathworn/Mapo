```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables like mu and sigma to reduce global memory access
// Minimize the use of expensive mathematical functions; consider precomputing constants like sqrt(2*pi)
// Ensure memory coalescing by checking vals array access pattern aligns with warp execution
// Consider using __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions if shared memory is utilized
