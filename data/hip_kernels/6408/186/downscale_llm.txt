// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning memory reads for gradOutput_data
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Try reducing the number of arithmetic calculations in translate_idx_inv by precomputing common expressions
// Explore launching the kernel with a block size that maximizes GPU occupancy
