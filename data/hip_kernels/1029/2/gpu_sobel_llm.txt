```
// Consider using float4 for coalesced memory accesses.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Ensure proper synchronization after loading data into shared memory.
// Use half-warp for loading data into shared memory to improve coalescing.
// Align shared memory access with warp size to maximize throughput.
// Exploit more SMEM re-use by overlapping load and compute operations.
// Optimize thread block configurations for occupancy and memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory loading patterns avoid strided access.
