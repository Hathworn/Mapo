```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency
// Use coalesced memory access for the input arrays
// Apply loop unrolling for the inner loop operations
// Avoid thread divergence in while conditions
// Use atomic operations or warp-level primitives for parallel reductions
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal warp utilization
