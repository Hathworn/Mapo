```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses with warp size
// Experiment with block and grid size to achieve better occupancy
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to enable compiler optimizations if possible
// Profile kernel to identify other potential memory bottlenecks
```
