// Cache w[i] to reduce global memory access
// Calculate stride outside the loop to optimize loop execution
// Consider using shared memory for further optimization if access patterns allow
// Optimize thread block size for best GPU occupancy and performance
// Align w and dw arrays for coalesced memory access
