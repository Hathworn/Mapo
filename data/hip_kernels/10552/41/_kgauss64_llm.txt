// Consider using shared memory to store xval and sval to reduce global memory access latency.
// Implement loop unrolling for additional memory access patterns inside the loop.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns for xval and sval arrays.
// Investigate potential benefit of using texture memory for read-only data like xval and sval.
