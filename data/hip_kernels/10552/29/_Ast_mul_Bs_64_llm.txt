```
// Ensure coalesced access to xval, xrow, and xcol to improve memory read efficiency.
// Consider padding data structures to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Implement shared memory buffering to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling for the innermost loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Optimize usage of registers by minimizing register dependency between threads.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to optimize reduction operations.
