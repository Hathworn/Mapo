```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to reduce pointer aliasing and improve performance
// Align data to warp size for coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Optimize loop bounds to minimize divergence and improve load balancing across threads
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to maximize memory bandwidth
