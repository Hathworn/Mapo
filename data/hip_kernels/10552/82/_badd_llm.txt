```
// Consider using shared memory for 'b' to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for the 'y' array
// Use loop unrolling if the loop iteration count is known and small
// Ensure optimal occupancy by adjusting block size
// Consider using read-only data cache for 'b' if using shared memory is not suitable
