```cpp
// Ensure data is coalesced for better memory access patterns
// Reduce register usage by minimizing the scope of variables
// Use shared memory if frequent access to the same data is needed by different threads
// Consider occupancy to ensure effective use of all SMs
// Prefetch data if the kernel is memory-bound
```
