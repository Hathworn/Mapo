// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory performance.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Align data accesses to the warp size to avoid bank conflicts and improve memory throughput.
// Reduce the number of mathematical operations in the while loop for faster execution.
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism within the kernel.
