```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure compiler optimizations to utilize fast math functions for sqrt
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform workloads across threads
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to match the hardware architecture for maximum efficiency
