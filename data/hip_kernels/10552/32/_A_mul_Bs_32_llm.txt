```c
// Reduce shared memory usage for better occupancy if variables are shared
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve compiler optimizations
// Prefetch data to avoid memory latency and improve data locality
// Align data to improve coalesced memory access patterns
// Unroll inner loops where vector operations occur for better instruction-level parallelism
// Use constant memory for values that do not change to optimize cache usage
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
```
