```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed elements like x2[xi] and s2[si].
// Use coalesced memory accesses for the array k to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branches in the loop to enhance performance.
// Align data structures to 128-byte boundaries if possible for better memory alignment.
// Ensure that the data type of the indices (xi, si) is appropriate to avoid unnecessary type conversions.
