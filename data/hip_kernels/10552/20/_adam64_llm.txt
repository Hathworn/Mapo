```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for arrays fstm, scndm, and dw
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Ensure memory alignment to improve memory access efficiency
// Minimize divergence by optimizing loop control; consider unrolling the loop
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance based on hardware capabilities
