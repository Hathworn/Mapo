```
// Use shared memory to store x2 and s2 to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using float instead of double if precision allows, for faster computation
// Optimize the loop to reduce branching by unrolling
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory access efficiency
// Avoid recalculating constant expressions inside the loop
