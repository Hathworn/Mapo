// Ensure memory coalescing: Confirm that x[i] accesses sequential memory addresses.  
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize hardware utilization.  
// Use shared memory if x[i] is accessed repeatedly to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.  
// Utilize __restrict__ keyword for pointers if no aliasing occurs.  
// Consider using warp-level primitives for further optimizations in memory access patterns.
