```
// Consider using shared memory for xmask to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access for x and xmask
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration
// Utilize __restrict__ keyword for pointers if applicable to help the compiler optimize
