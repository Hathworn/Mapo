```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for k by aligning thread indices
// Use shared memory for temporary storage of x and sval to reduce global memory access
// Optimize loop unrolling to maximize parallel execution and minimize divergence
// Precompute and cache frequently accessed values such as mx * sr to improve performance
// Evaluate reducing the number of calculations within the while loop for efficiency
// Ensure memory alignment to take advantage of optimal memory bandwidth (e.g., 128-byte alignment)
