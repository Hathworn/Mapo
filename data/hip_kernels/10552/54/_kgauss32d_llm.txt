```c
// Suggest using wider memory transactions by aligning data to improve memory bandwidth
// Consider optimizing data access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory access
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by selecting appropriate block size and shared memory usage
// Profile the kernel to identify further bottlenecks that may require additional optimization efforts
```
