```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to avoid unnecessary memory aliasing checks
// Ensure xmask array is properly aligned to leverage coalesced memory access
// Explore shared memory usage for frequently accessed data like xmask for improved latency
// Optimize block and grid size to maximize occupancy and balance memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling further if performance testing indicates benefit
