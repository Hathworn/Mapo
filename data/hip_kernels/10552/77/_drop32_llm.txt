```
// Precompute stride for all threads to reduce redundant calculations
// Utilize ternary operator for conditional assignments to enhance code readability and maintain performance
// Consider using shared memory if xmask and x are frequently accessed by threads within the same block to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data into registers to decrease global memory read latency and increase throughput
