// Consider further optimizing memory accesses by improving coalescing
// Explore use of warp shuffles to reduce shared memory usage
// Balance the number of threads and blocks to fully utilize the GPU
// Investigate if more complex looping constructs can increase efficiency
// Ensure the grid size and block size configuration is optimal for the target GPU
// Evaluate if double buffering shared memory could provide performance benefits
