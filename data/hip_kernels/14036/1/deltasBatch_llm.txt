```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for inputs array to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to cache weights for faster access, reducing global memory traffic
// Consider loop unrolling for the weighted sum calculation loop for performance gain
// Ensure proper memory alignment of inputs and weights to avoid misaligned memory access
// Optimize reduction by using warp shuffle techniques for sum calculation
// Minimize branch divergence in the sum calculation logic
// Explore using double buffering for overlapping computation and memory access
