```
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory for weights
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in critical loops
// Coalesce memory access to improve memory access patterns
// Utilize warp shuffle operations for efficient data sharing within a warp
// Reduce divergent branches within the kernel functions
