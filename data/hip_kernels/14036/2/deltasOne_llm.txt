```cpp
// Consider coalesced access to global memory to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory if possible to store reused values within a block.
// Minimize bank conflicts by padding shared memory arrays appropriately.
// Evaluate the benefit of using asynchronous memory copies for input data.
// Apply loop unrolling optimizations if the loop bounds are fixed and small.
