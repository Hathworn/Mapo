```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate if using shared memory for frequently accessed inputs or weights can reduce global memory traffic
// Investigate if loop unrolling techniques could benefit the innermost loops in terms of performance
// Check if the activation and weight update loops can benefit from warp-level parallelism
// Assess occupancy and ensure sufficient threads per block to keep the GPU fully utilized
