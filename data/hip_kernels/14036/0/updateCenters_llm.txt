```cpp
// Optimize shared memory usage by accounting for bank conflicts
// Ensure alignment of shared memory access to minimize latencies
// Consider using loop unrolling for the innermost loop to improve performance
// Evaluate the usage of half precision if accuracy permits to boost performance
// Consider prefetching data to registers where feasible
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
