```c
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Prefetch data to shared memory if possible to reduce global memory reads
// Minimize divergence by ensuring similar execution paths for threads
// Consider loop unrolling if N is known and manageable
// Analyze the block and grid size choice to maximize occupancy
```
