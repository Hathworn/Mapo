```cpp
// Use shared memory to store parts of array 'x' for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data with warp size
// Consider using __syncthreads() if needed to synchronize threads in a block
// Investigate the use of register memory for frequently accessed variables
```
