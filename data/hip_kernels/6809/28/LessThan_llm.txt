```
// Consider aligning shared memory access to warp size for coalesced access
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed available resources per block
// Optimize shared memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Evaluate thread block size to optimize parallelism and resource usage
// Preload shared memory with more data if possible to reduce global memory access
