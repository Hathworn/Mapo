```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access consecutive memory locations
// Unroll the loop to reduce loop control overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure stride is a multiple of warp size to avoid warp divergence
