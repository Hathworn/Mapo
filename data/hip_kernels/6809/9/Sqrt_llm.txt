```
// Consider using shared memory for x values to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate the need for further unrolling in the loop for increased throughput
// Check for warp divergence in the loop and restructure for minimal divergence
