```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for reused elements to optimize memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns.
// Use the __restrict__ qualifier to potentially reduce memory traffic.
// Tune block and grid size according to the GPU architecture for optimal performance.
// Optimize the condition check using bitwise operations if applicable.
// Ensure data alignment in memory for efficient access.
