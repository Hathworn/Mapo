```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate if shared memory can be utilized to store intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied to the while loop for reducing loop overhead and improving performance.
// Assess occupancy and adjust block size and grid size for better utilization of the GPU resources.
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency and improve throughput.
