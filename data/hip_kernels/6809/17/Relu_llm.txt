```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure the number of threads per block is a multiple of the warp size to maximize efficiency
// Optimize thread-to-memory access pattern to minimize memory latency
