```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory reads
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better throughput
// Prefetch data into registers when possible to reduce global memory latency
// Use warp shuffle operations to avoid redundant memory accesses if applicable
