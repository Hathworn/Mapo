```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access when possible.
// Minimize the use of printf due to its high overhead in GPU kernels.
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive operations within the kernel.
// Optimize kernel launch configuration with regards to occupancy.
// Balance the workload among threads to ensure efficient parallel execution.
// Reduce divergent branches to ensure warp efficiency.
