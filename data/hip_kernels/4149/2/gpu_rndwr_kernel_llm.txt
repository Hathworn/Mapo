```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure velocity is different for each warp to improve caching
// Early exit for threads outside valid range to save computational resources
// Cache data from global to shared memory for improved performance
// Maintain warp convergence to reduce divergence and improve efficiency
```
