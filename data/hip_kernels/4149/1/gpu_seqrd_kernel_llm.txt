```
// Consider tiling the memory access to improve cache efficiency
// Experiment with vectorized loads beyond four elements to further optimize memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory traffic
// Assess if increasing the blockDim.x could improve coalesced memory access
// Investigate using prefetching techniques to further hide memory latency
// Optimize warp execution efficiency by aligning memory access across threads
