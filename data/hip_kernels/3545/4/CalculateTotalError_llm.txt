```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to improve memory access performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring no simultaneous accesses to the same bank.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for the reduction loop to enhance performance.
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions.
// Optimize for different GPU architectures to balance memory bandwidth and compute resources.
