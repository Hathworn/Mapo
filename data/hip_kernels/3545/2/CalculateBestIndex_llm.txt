// Use shared memory to minimize the number of global memory accesses  
// Utilize shared memory to store frequently accessed data  
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when reading from global memory  
// Minimize data transfers by storing intermediate results in shared memory  
// Apply parallel reduction to optimize computation and memory usage  
// Implement __syncthreads() to ensure sync during shared memory operations  
// Write back only necessary results to global memory for reduced bandwidth usage
