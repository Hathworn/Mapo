```
// Utilize shared memory to hold smaller blocks of u and v for faster access.
// Minimize global memory accesses by caching src values in shared memory.
// Apply loop unrolling techniques to enhance parallel processing efficiency.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed small data, such as time_scale.
// Ensure proper memory access patterns to maximize coalesced reads and writes.
