```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access when possible.
// Ensure that warp divergence is minimized by organizing conditional structures.
// Opt for use of __restrict__ qualifiers if aliasing is not a concern.
// Leverage constant memory for read-only data that does not change often.
// Reduce the number of _atomicAdd operations to mitigate performance bottlenecks.
