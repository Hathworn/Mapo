```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for data reused by multiple threads to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure that accesses to global memory are coalesced to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate the effectiveness of loop unrolling if repetitive patterns exist in calculations.
// Profile and optimize the memory access patterns to reduce the number of global memory transactions.
// Minimize thread divergence by reviewing conditional statements and branching code paths.
