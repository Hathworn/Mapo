```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input to improve memory throughput.
// Use texture memory for inputImage if the access pattern benefits from caching.
// Ensure outputImage is aligned to float4 boundaries for efficient memory writes.
// Minimize divergent branches inside kernels for improved warp execution efficiency.
