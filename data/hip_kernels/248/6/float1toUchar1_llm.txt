```
// Use shared memory for block-level data reuse to minimize global memory access
// Consider coalesced access patterns for input and output images for better memory throughput
// Ensure memory access within warps is aligned to avoid bank conflicts
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only input image data
// Opt for using __ldg() intrinsic for read-only memory access when appropriate
// Balance grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
// Avoid branching by refactoring boundary checks using logical operations or compiler directives
