```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory alignment for coalesced access to improve bandwidth.
// Consider using float4 manipulation functions intrinsic to GPU.
// Minimize thread divergence by reorganizing logic.
// Verify if loop unroll can enhance performance if applicable.
