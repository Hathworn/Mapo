// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase reuse.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data structures with warp size when possible.
// Use loop unrolling in the accumulation for potential performance gain if applicable.
// Evaluate whether wider thread blocks would improve occupancy and data access patterns.
// Aim for balance between computational load and memory bandwidth in kernel configuration.
