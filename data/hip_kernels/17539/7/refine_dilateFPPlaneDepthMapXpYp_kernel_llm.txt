```
// Ensure data is coalesced by accessing maskMap and fpPlaneDepthMap in a linear fashion
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize the use of registers by limiting the use of local variables in computationally intensive sections
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for the computation steps to reduce the overhead of loop control instructions
