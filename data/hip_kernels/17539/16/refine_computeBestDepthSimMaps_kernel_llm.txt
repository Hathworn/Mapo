```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache idpts and isims for each block to reduce global memory access.
// Optimizing the branching logic in the kernel could improve warp execution efficiency.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Use constant memory if any data is read-only and frequently accessed by all threads.
