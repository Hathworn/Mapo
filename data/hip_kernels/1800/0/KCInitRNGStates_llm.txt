```
// Consider coalesced access for gSeeds to enhance memory access efficiency.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring gStates are accessed sequentially.
// Pre-fetch data into shared memory if reused to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow similar execution paths.
