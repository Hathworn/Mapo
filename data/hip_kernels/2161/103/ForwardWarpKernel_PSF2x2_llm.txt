// Unroll the loop where possible to improve performance.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads.
// Coalesce memory accesses for better utilization of memory bandwidth.
// Avoid using modff in favor of integer operations to reduce computation overhead.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to improve memory read efficiency.
