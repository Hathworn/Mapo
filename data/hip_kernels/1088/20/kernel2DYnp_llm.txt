```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Move weight data into shared memory once per block to minimize memory traffic.
// Use thread synchronization to ensure data consistency in shared memory.
// Unroll loops to improve instruction level parallelism.
// Avoid repeated calculations by hoisting invariant expressions outside loops.
// Ensure non-coalesced memory access patterns are minimized.
