// Increase memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for repeated calculations
// Consider loop unrolling for arithmetic operations if applicable
// Check if vectorization is possible to improve throughput
// Minimize divergence by ensuring aligned grid and block sizes
// Prefetch or cache data that is accessed multiple times
