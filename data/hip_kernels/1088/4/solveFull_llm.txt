```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for data
// Group threads doing similar work to ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Preload more data into registers where beneficial to minimize global memory latency
// Analyze the potential for loop unrolling if computational pattern permits
