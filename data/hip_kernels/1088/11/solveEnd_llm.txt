```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Use loop unrolling if there are any loops in future extensions of the kernel
// Evaluate the potential benefit of using texture memory for constant access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
// Ensure the occupancy is maximized by choosing an appropriate block size
