```
// Use shared memory to cache weights for faster access and reduce global memory reads.
// Minimize the memory transactions by utilizing shared memory for storing dataInput within boundaries.
// Employ __syncthreads() to ensure complete loading of data into shared memory before operating on it.
// Unroll loops to improve performance by increasing instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize boundary conditions to reduce conditional branching and ensure coalesced memory access.
// Ensure efficient thread access patterns to maximize memory throughput and reduce latency.
// Consider aligning shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts and improve performance.
