```cpp
// Ensure proper memory coalescing by aligning shared memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant loads from global memory.
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize the stencil computation further.
// Check boundary conditions carefully to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.
// Use __syncthreads() only where necessary to avoid thread divergence.
