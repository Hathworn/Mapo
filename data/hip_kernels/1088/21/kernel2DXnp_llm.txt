```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve data locality.
// Unroll loops where beneficial to increase instruction throughput.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory access patterns are aligned.
// Load data into shared memory with boundary checks to avoid conditional statements in critical code sections.
// Utilize `__syncthreads()` after loading data into shared memory to synchronize threads.
// Optimize the use of registers by avoiding unnecessary variable declarations inside loops.
