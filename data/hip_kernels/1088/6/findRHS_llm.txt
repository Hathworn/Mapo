```cpp
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed variables
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring continuous threads access continuous memory
// Consider using register memory for variables that are heavily reused within the kernel
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve performance
```
