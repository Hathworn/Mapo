// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data structures for better performance.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize the number of conditional checks within the kernel for better execution efficiency.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the GPU architecture being used.
