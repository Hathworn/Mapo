```
// Use shared memory to cache data input for faster access
// Move weights to shared memory for reduced global memory accesses
// Implement unrolling to eliminate loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism
// Use auto lambda to reduce redundant code and enhance readability
// Synchronize threads after loading data to ensure shared memory consistency
// Combine computation and synchronization strategically to maximize resource utilization
// Ensure global memory writes occur after all computations are finalized
