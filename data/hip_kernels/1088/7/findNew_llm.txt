```
// Consider using shared memory to cache cBar and cHalf values to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses in cCurr, cBar, and cHalf.
// Investigate the use of vectorized types like double2 for potential memory throughput improvements.
// Profile memory access patterns to ensure no uncoalesced or divergent accesses occur.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and memory bandwidth.
