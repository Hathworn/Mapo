```
// Use shared memory to cache a and b for faster repeated access
// Reduce modulus operations by unrolling loops or accessing linearly within bounds
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for a and b
// Optimize floating-point division by using fast division or multiplying by reciprocal if precision allows
