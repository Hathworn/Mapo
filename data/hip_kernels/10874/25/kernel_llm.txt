```
// Use a shared memory buffer for intermediate calculations if possible to minimize global memory access.
// Consider using texture or surface memory for read-only data to leverage caching benefits.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses with warp boundaries.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring memory access patterns are optimal.
// Use asynchronous memory copies where applicable to overlap data transfer and computation.
