```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance.
// Optimize thread block size for better utilization of compute units.
// Perform loop unrolling if this function is part of a larger loop.
