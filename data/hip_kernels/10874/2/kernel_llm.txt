```
// Use shared memory to cache a subset of `a` and `b` to reduce global memory access
// Prefer coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Consider adjusting block size to optimize memory bandwidth and ensure full occupancy
// Apply loop unrolling if the compiler does not automatically optimize repetitive operations
// Evaluate the use of `__restrict__` qualifiers on pointers to aid compiler optimizations
