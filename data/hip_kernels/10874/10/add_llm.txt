```c
// Consider using atomics to avoid race conditions
// Utilize shared memory for data that is reused across threads
// Minimize global memory accesses by caching data in shared memory
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy and throughput
// Ensure proper memory coalescing to improve memory bandwidth utilization
```
