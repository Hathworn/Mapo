```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Optimize shared memory initialization by using a loop instead of individual initialization.
// Consider unrolling the loop to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Utilize warp-level primitives to further optimize atomic operations.
// Ensure proper alignment of data to prevent memory access inefficiencies.
// Evaluate the use of __syncthreads() to minimize its impact on performance.
// Consider increasing block size to maximize parallelism and resource utilization.
