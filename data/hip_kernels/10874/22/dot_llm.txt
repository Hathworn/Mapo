```
// Consider using float4 or float2 to load multiple elements at once for better memory coalescing.
// Ensure the data is properly aligned to improve the memory access pattern.
// Implement loop unrolling in the accumulation loop to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching to hide memory latency.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper access patterns.
