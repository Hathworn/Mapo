// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Utilize memory prefetching for improved data loading efficiency
// Consider employing warp-shuffle operations for better data exchange
// Optimize block and grid size to match GPU architecture for maximal occupancy
