```
// Optimize memory coalescence by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider aligning data structures to improve global memory access speed
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize multiprocessor occupancy
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data in registers or shared memory
