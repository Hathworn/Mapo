```
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for d_out to improve compiler optimization.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy and reduce warp divergence.
// Consider using constexpr for any constants to allow compile-time optimizations.
// Ensure the kernel is launched with enough threads to keep all GPU multiprocessors busy.
