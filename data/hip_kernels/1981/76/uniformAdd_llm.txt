// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Load uniform values to shared memory using the first thread of each block for efficiency
// Ensure all threads synchronize before accessing the shared memory
// Use single instruction for updating g_data to minimize arithmetic operations
// Conditional check to ensure thread operations do not exceed the array bounds
