```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory if accessing data multiple times within a thread
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing threads to work on contiguous memory
// Optimize data transfer between host and device by using pinned memory
// Use constant memory for data that does not change and will be accessed repeatedly
