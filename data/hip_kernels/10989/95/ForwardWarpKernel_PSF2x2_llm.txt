```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Avoid unnecessary arithmetic operations inside loops to reduce overhead.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to decrease global memory accesses.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads process contiguous data where possible.
// Use __ldg() for reading data that remains constant within each kernel invocation for potential caching benefits.
