// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory access patterns  
// Replace scalar operations with vector operations if applicable  
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access  
// Consider loop unrolling for operations within the kernel  
// Optimize occupancy by adjusting block size according to GPU architecture
