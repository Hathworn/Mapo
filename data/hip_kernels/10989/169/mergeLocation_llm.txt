```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Ensure data alignment for loc_ access to benefit from coalesced memory reads.
// Use float2 for x and y to exploit vectorized memory operations, if applicable.
// Evaluate increasing block size to improve occupancy and throughput on the GPU.
// Minimize branching by ensuring ptidx is processed in consecutive order if possible.
