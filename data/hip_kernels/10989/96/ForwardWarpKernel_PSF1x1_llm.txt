// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for 'u' and 'v' arrays.
// Utilize shared memory to cache 'src' data and minimize global memory accesses.
// Consider tiling approach to maximize shared memory utilization.
// Optimize thread block size and shape to balance occupancy and memory access patterns.
// Investigate warp specialization to enhance efficiency in atomic operations.
