```
// Consider using shared memory for values accessed frequently by multiple threads to reduce global memory access.
// Grouping global memory accesses could lead to coalesced memory access, improving performance.
// Use texture memory (or read-only cache) for read-only data to potentially exploit cache performance.
// Tune the block and grid sizes based on the architecture to maximize occupancy and minimize potential thread divergence.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques if applicable to decrease overhead in iterative operations.
