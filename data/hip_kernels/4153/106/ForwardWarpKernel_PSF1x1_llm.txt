// Consider coalesced memory access for 'u', 'v', 'src', and 'dst'
// Use shared memory to store temporary results within blocks
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring alignment
// Minimize divergent branching by consolidating boundary checks
// Explore using vectorized types for memory reads and writes
