```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access
// Use vectorized memory access where possible to improve memory throughput
// Prefetch data from global to local registers to hide memory latency
// Ensure coalesced accesses for better memory throughput
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding
// Load flow values in registers to minimize access overhead
// Evaluate loop unrolling for performance enhancement
// Minimize usage of atomic operations where feasible
