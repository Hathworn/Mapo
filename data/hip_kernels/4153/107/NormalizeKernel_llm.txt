```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads/writes
// Consider using const restrict qualifiers for pointer arguments to improve memory access efficiency
// Prefetch data to reduce global memory latency
// Minimize divergent branching to improve warp execution efficiency
