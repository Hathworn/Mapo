```
// Improve memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses in nested loop
// Prefetch data for better memory latency masking
// Ensure shared memory size is sufficient and optimize its usage
// Minimize synchronization overhead by restructuring parallel reduction
// Consider using warp-level operations for faster parallel reduce
// Analyze and optimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
