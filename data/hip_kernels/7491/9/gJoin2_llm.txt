// Optimize memory access for better coalescing.
// Consider using shared memory for rowIn1 and rowIn2 to reduce global memory access.
// Investigate if reducing the use of conditional statements inside the loop can improve performance.
// Ensure outStride, inStride1, and inStride2 are correctly aligned for optimal memory access.
