```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory transactions
// Ensure sparseIndices are stored in shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory reads
// Consider double-buffering technique to mask latencies associated with memory transfers
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy, possibly using performance heuristics
