```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced
// Check if data alignment improves memory access patterns
// Use shared memory if there are multiple accesses to the same memory location
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for data exchange between threads
// Experiment with using different block sizes to optimize occupancy and throughput
// Profile and tune the kernel to minimize memory latency and maximize performance
