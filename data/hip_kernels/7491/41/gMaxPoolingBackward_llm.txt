```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of 'in' or 'mask' for repeated use
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'adj' and 'adjIn'
// Ensure aligned memory access to improve cache utilization
// Minimize divergent branching within the loop for 'currentMaxIdx'
// Use loop unrolling strategically to balance instruction overhead and memory latency
```
