```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for adjRow, valRow, and gradRow to improve memory throughput
// Consider using loop unrolling for the first for loop to reduce overhead
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to optimize shared memory usage and synchronization
// Ensure all threads within a block contribute to _sum to maximize efficiency
// Consider occupancy and shared memory usage to optimize grid and block size
```
