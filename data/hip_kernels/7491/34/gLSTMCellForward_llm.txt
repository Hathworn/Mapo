```
// For better memory coalescing, ensure that threads access consecutive memory addresses in global memory.
// Experiment with loop unrolling to enhance performance where applicable.
// Consider using shared memory or registers to cache frequently accessed data like biases, reducing global memory access.
// Evaluate using the __restrict__ keyword to potentially enhance memory access by providing the compiler with more optimization opportunities.
// Verify that using a two-dimensional grid indeed provides better load balancing and distribution for the problem size.
// Review occupancy metrics to adjust block and grid dimensions for optimal thread utilization.
