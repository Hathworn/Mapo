```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for xW, sU, and adj to improve memory throughput
// Optimize the use of registers by using local variables for frequently accessed data within each loop iteration
// Use warp-level synchronization to avoid redundant calculations within the same warp
// Consider using atomic operations only when necessary to avoid synchronization overhead
