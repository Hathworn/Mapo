```c
// Consider using shared memory if rows have spatial locality to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce the loop overhead.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimally set for the target GPU to maximize occupancy.
