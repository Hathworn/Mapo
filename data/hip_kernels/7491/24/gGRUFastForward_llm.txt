```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for out and state arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for xW and sU
// Eliminate redundant loads by storing mask[j] result for reuse
// Unroll loops where possible for better performance
// Assure b array accesses remain within bounds to leverage any potential constant memory benefits
