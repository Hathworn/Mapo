// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data in memory
// Minimize global memory access by loading data into shared memory if possible
// Use vectorized operations to enhance memory throughput
// Optimize loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance
// Ensure atomicAdd usage is necessary as it can be costly
// Profile for potential warp divergence and optimize accordingly
