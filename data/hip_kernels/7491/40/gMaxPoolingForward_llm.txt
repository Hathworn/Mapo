```
// Consider aligning memory accesses for improved coalescing.
// Prefetch input and mask data to shared memory if beneficial.
// Utilize loop unrolling for iterating over mask elements.
// Ensure b and localMask are cache-friendly by optimizing access patterns.
// Minimize branch divergence in if(product > currentMax) condition.
