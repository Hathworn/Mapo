```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use memory coalescing techniques to ensure adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations.
// Investigate using vectorized memory loads/stores if supported by hardware for better memory throughput.
// Evaluate using asynchronous memory copies to hide memory latency during computation.
