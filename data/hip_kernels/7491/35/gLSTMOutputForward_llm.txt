```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for reading input data
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant reads from global memory
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed sizes of 'cols'
// Check if memory access patterns can be improved for xW and sU
// Optimize grid and block dimensions according to the data size
