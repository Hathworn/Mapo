// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data appropriately
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory loads
// Reduce thread divergence by synchronizing behavior across threads within blocks
// Optimize tile size and block dimensions according to the architecture specifications
