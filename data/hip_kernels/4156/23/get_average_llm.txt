```c
// Unroll loops where possible to improve memory access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced access by aligning data structures if possible.
// Minimize atomic operations to reduce contention and improve performance.
// Use asynchronous data transfers if applicable for better overlap of computation and communication.
