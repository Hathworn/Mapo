```
// Use shared memory to reduce the latency of global memory accesses.
// Minimize memory access divergence by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Reduce redundant transformation matrix accesses by storing relevant parts in registers.
// Prioritize memory access patterns that maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure memory accesses within the loop are properly unrolled, if possible.
