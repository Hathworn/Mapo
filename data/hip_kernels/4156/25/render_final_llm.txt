```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes.
// Consider using __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data to improve cache efficiency.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory by properly aligning access patterns.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve parallel efficiency.
// Minimize register usage to allow for higher occupancy in the kernel.
// Remove redundant calculations by precomputing constant values outside the loop.
