```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Optimize shared memory usage, if applicable, to minimize global memory access
// Consider increasing TILE_DIM for better utilization of memory bandwidth
// Use thread block synchronization to ensure atomic operations are complete
// Investigate memory access patterns to reduce cache misses
// Utilize memory bank conflicts to improve throughput
