```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced access by using contiguous threads in x-dimension
// Unroll loops to decrease loop overhead
// Optimize shared memory access by minimizing bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and ensure data consistency
```
