```
// Optimize data access patterns for coalesced reads
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data
// Minimize global memory accesses by leveraging shared memory
// Ensure all threads within a block load data in a coalesced manner
// Use atomic operations efficiently to avoid thread contention
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance in the loop
