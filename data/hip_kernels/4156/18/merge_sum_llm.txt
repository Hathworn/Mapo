```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Reduce warp divergence by handling out-of-bounds threads early
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before shared memory use
// Consider using texture memory for better caching if access patterns are read-only
```
