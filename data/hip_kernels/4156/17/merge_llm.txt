```
// Use shared memory for more efficient access pattern
// Perform coalesced memory access for selection array
// Consider loop unrolling for bottle-necked loops
// Use constant memory for uniform weight variables
// Minimize divergence by using predication where applicable
// Ensure alignment of data structures for optimal access
