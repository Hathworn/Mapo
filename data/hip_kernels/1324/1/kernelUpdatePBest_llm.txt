```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for positions and pBests arrays.
// Minimize shared memory usage by reducing dimensions if possible.
// Minimize synchronization barriers for performance improvement.
// Consider loop unrolling for accessing tempParticle arrays.
// Evaluate fitness_function with warp-synchronous programming for efficiency.
// Consider using `__restrict__` qualifiers for pointers to aid compiler optimization.
// Optimize memory accesses for gBest via coherent shared or constant memory usage.
