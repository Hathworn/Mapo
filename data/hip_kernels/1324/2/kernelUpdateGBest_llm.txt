// Consider coalesced memory access for pBests for improved memory throughput
// Optimize the use of shared memory by minimizing redundant memory loads
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce the need for __syncthreads()
// Balance the workload among threads to ensure maximum occupancy
// Consider loop unrolling for the for-loops to reduce instruction overhead
