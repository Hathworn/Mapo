// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by proper indexing to reduce cache misses
// Evaluate loop unrolling further for the inner loop for performance gain
// Use warp-level primitives for optimizing reduction of maximum values
// Preload repeated values like instanceStart into registers to minimize recalculation
