// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses  
// Align memory accesses to enhance coalescing and increase throughput  
// Minimize divergence within the loop to ensure consistent execution paths  
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve cache utilization  
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations to hide memory latency   
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations for better memory bandwidth utilization  
// Adjust block and grid sizes to match the hardware limits and maximize occupancy
