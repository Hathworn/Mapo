```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data for faster access.
// Ensure data coalescing by accessing memory in a sequential manner.
// Leverage read-only cache for input data to reduce memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergent branching by grouping similar execution paths.
// Optimize thread and block dimensions for better occupancy.
