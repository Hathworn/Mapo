```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Consider using warp-level primitives to minimize branch divergence
// Apply memory coalescing when accessing 'parameters' and 'history' arrays
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency
// Optimize the loop for memory access patterns to improve cache efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring aligned memory access in shared memory
