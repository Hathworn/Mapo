```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant loads from global memory.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead.
// Prefetch data to registers for faster access during computation.
// Consider alignment and coalescing of memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Avoid branching where possible to ensure all threads take the same execution path.
