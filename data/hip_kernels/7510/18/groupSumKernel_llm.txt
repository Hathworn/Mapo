// Optimize memory access by using __ldg intrinsic to load read-only input values for better performance
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by restructuring computations when feasible
// Use a tiling strategy to improve memory coalescing and bandwidth utilization
// Explore the use of loop unrolling techniques to decrease instruction overhead and increase throughput
// Profile the kernel to identify potential warp divergence and optimize control flow
