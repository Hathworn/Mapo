```
// Consider coalesced access to memory for predictions and targets arrays to improve throughput
// Employ shared memory if multiple threads within a block access the same data
// Explore using the __restrict__ keyword to provide compiler hints for pointer aliasing
// Assess the impact of loop unrolling for the for-loop to reduce overhead per iteration
// Evaluate using atomic operations if reduction or accumulation is needed within threads
