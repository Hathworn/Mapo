```
// Combine adjacent memory accesses into a single coalesced access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve cache usage
// Ensure data alignment to take advantage of hardware coalescing features
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Consider unrolling the loop to increase instruction level parallelism
