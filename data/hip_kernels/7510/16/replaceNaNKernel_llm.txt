```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access if shared memory is used
// Explore the use of __ldg() for read-only access of global memory if beneficial
// Consider loop unrolling for the for-loop to increase throughput
// Ensure that global memory accesses are coalesced for efficient memory usage
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory bandwidth if applicable
