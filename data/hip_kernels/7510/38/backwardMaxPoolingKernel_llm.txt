```
// Prefer reading maxIndices and chain values into shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory to ensure consistency
// Avoid unnecessary computations by checking boundary conditions before accessing memory
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to optimize performance
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have reached the same point before proceeding
