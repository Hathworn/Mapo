```
// Consider coalesced accesses for 'parameterIndices' and 'counts' arrays.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data such as 'history'.
// Ensure memory accesses to 'parameters' are coalesced for better performance.
// Improve memory access pattern for 'gradient' to maximize coalescing.
// Explore using vectorized loads/stores for 'parameters' and 'gradient'.
// Prefetch data to shared memory where applicable to hide latency.
// Use 'const __restrict__' pointers to help the compiler with potential optimizations.
// Align data structures to cache line size to reduce cache misses.
