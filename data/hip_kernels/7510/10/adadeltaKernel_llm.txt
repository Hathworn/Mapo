// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like gradientAccumulation and updateAccumulation for each block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by organizing data structures and access logic to minimize non-coalesced access.
// Optimize loop bounds and conditions to minimize unnecessary computations and ensure efficient execution.
