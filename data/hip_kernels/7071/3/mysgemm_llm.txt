```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data locality.
// Align loop trip counts to warp size for better performance on GPU.
// Use vectorized data types for A and B (e.g., float4) to increase throughput.
// Consider prefetching data into registers to hide memory latency.
// Optimize the block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize memory latency.
