```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for arrays A, B, and C
// Ensure all threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations to improve performance
// Align data structures on memory boundaries to optimize memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to decrease global memory traffic
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and branch divergence
// Optimize launch configuration (block size and grid size) to fully utilize GPU resources
