```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize shared memory initialization.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce contention in atomic operations.
// Explore using hierarchical atomics to reduce the stress on global memory bandwidth.
// Use loop unrolling for shared memory initialization to minimize loop control overhead.
// Optimize shared memory bank conflicts during histogram calculation.
