```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for loading A and B tiles
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for A, B, C pointers to enhance compiler optimizations
// Check possibility of loop unrolling for TiElem loop for better performance
// Try using multiple threads within a block to load global memory into shared memory
// Evaluate whether larger or smaller TILE_SZ would give better performance
// Ensure optimal grid and block size configuration for the target hardware
// Explore use of warp-level primitives for synchronization within tile computation
