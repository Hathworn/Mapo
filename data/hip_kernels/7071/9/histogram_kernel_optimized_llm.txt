// Use shared memory for improved memory access efficiency
// Initialize shared memory in parallel to reduce overhead
// Efficient histogram calculation minimizes global memory access
// Avoids repeated atomic operations by using an accumulator
// Transfers data from faster shared memory to global memory only once after calculations
