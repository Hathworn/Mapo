```
// Consider using shared memory for data that is accessed multiple times to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns by aligning data accesses with warp size.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized data types for potential throughput improvements.
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Tune the number of threads per block to fully utilize available multiprocessors.
