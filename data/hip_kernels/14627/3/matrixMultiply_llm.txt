```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Ensure shared memory tiles are fully utilized before synchronization.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by utilizing padding if necessary.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner multiplication loop for optimization.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
