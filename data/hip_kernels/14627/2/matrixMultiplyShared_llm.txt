```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within the loop
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for global memory writes and reads
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring stride-1 access
// Use __syncthreads() to handle synchronization between threads properly
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring all branches are executed by threads in a warp
// Optimize for occupancy by using appropriate block and grid sizes
// Consider vectorization if hardware supports it for better throughput
