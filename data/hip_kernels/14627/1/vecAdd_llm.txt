```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for better coalescence
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring data size is divisible by block size
// Optimize block and grid size for better occupancy and workload distribution
// Experiment with different memory access patterns for improved cache utilization
