```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly
// Consider using shared memory if inputs are accessed multiple times
// Leverage asynchrony with streams for overlapping computation and memory operations
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better hardware utilization
// Minimize memory traffic by reusing data loaded into registers
```
