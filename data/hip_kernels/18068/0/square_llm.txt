```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize boundary check to avoid unnecessary computations
// Consider using shared memory for repeated data access by multiple threads to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Take advantage of vectorized memory operations if hardware supports it
```
