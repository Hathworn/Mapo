// Consider using shared memory if N is used frequently to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that *accuracy is properly aligned to avoid misaligned memory access
// Evaluate whether atomic operation is necessary if only one thread updates *accuracy
// Investigate opportunities for parallel reduction for better scalability
