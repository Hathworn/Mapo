```c
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergence by consistently using warp-level primitives
// Consider using shuffle instructions for intra-warp reductions
// Limit the number of synchronizations to reduce overhead
```
