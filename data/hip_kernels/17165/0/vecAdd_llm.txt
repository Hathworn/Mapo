```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced to improve performance.
// Balance the block and grid sizes for optimal hardware utilization.
// Minimize bank conflicts by structuring data appropriately.
// Use loop unrolling if computational intensity allows.
