```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data into shared memory to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures properly
// Minimize the use of device functions that can introduce additional overhead
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
// Opt for more fine-grained parallelism by increasing the number of threads or optimizing block size
