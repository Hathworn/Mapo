```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory access
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed their operations before proceeding
// Optimize shared memory usage by limiting the number of threads accessing it
// Ensure that shared memory is only updated by a single thread to avoid race conditions
```
