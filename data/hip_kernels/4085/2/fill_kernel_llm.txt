// Ensure coalesced memory access by using i * INCX only if INCX != 1
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Use loop unrolling if N is large to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure optimal occupancy by choosing appropriate block size
