```
// Consider using float2 or float4 for input/output to optimize memory transactions
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize shared memory use and synchronization
// Replace atomicAdd with warp shuffle for more efficient parallel reduction
// Preload and cache input data in shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Consider reducing bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
