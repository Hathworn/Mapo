```
// Use shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to improve kernel performance
// Align data accesses to reduce memory latency
// Use vectorized memory loads if possible for coalesced memory access
// Reduce arithmetic operations within the loop to increase throughput
// Utilize registers effectively to minimize local memory usage
