```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data according to warp size.
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access.
// Reduce divergence by minimizing conditional logic within the thread.
// Optimize thread block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory to improve memory access efficiency.
