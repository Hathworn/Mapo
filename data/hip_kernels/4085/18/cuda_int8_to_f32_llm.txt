// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring input_int8 and output_f32 are properly aligned
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergence within warps by ensuring conditional statements are uniform among threads
// Adjust block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and resource utilization
