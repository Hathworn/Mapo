```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns to optimize memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Maximize occupancy by adjusting block size and shared memory usage if needed.
