```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for spatial data to improve memory access patterns.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory indices as much as possible.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if possible to help the compiler with aliasing assumptions.
// Evaluate thread block size to match the hardware architecture for optimal memory throughput.
