```
// Consider using shared memory to improve data access patterns and reduce global memory transactions.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data accesses with the natural warp size.
// Ensure that loads and stores are aligned to reduce memory access penalties.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of using vectorized data types for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Investigate kernel unrolling to enhance performance by reducing instruction overhead.
