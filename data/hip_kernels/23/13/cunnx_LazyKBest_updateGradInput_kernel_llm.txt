```
// Use shared memory to improve cache efficiency and reduce global memory accesses
// Pre-compute the index offset to simplify indexing calculations and minimize computation within loops
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory to ensure all threads have the correct data
// Unroll loops to allow processing of multiple elements per thread, increasing computational throughput
// Utilize thread boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access when unrolling loops
