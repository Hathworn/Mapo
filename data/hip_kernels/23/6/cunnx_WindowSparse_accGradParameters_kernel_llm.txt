```
// Consider using shared memory to efficiently cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by reducing the granularity of parallelism
// Use data coalescing for input, output, and weight accesses to optimize memory bandwidth
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can improve the performance of the nested loops
// Analyze occupancy and adjust the block size or number of threads if needed
