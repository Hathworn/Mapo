```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory traffic.
// Ensure all access patterns are aligned to achieve maximum throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce control logic overhead.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to ensure memory consistency while minimizing synchronization costs.
// Ensure that shared memory is used optimally to avoid bank conflicts.
