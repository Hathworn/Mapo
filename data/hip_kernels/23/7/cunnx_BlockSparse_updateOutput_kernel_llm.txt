```
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses
// Preload biases into shared memory to decrease repetitive global memory reads
// Unroll inner loop to increase instruction level parallelism
// Align memory accesses to prevent uncoalesced access patterns
// Consider using double buffering with shared memory to overlap computation and memory loads
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses by structuring data layout appropriately
// Utilize warp-level primitives for reduction operations to improve efficiency
