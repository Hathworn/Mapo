```
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure that each thread accesses memory locations with a stride to maximize coalescing.
// Balance load by distributing work evenly among threads in the block.
// Consider memory alignment and padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Optimize the input and output index calculation to minimize redundant operations.
// Avoid unnecessary type casting between float and int where possible.
// Evaluate use of __restrict__ qualifiers to help the compiler with potential optimizations.
