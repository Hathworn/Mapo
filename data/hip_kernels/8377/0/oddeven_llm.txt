```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by loading even and odd elements together
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory efficiently
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads to prevent race conditions
// Consider reducing shared memory usage for larger thread blocks
// Ensure that threads do not access shared memory out of bounds
// Optimize block size to achieve better parallelism and occupancy
