```
//Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
//Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
//Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
//Use loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput
//Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries to optimize transaction efficiency
