```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Ensure proper use of shared memory if data reuse occurs within the kernel
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust grid/block dimensions for optimal compute utilization
// Use __restrict__ for pointers if applicable to assist compiler optimizations
// Inspect and minimize bank conflicts or warp divergences if shared memory is used
