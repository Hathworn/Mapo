```
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant accesses to global memory
// Pre-cache calculated indices for enhanced memory efficiency
// Coalesce memory access patterns to optimize bandwidth usage
// Minimize thread divergence by maintaining consistent warp execution paths
// Ensure alignment of data structures for improved memory transactions
