// Consider optimizing memory access by using coalesced memory access patterns.
// Examine if shared memory usage effectively reduces global memory access latency.
// Verify the use of shared memory to ensure proper alignment and avoid bank conflicts.
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied for the first level of reduction to improve parallel efficiency.
