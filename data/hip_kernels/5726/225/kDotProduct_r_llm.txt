// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for partial sums
// Reduce shared memory usage by using dynamic allocation
// Use register for intermediate computation to minimize global memory access
// Unroll loop for reduction to optimize shared memory usage
// Use volatile for shared memory pointers to prevent unnecessary optimizations
