```
// Consider coalesced memory access by arranging threads to access continuous memory locations
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results within a block for reducing global memory accesses
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same path
// Align data structures to 32-byte boundaries to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider using warp-level primitives to perform reductions within a warp
