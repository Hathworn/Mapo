```
// Use shared memory where possible to reduce global memory access latency.
// Combine loops for Bcomp and Tcomp to minimize redundant accesses and enhance memory coalescing.
// Use atomic operations to prevent race conditions while updating shared resources.
// Optimize loop bounds and ensure stride optimizations for better memory access patterns.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed prior to accessing shared data.
