```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for input pointers to improve memory access performance
// Ensure array indexing is coalesced for better global memory bandwidth utilization
// Check for memory alignment to harness efficient global memory loads
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for temporary storage if applicable
// Minimize the use of conditional statements within the kernel for performance
