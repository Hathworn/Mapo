// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure data is coalesced by aligning memory access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing control flow
// Evaluate the use of vectorized loads/stores for improved memory bandwidth utilization
