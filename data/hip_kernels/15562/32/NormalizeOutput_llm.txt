```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for original and to_normalize pointers
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure stride covers all elements even if it's larger than num_elements
// Consider loop unrolling if num_elements is a known compile-time constant
