```
// Use shared memory to optimize access to hiprandState within the block
// Consider using warp shuffle for better random number distribution
// Minimize state initialization overhead by using cached memory if applicable
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning the data structures properly
// Investigate if using texture memory could improve performance for hiprandState access
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on the hardware characteristics
