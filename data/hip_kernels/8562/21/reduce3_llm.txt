```cpp
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to improve performance
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Use memory coalescing when loading data from global to shared memory
// Implement loop unrolling for more efficient reduction
// Leverage asynchronous memory transfers for better data movement
```
