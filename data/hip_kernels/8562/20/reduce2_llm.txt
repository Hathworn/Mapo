// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory efficiency
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous shared memory locations
// Use warp-synchronous programming techniques to potentially reduce __syncthreads() overhead
