// Avoid uncoalesced memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.  
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses for frequently used data.  
// Optimize thread block size for best memory throughput and occupancy.  
// Use loop unrolling within the kernel if applicable to reduce instruction overhead.  
// Minimize conditional checks within the kernel for performance.
