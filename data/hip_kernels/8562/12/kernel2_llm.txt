// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory, if shared memory is incorporated.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to allow compiler optimizations on memory access patterns.
// Investigate loop unrolling if there are any loops for further optimization.
