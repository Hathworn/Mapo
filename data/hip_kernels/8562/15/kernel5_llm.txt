```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory if applicable.
// Use loop unrolling for any repetitive computations within the kernel.
// Ensure block size is a multiple of warp size for better performance.
// Optimize thread blocks and grid size based on your specific hardware.
