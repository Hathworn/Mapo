```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements
// Minimize branch divergence by aligning execution paths where possible
// Use appropriate block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and hide latencies
// Prefetch data into registers to decrease global memory access latency
