```
// Utilize shared memory for neighboring data access to reduce global memory reads.
// Minimize divergent branches by checking boundaries outside of performance-critical loops.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable for neighboring data processing to improve computational throughput.
// Consider vectorizing memory operations if the data layout allows for coalesced access.
// Optimize pitched memory usage by ensuring it aligns with recommended memory alignment for the architecture.
