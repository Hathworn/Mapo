```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for g_dataA and g_dataB.
// Use float4 or float2 to load/store multiple data points at once where applicable.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Check if using __ldg() for read-only global memory access can improve performance.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy and parallelization.
