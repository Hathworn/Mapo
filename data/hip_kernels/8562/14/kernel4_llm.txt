```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if data is reused.
// Ensure that memory coalescing is achieved by accessing global memory in a sequential manner.
// If atomic operations or synchronization are needed, ensure they are efficiently placed.
// Assess the need for loop unrolling to maximize throughput when applicable.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory to improve performance.
// Align data structures and memory accesses to cache line boundaries to improve access times.
