```
// Use shared memory for thread collaboration to reduce global memory access
// Adjust size of shared memory based on shared memory limitations to optimize usage
// Accumulate results in a register to minimize memory access and improve performance
// Accumulate directly to avoid repeated memory access and reduce latency
// Single write to global memory to minimize write operations and improve performance
