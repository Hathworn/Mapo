```
// Consider optimizing memory access by coalescing global memory reads from 'buffer'
// Utilize shared memory effectively by ensuring all threads contribute with atomic operations 
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning 'temp' access patterns
// Ensure 'temp' array is fully utilized by all threads within the block
// Consider warp-synchronous programming for reducing overhead of __syncthreads()
// Explore the use of vectorized loads from 'buffer' to improve memory throughput
