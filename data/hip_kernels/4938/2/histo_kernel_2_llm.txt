// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed histogram data within a block
// Ensure coalesced memory access for buffer by aligning data and using continuous threads
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce contention when updating the histogram
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling if accessing multiple elements per thread
