```cpp
// Consider reducing the usage of atomic operations by using warp-level primitives
// Improve shared memory usage patterns by minimizing bank conflicts
// Evaluate using a larger block size for increased parallelism
// Test memory alignment for buffer access to enhance coalescing
// Analyze if using 32-bit integers for histogram may reduce contention
