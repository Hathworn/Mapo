```
// Consider coalescing memory access for input buffer to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Evaluate effectiveness of using larger shared memory if block size exceeds 256 for performance boost
// Ensure the warp-level synchronization is well-aligned to avoid potential read-after-write hazards
// Investigate latency hiding through increasing blocks if occupancy is underutilized
