```
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage by minimizing shared memory allocation for unused threads.
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations in reduction loops for faster convergence.
// Evaluate the benefits of using warp shuffle operations for reductions instead of shared memory when N is small.
// Ensure that shared memory accesses are coalesced to improve read/write performance.
// Monitor the number of threads per block to ensure they are a multiple of warp size for better efficiency.
// Consider double buffering for shared memory to overlap computation and memory loads.
