```
// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory for intermediate calculations
// Reduce global memory access by caching frequently accessed data in registers
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly
// Minimize divergence by structuring control flow to favor warp execution
// Balance block and grid dimensions to fully utilize the GPU resources
