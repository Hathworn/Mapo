```
// Use memory coalescing for d_s and d_normals for faster access
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate calculations of s_curr
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency
// Use double precision for critical calculations if precision is important
// Optimize block size and grid size configuration for specific GPU architecture
