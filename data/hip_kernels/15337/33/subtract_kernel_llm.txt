// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Ensure that the total number of threads matches the data size to avoid branch divergence
// Explore the use of shared memory if data reuse within a block is possible
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and efficient resource utilization
