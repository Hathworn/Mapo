```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory if data reuse is high and within a block to reduce global memory access
// Consider aligning data to 128 bytes for better memory access efficiency
// Use __restrict__ keyword to inform the compiler of non-aliasing pointers for optimization
// Balance the number of threads and blocks to fully utilize the GPU's compute capabilities
