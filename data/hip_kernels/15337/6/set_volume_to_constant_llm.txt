```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and synchronize threads
// Consider further optimizing shared memory usage by dividing work among threads
// Ensure that global memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory efficiency
// Evaluate if additional shared memory optimizations could be applied
