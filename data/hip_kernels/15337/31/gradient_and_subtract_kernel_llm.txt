// It may benefit from using shared memory to cache input data for reduced global memory access.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input and gradient arrays to improve performance.
// Utilize loop unrolling techniques for operations within the bounds check loops.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are chosen for optimal device occupancy.
