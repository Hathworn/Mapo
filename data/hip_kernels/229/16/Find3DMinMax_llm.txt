```
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize the number of conditions inside the inner loops for better performance.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive thread accesses are contiguous.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to ensure data consistency while minimizing synchronization overhead.
// Consider unrolling loops to reduce loop control overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.
