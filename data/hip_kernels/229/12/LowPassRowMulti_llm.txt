```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses by loading data into shared memory once per block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses when loading from global memory.
// Consider loop unrolling for kernel operations to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Avoid redundant loads by reusing data in registers for the convolution operation.
// Minimize synchronization points to reduce overhead and improve performance.
