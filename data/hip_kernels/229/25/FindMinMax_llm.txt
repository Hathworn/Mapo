```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses on d_Data for improved performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters if data is read-only
// Align block size to a power of 2 for more efficient reduction
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal and within device limits
// Evaluate if unrolling the loop could enhance performance due to reduced branch divergence
// Confirm that each warp is fully utilized for memory transactions
