```cpp
// Use unroll directives for optimization in loops for better memory throughput.
// Precompute Gaussian weights and store them in shared memory.
// Use shared memory to load data blocks for better coalesced memory access.
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() when working with shared memory.
// Minimize memory accesses by clamping within valid window bounds before loading.
// Accumulate results in shared memory for reduced memory overhead.
// Perform reduction steps in shared memory to improve parallel execution efficiency.
// Leverage non-maximum suppression to filter and enhance salient orientation peaks.
// Align memory boundaries optimally to reduce bank conflicts.
// Consider loop unrolling for histogram computation for optimal performance.
