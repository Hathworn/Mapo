```
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing shared memory footprint where possible.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by having threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed-length loops to increase performance.
// Prefetch data to shared memory if possible for better data reuse and reduced global memory access.
// Use __syncthreads() sparingly to minimize synchronization overhead.
