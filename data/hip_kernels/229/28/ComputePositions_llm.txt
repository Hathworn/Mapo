```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache g_Data2 values for neighboring positions
// Consider using __ldg() for frequently accessed read-only data
// Align data access by ensuring g_Data2 accesses are coalesced
// Group loads to g_Data3 and g_Data1 to reduce global memory transactions
// Use compiler intrinsics like __fdividef for faster division operations
// Ensure d_Ptrs is accessed in a coalesced manner for better performance
```
