```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use __ldg to read from global memory if the data is read-only for possibly better performance.
// Ensure that the shared memory size does not exceed the device capability for optimal performance.
// Attempt to minimize shared memory use or reuse shared memory space where possible.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring data is accessed in a way that minimizes conflicts.
