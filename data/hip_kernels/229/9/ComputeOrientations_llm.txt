```cpp
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Ensure all threads in a warp are busy to avoid warp divergence
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Align data accesses to minimize memory transaction overheads
// Group atomic operations to reduce contention and improve throughput
// Preload frequently accessed data into registers or shared memory
// Adjust thread block size for optimal occupancy and performance
// Evaluate memory coalescing opportunities for global memory access
