```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data access according to warp size
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Consider using vectorized data types for improved bandwidth usage
// Minimize divergence by organizing threads to follow similar code paths
```
