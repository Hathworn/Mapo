```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize thread divergence by avoiding divergent branches.
// Optimize data reuse by calculating and storing intermediate results.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for efficient access.
// Prefetch data to improve throughput.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory to maximize performance.
