// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure alignment of data accesses to avoid potential memory bank conflicts.
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency.
