// Consider using shared memory to store Rsup, Rinf, Surf, QRStar, DensStar, and Vazimutal_d for faster access.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of conditional checks and increment operations.
// Check if the data can be pre-loaded into registers to minimize global memory access.
// Evaluate the need for atomic operations to prevent race conditions on Qbase updates.
