```
// Consider coalesced memory access by reorganizing data structures
// Minimize shared memory usage when not necessary
// Explore use of texture memory for cache efficiency if applicable
// Balance occupancy by adjusting block size according to the register usage
// Evaluate if prefetching can reduce memory latency
