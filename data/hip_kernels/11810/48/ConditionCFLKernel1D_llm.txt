```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing data in linear fashion.
// Consider using shared memory for accumulating sums to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling further or varying degree of unrolling based on empirical data.
// Ensure that the division operation is optimized, potentially using precomputed values or fast division techniques.
