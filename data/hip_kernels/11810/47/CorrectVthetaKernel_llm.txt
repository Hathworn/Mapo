```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by aligning memory and ensuring sequential accesses for consecutive threads
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for frequently accessed data, such as Rmed, to minimize global memory accesses
// Check if loop unrolling could be beneficial for the main operation to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size for better utilization of GPU resources
