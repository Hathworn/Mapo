```
// Consider using __ldg to exploit read-only data cache for constant memory accesses.
// Ensure sufficient occupancy to mask memory latency effectively.
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing the use of shared memory.
// Use data prefetching to hide global memory access latency.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing when accessing global memory arrays.
// Reduce synchronization overhead by optimizing reduction operations.
