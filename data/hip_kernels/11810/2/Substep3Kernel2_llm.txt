// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations for Qplus
// Where possible, use shared memory to cache values that are accessed multiple times within a block like Rmed
// If possible, use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in sections accessed frequently
// Evaluate the presence of bank conflicts when using shared memory to further optimize memory accesses
