```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using appropriate block size and indexing
// Minimize shared memory conflicts by ensuring block size is a multiple of warp size
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments to aid compiler optimizations
// Ensure memory alignment for VthetaRes, VMed, and Vtheta to improve access speed
// Utilize shared memory if possible to minimize repeated global memory reads
```
