// Consider using shared memory to store values that are reused in multiple threads for faster access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory accesses where possible.
// Minimize conditionals inside the kernel to reduce divergence and improve performance.
// Reduce redundant calculations by storing constant values such as SigmaMed in register memory.
