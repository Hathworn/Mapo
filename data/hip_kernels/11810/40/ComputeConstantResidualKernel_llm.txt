```
// Use shared memory to cache VMed and invRmed to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for operations involving nsec
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure coalesced access for Vtheta
// Use block-wide synchronization if shared memory is utilized
// Ensure alignment for double precision variables to improve memory access speed
