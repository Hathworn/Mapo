// Consider increasing the memory throughput by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Utilize shared memory for improved memory access patterns and reduced latency
// Explore warp synchronization techniques to enhance the performance of parallel sections
// Investigate the use of atomic operations if reduction involves concurrent updates by multiple threads
