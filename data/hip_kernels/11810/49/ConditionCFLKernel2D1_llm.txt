// Consider coalesced memory access for Rinf, Rsup, Rmed, Vrad, Vtheta, Vmoy, SoundSpeed, DT2D arrays.
// Reuse loaded values from Rsup, Rinf, Rmed within a thread block to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Leverage shared memory if possible to cache frequently accessed values like Rsup, Rinf, Rmed within a block.
// Ensure Vresidual writes are coalesced to increase memory write efficiency.
// Consider aligning data structures to improve cache utilization.
