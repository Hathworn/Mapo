// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Ensure memory alignment to improve access times
// Minimize register usage to increase occupancy
// Use loop unrolling for better parallel performance
// Check for warp divergence and optimize conditional logic
