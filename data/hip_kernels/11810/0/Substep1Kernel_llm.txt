```c
// Consider reducing the number of global memory accesses by using shared memory for frequently used data.
// Unroll loops where possible to enhance parallel execution and improve memory coalescing.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to inform the compiler that pointers do not alias, enabling further optimization.
// Align data structures in memory to improve cache efficiency and access speed.
// Minimize branching within kernels to ensure warp execution efficiency.
// Reuse previously loaded data by exploiting data locality in shared or register memory.
