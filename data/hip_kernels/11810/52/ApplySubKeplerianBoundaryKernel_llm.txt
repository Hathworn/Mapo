```c
// Consider coalesced access for VthetaInt for improved memory access patterns
// Ensure Rmed is accessed in a coalesced manner to enhance memory throughput
// Reuse shared memory or register values if there are common calculations within threads
// Minimize divergent branches to optimize thread efficiency
// Prefetch data to registers when appropriate to hide memory latency
```
