// Consider using shared memory for Rmed to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for Label array for better performance
// Optimize block and grid sizes to match GPU architecture and maximize occupancy
// Investigate potential use of constant memory for pi and other fixed values
// Evaluate the use of inline functions for trigonometric operations if repeatedly called
