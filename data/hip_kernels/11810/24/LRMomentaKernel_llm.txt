```
// Precompute linear index to minimize index calculations
// Improve memory access patterns for Vrad by using coalesced access with (i+1)*nsec
// Reduce redundant calculations by precomputing ROmega for each i
// Precompute DensRmed to avoid recalculating it for each ThetaMomP and ThetaMomM
// Use modulo operation (j+1) % nsec to handle boundary conditions without explicit conditionals
