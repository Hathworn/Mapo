// Use shared memory to cache Rmed values within the block to reduce global memory access
// Utilize register for frequently accessed variables like dxtheta and invdxtheta
// Consider using texture memory for Qbase if access patterns benefit from cache locality
// Analyze the occupancy of the kernel to ensure optimal use of resources
