```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for Dens, RadMomP, and RadMomM
// Coalesced memory access for Dens array to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure that Rmed[i] is stored in a register to reduce redundant global memory access
// Use of inline calculations in denominator_rad and denominator_theta to minimize memory operations
