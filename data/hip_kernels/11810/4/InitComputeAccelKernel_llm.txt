```
// Consider coalescing memory access for CellAbscissa and CellOrdinate
// Ensure Rmed memory access is coalesced by using shared memory
// Use __restrict__ keyword for input pointers to enable better compiler optimizations
// Optimize loop unrolling if beneficial for the specific GPU architecture
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for optimal memory bandwidth utilization
