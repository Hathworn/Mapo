// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure proper synchronization (__syncthreads) for shared memory usage to prevent race conditions.
// Optimize memory coalescing by storing data in shared memory before accessing global memory.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce on shared memory for better performance.
