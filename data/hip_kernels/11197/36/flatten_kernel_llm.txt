```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Coalesce global memory access for better memory throughput
// Ensure memory alignment to improve access speed
// Consider using vectorized types for memory operations to leverage SIMD
// Experiment with different block sizes to find optimal parallelism
// Minimize the amount of data transferred between global memory and registers
// Evaluate the use of warp-synchronous programming where applicable
