```
// Consider using memory coalescing to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure the loop unrolling is done optimally for the specific hardware architecture
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access; temporary results are already stored in 'local'
// Reduce the number of memory transactions by adjusting the block and thread configuration
// Further optimize the reduction process by using parallel reduction techniques
// Ensure there are enough threads to cover all elements to avoid idle threads
