// Consider using warp-level primitives to accumulate results for better performance.
// Use atomic operations to update bias_updates to avoid race conditions.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads from delta array.
// Use shared memory more efficiently by loading data in larger chunks where possible.
