```
// Use a while loop for better control over the iteration and to avoid redundant operations
// Use a single loop with index checks to reduce control overhead
// Conditional assignment for clarity and reduced branching
// Move the pointer directly inside the loop to reduce calculations outside
// Increment index within the while loop for continuous checking
