```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures if possible
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate computations to reduce global memory access
// Assess memory hierarchy to minimize latency by optimizing memory transactions
// Explore loop unrolling for potential increase in computation efficiency
// Analyze if larger block size yields better performance while maintaining occupancy
