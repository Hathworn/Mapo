```
// Consider using shared memory for s[i] to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses for a, b, and c
// Minimize divergent branching by using conditional assignment
// Use const qualifiers for read-only pointers like a and s
// Evaluate the possibility of using asynchronous memory prefetching
