```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access when reading from x and writing to out.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for repeated calculations.
// Reduce the complexity of index calculations or pre-compute them if possible to save on-register time.
// Ensure that all thread blocks have balanced workloads to prevent some streaming multiprocessors from being underutilized.
