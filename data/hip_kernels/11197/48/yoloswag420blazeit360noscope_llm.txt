```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for input and rand arrays
// Optimize memory access by ensuring all threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate computations if applicable
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in the same warp execute the same path
// Assess register usage and reduce if possible to avoid register spilling
