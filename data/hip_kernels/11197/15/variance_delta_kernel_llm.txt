```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring all threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize register usage by optimizing data reuse within the loop.
// Implement thread block strategies (e.g., strip-mining) to optimize occupancy and balance load.
