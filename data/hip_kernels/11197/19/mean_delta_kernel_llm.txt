```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate sums for an entire block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory access patterns.
// Utilize memory prefetching to hide memory latency.
// Optimize thread-level parallelism by unrolling the innermost loop.
// Enable compiler optimizations to maximize performance.
