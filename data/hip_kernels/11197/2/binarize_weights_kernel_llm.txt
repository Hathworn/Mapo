```
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize memory access patterns
// Use shared memory if multiple threads need access to the same data
// Evaluate the possibility of using warp-level primitives or reductions
// Minimize the use of global memory operations within the loop
// Assess the feasibility of reducing the loop iterated variable range
