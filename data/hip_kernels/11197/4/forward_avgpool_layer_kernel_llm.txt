```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses in the loop
// Consider using __syncthreads() to coordinate threads while accessing shared memory
// Explore loop unrolling to improve the throughput of the for loop
// Ensure that float operations utilize FMA instructions if supported
