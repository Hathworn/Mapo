// Use shared memory for pred and truth arrays to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses for pred and truth arrays for better memory performance
// Consider loop unrolling to improve computation efficiency within the kernel
// Avoid branching by using ternary operators instead of if-statements when possible
