```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses;
// Ensure coalesced accesses by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations;
// Perform reduction with a loop for better thread execution convergence;
// Use volatile qualifier if necessary to ensure shared memory visibility across threads;
