// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for reduced global memory transactions.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by organizing data processing to minimize transaction inefficiencies.
// Investigate warp-level primitives for efficient data processing and synchronization within the kernel.
