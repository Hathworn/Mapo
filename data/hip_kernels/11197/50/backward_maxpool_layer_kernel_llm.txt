```
// Use shared memory for caching frequently accessed data like indexes to reduce global memory access
// Consider using a warp shuffle intrinsic to efficiently compute d across threads within a warp
// Ensure enough threads are launched to fully utilize the GPU, possibly by fine-tuning grid and block dimensions
// Minimize divergent branches in conditional statements to improve warp execution efficiency
