```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data used frequently to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing in the loop accessing x to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Use loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead in the accumulation loop
// Explore using warp-level primitives for more efficient parallel reduction
