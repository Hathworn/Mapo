```
// Minimize memory accesses by loading X[indexX] into a register before using it
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning INCX and INCY with warp size when possible
// Consider using shared memory if the same data is accessed multiple times within a block
// Optimize grid and block configuration to fully utilize GPU resources
