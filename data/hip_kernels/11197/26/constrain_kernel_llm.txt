```
// Use shared memory for thread-local caching if X is reused multiple times.
// Optimize INCX handling to align memory accesses for coalescing.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to fully utilize GPU SM resources.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if access stride (INCX) leads to non-coalesced patterns.
// Avoid redundant calculations for blockDim.x and gridDim.x within the loop.
