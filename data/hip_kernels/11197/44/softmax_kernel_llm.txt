```
// Optimize memory access pattern by using coalesced memory access
// Consider using shared memory for reduction operations
// Evaluate using vectorized memory loads and stores
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by reusing loaded values
// Align data structures to improve memory throughput
