```
// Use shared memory to cache elements for faster access and reduced global memory load
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning data access patterns with warp size
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead of loop control
// Minimize the number of mathematical operations within the loop
// Align data structures in memory for improved memory transfer alignment
