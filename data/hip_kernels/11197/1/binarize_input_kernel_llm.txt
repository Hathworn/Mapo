```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access performance
// Reduce global memory access by eliminating redundant calculations
// Calculate the mean once per thread block for efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure mean_shared is updated before usage
// Precompute mean to minimize calculation in binarization loop
