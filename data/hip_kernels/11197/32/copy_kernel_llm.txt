```
// Consider coalescing memory access in X and Y to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory if the kernel involves computations that can benefit from cached data.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads.
// Prefetch data for the next loop iteration to hide memory latency.
// Align data access to ensure aligned memory transactions if possible.
