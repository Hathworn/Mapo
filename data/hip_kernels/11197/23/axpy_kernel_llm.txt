```
// Use shared memory to cache portions of X and Y to reduce global memory access
// Consider using float2 or float4 for coalesced memory access if INCX or INCY is 1
// Ensure that the total number of threads is a multiple of warp size for better efficiency
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler with optimization
// Try to maximize occupancy by tuning the block size based on GPU architecture
