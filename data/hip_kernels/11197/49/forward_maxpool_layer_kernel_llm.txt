```c
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by handling consistent condition branches
// Check for unnecessary synchronization to reduce overhead
// Evaluate grid and block size to maximize occupancy
// Utilize vectorized memory operations if applicable
```
