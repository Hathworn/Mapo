```
// Consider increasing the size of shared memory buffer for larger blocks
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to avoid unnecessary synchronization
// Ensure memory coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Consider optimizing block size to maximize occupancy and minimize divergence
