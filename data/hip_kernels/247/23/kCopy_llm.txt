```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with contiguous data
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize loop control overhead
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on the hardware architecture to maximize occupancy
