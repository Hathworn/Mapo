```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for vec to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data and using contiguous memory access patterns.
// Evaluate the grid and block dimensions to ensure full GPU utilization and minimize instruction divergence.
// Verify if __fdividef is optimal for precision/performance trade-off on the target GPU architecture.
