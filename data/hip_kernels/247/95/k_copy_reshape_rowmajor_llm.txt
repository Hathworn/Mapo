```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access by threads.
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement in pointer arithmetic.
// Apply restrict keyword to pointers if applicable for better compiler optimization.
// Investigate use of complex math libraries which optimize FLOP efficiency.
