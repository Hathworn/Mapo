```
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage by ensuring memory alignment
// Evaluate if reducing shared memory size could improve occupancy
// Analyze if further loop unrolling benefits performance
// Check if there's redundant data loading into shared memory
// Inspect if using registers for frequently accessed variables improves speed
// Explore adjusting data prefetching strategies to hide latency
