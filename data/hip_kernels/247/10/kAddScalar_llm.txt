```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure that numElements is a multiple of stride for coalesced memory accesses.
// Consider using float2 or float4 to improve throughput with vectorized operations.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead.
// Check if gData and target can be padded and aligned for better memory operation efficiency.
