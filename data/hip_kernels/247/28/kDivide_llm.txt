// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better memory throughput.
// Verify that gridDim.x and blockDim.x are chosen to maximize GPU occupancy.
// Check if loop unrolling can further optimize the stride loop execution.
