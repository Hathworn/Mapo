// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Align pointers if possible to enable coalesced accesses
// Consider using vectorized data types for optimizing memory bandwidth
// Assess the use of warp shuffle operations for further reduction in iteration count
// Evaluate different block sizes to optimize occupancy and minimize execution time
