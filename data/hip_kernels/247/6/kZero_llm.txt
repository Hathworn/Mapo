```
// Use stride for better coalescing and efficiency
// Consider aligning data on 128-bit boundaries for optimal memory access
// Use __restrict__ keyword to enhance compiler optimization by indicating no overlap in data pointers
// Employ shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data occur within the block
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and data throughput
