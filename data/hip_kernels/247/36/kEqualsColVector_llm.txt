```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'mat' and 'tgtMat' to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory if 'vec' is reused multiple times within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure the kernel is launched with a multiple of the warp size for optimal performance.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring uniform execution paths within warps.
// Use pragma unroll to unroll the loop for better instruction-level parallelism if the stride condition is known at compile time.
