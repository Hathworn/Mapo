// Use shared memory to cache d_gxx, d_gxy, d_gxz, d_gyy, d_gyz, d_gzz values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by organizing data access patterns to be sequential.
// Cache frequently reused calculations like sqrt(p) to reduce redundant computation and improve performance.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data arrays to decrease memory latency.
