// Pre-compute column index to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use grid-stride loop to ensure processing of all elements and optimal load balancing.
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access contiguous memory.
// Analyze memory access patterns to ensure maximum memory throughput.
