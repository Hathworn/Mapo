```
// Use shared memory to cache vec for faster access by all threads in the block.
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize divergent warps by structuring if condition with likely outcomes.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable for fixed operations within the kernel.
