```
// Use coalesced global memory access patterns for a and b to improve memory throughput.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure enough blocks are launched to fully utilize the GPU's SMs for better performance.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if possible to help compiler optimizations.
// Consider further unrolling the reduction loop manually if the compiler does not do it automatically.
// Explore using atomic operations for reduction as an alternative if precision requirements are relaxed.
// Ensure numCols and numElements are divisible by DP_BLOCKSIZE to avoid partial warps.
