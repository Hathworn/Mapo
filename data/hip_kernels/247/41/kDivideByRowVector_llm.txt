```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads to read contiguous data
// Use shared memory to load vec[i] when possible to reduce global memory access
// Consider using warp-level primitives for efficient data handling
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy and throughput
