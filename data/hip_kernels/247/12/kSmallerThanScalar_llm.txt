```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use memory coalescing to improve access speed by ensuring contiguous memory access.
// Ensure scalar value is loaded into a register to minimize repetitive global reads.
// Verify that accesses to gData are coalesced for warp efficiency.
// Investigate warp divergence due to conditional statements.
