```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Unroll loops further if it leads to better instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure data accesses are coalesced to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Minimize conditional statements within kernel for more consistent execution.
