```
// Consider using shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for loading xyz2 into shared memory.
// Utilize __syncthreads() properly to avoid race conditions when accessing shared memory.
// Unroll loops when processing buf data to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Reduce the number of branches by optimizing condition checks.
