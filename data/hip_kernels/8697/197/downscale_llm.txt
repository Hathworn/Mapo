```
// Consider reducing global memory accesses by utilizing shared memory.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Reduce redundant calculations by pre-computing repeated expressions and storing them in local variables.
// Ensure enough threads per block to maximize GPU occupancy while considering register and shared memory usage.
