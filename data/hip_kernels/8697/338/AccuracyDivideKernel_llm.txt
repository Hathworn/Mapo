```
// Ensure the accuracy pointer is accessed by a single thread to reduce contention
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency if accuracy is used by other threads
// Consider memory alignment and coalescing to improve memory access efficiency if necessary
// Minimize use of global memory by keeping frequently accessed data in registers if applicable
