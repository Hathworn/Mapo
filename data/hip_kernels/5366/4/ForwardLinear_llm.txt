// Optimize further by minimizing bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Consider using loop unrolling for the innermost loop to improve performance
// Evaluate using memory coalescing to optimize global memory access
// Ensure proper alignment for shared memory arrays to enhance coalescing
// Assess impact of increasing block size on shared memory usage and occupancy
// Investigate alternate tiling strategies for better cache utilization
