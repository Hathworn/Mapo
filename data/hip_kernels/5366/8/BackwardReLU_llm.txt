```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for dA and dZ arrays.
// Align memory accesses to warp size to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block.
// Utilize vectorized data types if applicable to increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy and fully utilize the GPU cores.
// Balance the workload among blocks to ensure consistent execution time across the grid.
