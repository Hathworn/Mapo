// Use shared memory for dZ and A to minimize global memory access.
// Implement vectorized loading for faster memory access.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of a loop.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed variables like lr.
