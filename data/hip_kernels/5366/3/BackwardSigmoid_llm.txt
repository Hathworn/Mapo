```
// Use __restrict__ keyword to indicate that the pointers do not alias
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Use vectorized operations to load and store multiple elements at once if possible
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to benefit from caching
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data and using contiguous threads
// Try to minimize the use of atomic operations and reduce branch divergence
