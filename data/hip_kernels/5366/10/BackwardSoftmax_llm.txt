```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to possibly enable additional optimizations
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring the kernel launch parameters fit within shared memory limits
// Unroll loops where applicable to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Evaluate if increasing block size could lead to better occupancy and performance
