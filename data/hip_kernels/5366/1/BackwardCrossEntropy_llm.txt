```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads and writes in the global kernel
// Reduce shared memory usage and aim for effective use of registers
// Ensure minimal data dependencies and promote parallel computation
// Verify alignment to prevent non-coalesced memory accesses
// Ideally, use warp-synchronous programming to reduce latency
