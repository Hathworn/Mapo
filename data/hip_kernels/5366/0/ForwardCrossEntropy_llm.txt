```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Apply loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput
// Utilize grid-stride loops for improved loop robustness
// Ensure proper alignment of memory to enhance performance
// Evaluate reducing atomicAdd usage for better parallel efficiency
