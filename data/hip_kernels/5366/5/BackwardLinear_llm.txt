```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the dZ array to enhance global memory efficiency.
// Consider allocating shared memory to hold a tile of the dZ array to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Ensure the sharedW array is used optimally by minimizing divergent threads within the same warp.
// Evaluate if the __syncthreads() calls can be reduced or repositioned to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Explore the use of vectorized data types (e.g., float4) for improved memory transaction performance.
