```
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure memory access pattern is optimal to leverage GPU's warp efficiency
// Minimize context switching by optimizing block and grid dimensions for full occupancy
// Consider aligning data structures to improve access times and reduce padding
