```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input_k and target_k to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use __restrict__ keyword if possible to hint the compiler about non-aliasing pointers.
// Ensure shared memory buffer is accessed without bank conflicts.
// Balance the workload evenly among threads to prevent some threads from being idle.
// Explore use of warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize synchronization overheads.
