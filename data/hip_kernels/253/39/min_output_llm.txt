```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for coalesced memory access.
// Ensure that input array is aligned for optimal memory access patterns.
// Utilize loop unrolling further to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Verify if memory access patterns are optimal for GPU memory architecture.
