```
// Ensure coalesced access by aligning memory accesses across threads
// Use shared memory to store temporary calculations to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if beneficial for performance on target hardware
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing intermediate variable usage
// Utilize memory prefetching if applicable to overlap computation and data transfer
