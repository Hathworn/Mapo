// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads and writes.
// Minimize the use of shared memory by caching frequently accessed values in registers.
// Consider loop unrolling for the output dimension loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Use atomic operations judiciously to prevent serialization and maximize parallelism.
