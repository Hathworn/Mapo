// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase parallel execution
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory throughput
// Minimize register pressure by reusing variables and optimizing arithmetic operations
