```
// Optimize memory access by utilizing shared memory if possible to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure memory coalescing to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to mitigate branching overhead and enhance performance.
// Use const qualifiers for the read-only variables in the kernel to potentially enable better optimizations.
