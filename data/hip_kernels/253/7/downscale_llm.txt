```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store data already fetched from global memory for each block.
// Employ coalesced memory accesses by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Analyze if utilizing texture memory or read-only cache improves access patterns.
// Experiment with different numbers of threads per block to find optimal configuration for memory access patterns.
