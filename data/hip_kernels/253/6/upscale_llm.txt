```
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access whenever possible
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance
// Minimize register usage to avoid spilling to local memory
// Optimize the block size configuration for better occupancy
// Reduce branch divergence by organizing threads efficiently
```
