```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by adjusting memory pointers and offsets
// Consider using shared memory to temporarily cache frequently accessed data
// Reduce the number of slow atomic operations if possible by data rearrangement
// Explore loop unrolling to improve instruction throughput
// Evaluate using texture memory for read-only texture data if applicable
