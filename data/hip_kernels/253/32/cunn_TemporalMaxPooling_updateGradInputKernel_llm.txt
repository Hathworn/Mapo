```
// Consider using shared memory to load features into each block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Try to optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive data elements.
// Use half-precision floats if precision requirements allow in order to increase throughput.
// Ensure indices_data is read in a coalesced manner for improved memory bandwidth usage.
// Investigate reducing register usage by using fewer variables or sharing among threads.
