```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster memory access.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve throughput.
// Use __ldg to load read-only data for improved memory bandwidth.
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns.
// Use atomics sparingly to avoid synchronization bottlenecks.
