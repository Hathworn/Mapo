// Consider using shared memory to store temporary results to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning memory accesses across warp threads
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase execution efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp to improve execution parallelism
