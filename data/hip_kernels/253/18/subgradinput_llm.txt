```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to improve global memory read/write efficiency.
// Ensure that gradOutput and gradInput accesses are coalesced as much as possible.
// Minimize divergent threads within warps when iterating over the output dimensions.
// Evaluate loop unrolling for inner loops (ky, kx) to potentially improve performance.
// Utilize shared memory for weight if accessed frequently and reused multiple times.
