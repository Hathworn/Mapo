```cpp
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for input and target pointers to optimize memory access
// Ensure coalesced access by examining memory access patterns for input and target arrays
// Consider loop unrolling inside the inner loop for small ntarget
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for reduction instead of shared memory
// Minimize shared memory usage by using warp-level reduction techniques
```
