```
// Consider using shared memory for gradOutput to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for gradOutput to increase memory throughput.
// Verify that the use of atomics does not cause performance bottlenecks due to contention.
// Explore loop unrolling for inner loops (kH, kW) to enhance instruction level parallelism.
// Check if rearranging thread block dimensions improves cache utilization.
