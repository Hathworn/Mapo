```
// Consider consolidating memory access patterns for gradOutput, gradInput, indices_x, and indices_y.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use coalesced memory accesses where possible to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure proper alignment of pointers to leverage memory coalescing.
// Explore loading multiple elements per thread if resources permit.
// Minimize use of atomic operations if possible to reduce contention and serialization.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient reduction if applicable.
