```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory loads of gradOutput.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Unroll inner loops over kW and kH to improve performance.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to minimize idle threads.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for input using appropriate data structures.
// Use texture or read-only cache for the input to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Launch enough blocks to fully utilize the GPU and hide latency.
