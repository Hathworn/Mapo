```
// Avoid shared memory where possible to reduce access overhead
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns by aligning memory access across threads
// Unroll inner loops to improve instruction throughput
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to enable more compiler optimizations
// Ensure data is organized to benefit from cache locality
