```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within the block is possible
// Strive to keep the kernel lightweight to reduce register usage
// Evaluate if compiler flags can optimize memory access patterns further
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are chosen to efficiently use the GPU resources
