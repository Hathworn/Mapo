```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
// Ensure memory access is aligned for efficient fetches
// Avoid using unnecessary conditional statements inside kernels to reduce branch divergence
```
