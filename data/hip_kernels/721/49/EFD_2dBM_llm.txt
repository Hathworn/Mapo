```
// Use shared memory more extensively to improve memory access patterns
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve performance
// Load multiple contiguous elements with a single memory transaction when possible
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring proper memory layout
// Optimize boundary condition checks by combining into fewer branching instructions
// Consider storing some variables in registers for faster access
