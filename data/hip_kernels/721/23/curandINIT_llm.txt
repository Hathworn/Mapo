```
// Consider using shared memory to store part of d_states for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning d_states with preferred memory patterns
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have finished initializing state before use
// Ensure the grid size is optimized to keep all SMs fully utilized
// Minimize register usage by limiting complex operations inside the loop
