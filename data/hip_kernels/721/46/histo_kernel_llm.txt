// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced reads in the loop.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize access to global memory.
// Reduce the number of atomic operations by accumulating in local/shared memory.
// Optimize the loop unrolling factor to balance between latency and computation.
// Explore using __ldg for read-only data to improve cache efficiency.
