// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access overhead
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth
// Ensure gridDim.x and blockDim.x are optimal for GPU occupancy
// Consider using atomic operations if necessary to avoid race conditions
// Profile kernel for bottlenecks and adjust block and grid sizes accordingly
