```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Explore the use of texture memory for read-only data to increase cache hit rates
// Reduce divergent branching within the loop to minimize warp serialization
```
