```
// Consider optimizing memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns for d_a, d_b, and d_c
// If d_a, d_b, and d_c are contiguous and aligned, then memory access should already be optimized
// If further optimization is needed, assess if shared memory would be beneficial for reducing global memory access latency
// For larger data sizes, ensure adequate grid and block size configuration to maximize occupancy
