// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid repeated division for pitch calculations by caching pitch values in registers
// Minimize divergent branches by simplifying boundary conditions and loop unrolling
// Merge common expressions to reduce the number of operations
// Ensure data alignment to reduce access latency
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth
