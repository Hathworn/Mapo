```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses for better performance.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to optimize occupancy and control warp execution.
// Optimize for memory bandwidth by ensuring that each thread reads and writes contiguous memory locations.
// Evaluate the benefit of loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput.
