```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by utilizing proper data alignment and layout
// Use asynchronous memory operations to overlap computation and data transfer
// Apply vectorized memory operations if applicable to improve memory throughput
