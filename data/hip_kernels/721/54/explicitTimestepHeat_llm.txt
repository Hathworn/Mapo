// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Use __restrict__ pointers to hint the compiler about non-aliasing
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Explore using vectorized memory operations for improved throughput
// Optimize memory allocation and deallocation to avoid overheads
