```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure coalesced reads/writes
// Investigate possibility of using texture memory for read-only data
// Ensure hiprandState_t allocation is using aligned memory access
// Check alignment of d_a to improve memory coalescing
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to maximize occupancy
