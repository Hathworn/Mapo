// Consider using shared memory to cache hiprandState_t data and reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize thread divergence by structuring loops and conditions to align thread execution paths.
// Evaluate using texture memory for reading frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
