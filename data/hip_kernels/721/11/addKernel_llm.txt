```cuda
// Utilize shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses for vectors a, b, and c to improve performance
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations if data transfer is a bottleneck
// Check for memory alignment to potentially enhance memory access speed
