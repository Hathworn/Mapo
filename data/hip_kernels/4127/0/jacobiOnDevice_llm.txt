// Consider optimizing memory coalescing by ensuring x_next is accessed sequentially
// Utilize shared memory for partial results to minimize global memory access
// Ensure A is accessed in a coalesced manner for improved memory throughput
// Evaluate if a different block size can lead to better resource utilization
