```
// Use shared memory to cache dimendionsSizes if reused frequently
// Prefetch data by loading packDimensions into shared memory
// Coalesce memory accesses for packMeasures in the inner loop
// Consider using texture memory for measures if access pattern benefits
// Minimize global memory writes with atomic operations if applicable
