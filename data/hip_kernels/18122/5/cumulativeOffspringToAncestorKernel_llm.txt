```
// Consider coalesced memory access for the cumulativeOffspring and ancestor arrays to improve performance.
// Minimize redundant access to cumulativeOffspring by storing accesses in registers.
// Ensure threads within a warp access consecutive memory addresses to utilize memory coalescing.
// Check if shared memory could be utilized to store temporary variables to reduce global memory traffic.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can enhance performance in the inner loop over numCurrentOffspring.
// Profile and adjust block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and balance between computation and memory access.
