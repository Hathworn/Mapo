```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads from global memory
// Minimize branch divergence by avoiding unnecessary if conditions
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Use efficient in-block reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Use atomic operations cautiously to avoid performance bottlenecks
