```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Use of max function provides improved performance over conditional statements.
// Ensure coalesced accesses by aligning data and access patterns.
// Use parallel reduction to minimize synchronization overhead and computation time.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts through careful arrangement of data accesses.
