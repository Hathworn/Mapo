```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for g_group_contents
// Ensure data for g_vx_i, g_vy_i, g_vz_i is accessed with coalescing
// Align g_vx_o, g_vy_o, g_vz_o for optimal write performance
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage if applicable
// Use const restrict to help with compiler optimization
// Balance the workload across threads efficiently
