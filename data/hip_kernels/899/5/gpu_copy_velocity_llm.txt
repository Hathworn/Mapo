```
// Unroll loops to improve memory throughput
// Use __restrict__ to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
// Consider reading data into shared memory if it helps reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread block size and grid size for better occupancy
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve performance
