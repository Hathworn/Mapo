// Consider using memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency
// Implement additional loop unrolling techniques for better performance
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration
// Ensure shared memory usage is efficient to reduce bank conflicts
// Evaluate the possibility of using vectorized operations for further performance gains
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory to minimize global memory latency
