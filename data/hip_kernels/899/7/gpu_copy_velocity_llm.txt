```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for both input and output arrays
// Ensure shared memory utilization is within hardware limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Consider using __ldg() for loading read-only data for potential L1 cache benefits
// Balance workload across blocks and threads to maximize occupancy
