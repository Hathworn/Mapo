```
// Use coalesced memory access for g_heat
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts
// Leverage constant memory for frequently accessed constants
// Use vectorized loads/stores when possible
// Ensure data reuse from shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize usage of registers to maximize occupancy
// Apply loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance
