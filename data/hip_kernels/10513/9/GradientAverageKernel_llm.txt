```
// Optimize memory coalescing patterns for global memory access
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring conditional branches execute uniformly
// Ensure shared memory is accessed in a coalesced manner to improve performance
// Consider using loop unrolling for inner loops to enhance instruction parallelism
// Maximize use of registers for temporary variables to reduce memory latency
// Evaluate the possibility of further optimizing shared memory usage
