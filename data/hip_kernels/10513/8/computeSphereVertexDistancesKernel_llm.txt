```
// Load vertex data using coalesced access pattern to optimize memory bandwidth
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by caching neighboring vertex data
// Minimize global memory accesses through caching mechanism of shared memory
// Separate block-wise computations to reduce warp divergence and improve execution efficiency
// Implement wider vector loading to better utilize shared memory capacity
// Use faster intrinsic mathematical operations for computing dot products and norms
