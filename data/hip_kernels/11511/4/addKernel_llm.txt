```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for arrays 'a', 'b', and 'c'
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Minimize memory latency by ensuring data is accessed in a cache-friendly manner
// Evaluate warp divergence and ensure threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider adjusting block size to optimize occupancy and maximize parallelism
