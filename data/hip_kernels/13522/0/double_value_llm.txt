```
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to suggest compiler more optimization
// Consider using shared memory for frequent data access to reduce global memory traffic
// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring continuous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Check if data can be arranged to improve memory alignment, minimizing memory access latency
