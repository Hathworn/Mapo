// Load the uniform value into shared memory at the beginning to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Simplify address calculation to reduce instruction overhead
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded the uniform value before proceeding
// Combine conditional checks to minimize branching and improve control flow
