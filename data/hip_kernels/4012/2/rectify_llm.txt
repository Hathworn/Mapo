```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use coalesced access pattern for better memory access efficiency
// Ensure thread blocks have a sufficient number of threads to maximize occupancy
// Explore whether adjusting the stride size benefits the memory access pattern
// Profile memory bandwidth utilization to identify other potential bottlenecks
