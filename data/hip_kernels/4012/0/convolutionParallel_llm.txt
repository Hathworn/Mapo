```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses for `image` and `new_image`.
// Utilize shared memory for the weights to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Use `__syncthreads()` to synchronize threads before using shared memory values.
// Optimize the loop by unrolling if possible to improve performance.
// Consider using constant memory for the weights if they do not change at runtime.
// Use `fminf` and `fmaxf` to clamp values efficiently in the range [0, 255].
// Calculate the alpha channel conditionally for better performance.
