```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for shared memory loading
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by optimizing access patterns
// Ensure __syncthreads() is placed only when necessary to optimize parallel execution
// Consider using texture or surface memory for read-only data to improve cache efficiency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions according to the specific hardware capabilities
