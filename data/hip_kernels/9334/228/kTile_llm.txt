```
// Use __hip_divider and __hip_remainder to replace division and modulus for efficient index calculation
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by iterating over target elements in steps of numThreads
// Prefetching data from global memory to shared memory could be considered to improve memory access latency
// Evaluate if using constant memory for certain inputs can optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Adjust block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy while ensuring sufficient memory bandwidth utilization
