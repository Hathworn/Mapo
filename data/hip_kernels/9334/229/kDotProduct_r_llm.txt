```
// Unroll loops to increase memory access efficiency
// Use shared memory to store partial results for reduction
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed their computation
// Reduce bandwidth by using shared memory for intermediate steps
// Optimize reduction by unrolling the last warp
// Minimize global memory access by storing block results in shared memory first
```
