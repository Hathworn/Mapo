// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for intermediate results.
// Utilize loop unrolling in reduction to minimize the number of iterations.
// Leverage volatile keyword to prevent unwanted compiler optimizations in critical section.
// Aim to maximize thread utilization with blockDim tuning.
