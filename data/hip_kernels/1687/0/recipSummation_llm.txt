```
// Use more blocks if len is large to improve parallelization
// Consider loading multiple elements per thread to reduce iteration count
// Ensure coalesced memory access for `recip` and `data` arrays
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads(), only when necessary
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing its footprint
// Align shared memory access to improve memory performance
