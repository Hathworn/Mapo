```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement coalesced memory access in the loop
// Apply thread stride loop for spatial accumulation to maximize occupancy
// Perform in-block reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Use warp-level reduction to enhance performance within active warps
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() calls for efficiency
```
