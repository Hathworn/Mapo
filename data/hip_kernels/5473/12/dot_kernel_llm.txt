```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Implement loop unrolling in inner loops to enhance performance
// Align memory access patterns to optimize memory coalescing
// Attempt reducing the floating-point divisions inside the loop for better performance
// Explore using atomic operations if race conditions exist when updating `delta`
