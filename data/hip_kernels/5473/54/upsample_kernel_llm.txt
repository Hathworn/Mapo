```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for reused values to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data access patterns.
// Use LDG to load values if they will be reused and are read-only.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Prefetch data if possible to hide latency.
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy.
// Use appropriate loop unrolling for frequent operations.
