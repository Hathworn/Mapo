```
// Utilize grid-stride loop to maximize memory coalescing and parallel efficiency.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for faster reduction within shared memory.
// Ensure shared memory usage is minimized for better occupancy.
// Optimize the calculation of index inside the loop to minimize redundant operations.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize only when necessary to improve performance.
