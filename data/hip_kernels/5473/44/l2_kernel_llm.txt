```
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring the data in 'pred' and 'truth' is aligned properly
// Use shared memory to store 'pred' and 'truth' data in order to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure 'delta' and 'error' arrays are aligned and properly distributed to avoid bank conflicts
// Employ loop unrolling techniques if applicable to further optimize calculations within the kernel
