```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when accessing delta and indexes
// Consider coalesced memory access for prev_delta to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Analyze warp divergence in loop conditions to optimize control flow
// Use __restrict__ pointers for delta, prev_delta, and indexes to help compiler optimize with assumptions of no aliasing
// Reduce integer arithmetic for index calculations by precomputing invariant terms outside the loop if possible
