// Use __ldg() for read-only accesses to potentially improve caching performance
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for j and i loops to reduce loop overhead
// Use warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of __shared__ memory for efficiency
// Verify alignment of variance_delta writes to avoid non-coalesced memory accesses
