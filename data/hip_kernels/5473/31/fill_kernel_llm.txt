```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring INCX is 1
// Align data in memory for optimal access patterns
// Minimize shared memory usage if not necessary
// Use __restrict__ qualifier if applicable to pointers to aid compiler optimization
// Ensure blocks and threads are optimally configured for the target device
// Check for potential bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Consider loop unrolling manually or using compiler directives for further optimization
