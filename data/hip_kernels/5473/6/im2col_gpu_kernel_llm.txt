```
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous data
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and minimize latency
// Prefetch data into registers to avoid repeated global memory loads
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure appropriate grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
