// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data and memory indices
// Minimize conditional branches within the kernel to avoid warp divergence
// Use vectorized operations to improve data throughput and efficiency
// Evaluate warp size and align data processing to optimize hardware utilization
