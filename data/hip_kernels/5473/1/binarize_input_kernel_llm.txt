```c
// Consider coalescing global memory access for 'input' to improve memory throughput.
// Use more efficient shared memory reduction techniques to reduce computational overhead.
// Reduce divergence by minimizing conditional statements within warps.
// Assess if loop unrolling could enhance performance in the for-loop processing 'n' elements.
// Optimize synchronization by reducing the number of __syncthreads() if possible.
// Explore using warp-level primitives for more efficient mean computation and data access.
