```
// Use shared memory to store mean values to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate sum results to improve memory locality.
// Consider loop unrolling for the spatial loop to potentially enhance performance.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Investigate using float4 data type for memory access to utilize vectorized operations.
