// Consider using shared memory to cache s[i], a[i], and b[i] within a block for faster access.
// Check if coalesced memory access is ensured for arrays a, b, s, and c.
// Evaluate the possibility of using vector types (e.g., float4) for improved memory access patterns.
// Optimize grid and block configuration to maximize occupancy and minimize thread divergence.
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations if data transfer overlaps computation.
