```
// Consider aligning memory accesses for better memory coalescing
// Analyze whether using shared memory would reduce global memory access latency further
// Explore if loop unrolling can be adjusted based on size constraints
// Evaluate using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Check for suitable memory prefetching opportunities
