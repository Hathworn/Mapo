// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to improve instruction throughput
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts during accumulation
// Implement warp-level parallel reduction to optimize shared memory use
// Use atomic operations for final bias update to ensure threads' correct write-back
