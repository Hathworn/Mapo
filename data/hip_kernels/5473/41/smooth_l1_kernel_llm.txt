```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and reuse data within the block if possible.
// Consider vectorized loads and stores to optimize memory throughput.
// Analyze the compiler's ability to unroll the loop and suggest pragma unroll directives if beneficial.
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring branching is aligned across warps.
// Ensure data alignment for pred, truth, delta, and error arrays to leverage faster memory access.
