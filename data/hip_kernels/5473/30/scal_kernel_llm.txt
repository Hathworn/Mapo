```
// Use shared memory to temporarily store X values accessed by multiple threads
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory access waits
// Ensure usage of coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling within the kernel to increase instruction throughput
