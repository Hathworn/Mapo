```
// Consider coalesced memory access for reading and writing to image array
// Use shared memory to load neighbouring pixel data to reduce global memory access
// Evaluate potential for loop unrolling in hsv_to_rgb_kernel function
// Consider using __ldg() intrinsic for read-only accesses to global memory
// Assess benefits of using float2 or float4 for color operations to reduce operations
// Check if constant memory can be utilized for any static data
