```
// Consider using shared memory for the input data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Preload the largest value for normalization into a register to minimize recalculations.
// Explore coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure the data accessed by threads is aligned for better memory performance.
// Consider launching more blocks to improve occupancy in case the kernel is compute-bound.
