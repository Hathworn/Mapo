```
// Consider coalesced memory access by adjusting index calculations for input array access
// Ensure thread divergence is minimized by aligning loop iterations with warp size where possible
// Leverage shared memory to store intermediate results if the input array dimensions are large
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure maximum memory throughput
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy
