```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access time for frequently accessed variables.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced accesses.
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize occupancy and performance.
// Minimize divergent branches inside the if condition by restructuring code logic.
// Use __syncthreads() if synchronization between threads is necessary for complex operations.
