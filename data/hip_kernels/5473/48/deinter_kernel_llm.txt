```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data on memory boundaries
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Consider loop unrolling for additional performance improvements
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to optimize compiler's memory access assumptions
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for the hardware
