```cpp
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous data
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize fast math operations (like __logf) for better performance
// Ensure optimal block and grid sizes for efficient resource utilization
```
