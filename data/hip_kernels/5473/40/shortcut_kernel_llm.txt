```
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring thread indices map to contiguous memory locations
// Consider shared memory to cache repeatedly accessed data within a block
// Optimize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput
// Align memory accesses to reduce memory latency and increase transaction efficiency
