```
// Consider aligning data access to ensure coalesced memory transactions.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same memory region to reduce global memory transactions.
// Employ grid-stride loops to process larger data sizes beyond the block size.
// Pre-compute any reusable values outside of the main loop to minimize recomputations.
