```
// Consider using coalesced global memory access patterns where possible.
// Ensure use of shared memory is beneficial by reducing bank conflicts.
// Consider reducing the use of atomic operations which can be a bottleneck.
// Explore loop unrolling to improve the throughput of loops.
// Use warp-level primitives to further optimize parallel reductions.
