```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Perform loop unrolling in the device function for larger n to increase instruction level parallelism
// Consider aligning data in global memory for coalesced access
// Use __syncthreads() if necessary when using shared memory to prevent race conditions
// Optimize memory access patterns by considering thread index usage and avoiding bank conflicts
