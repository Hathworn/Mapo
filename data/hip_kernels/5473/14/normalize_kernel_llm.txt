```
// Consider using shared memory for 'mean' and 'variance' to reduce global memory access latency.
// Preload 'mean[f]' and 'variance[f]' into registers to reduce repetitive memory access in the loop.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access for 'x[index]'.
// Experiment with different block sizes to ensure kernel execution efficiency.
