// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning INCX to the warp size
// Consider using shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize divergence
// Use pointer arithmetic instead of multiplication in the access pattern for X
