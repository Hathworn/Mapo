```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize access to X and Y arrays.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve performance.
// Strided loop helps avoid thread underutilization in case of fewer elements.
// If NX and NY are large, consider using multiple kernels or splitting computation to manage resources effectively.
// Pay attention to bank conflicts when using shared memory in future optimizations.
