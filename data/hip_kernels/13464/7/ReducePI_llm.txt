```c
// Consider using float4 or float2 instead of float for vectorized operations
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved performance
// Use multiple streams to overlap computation and data transfer
// Optimize block and grid size based on hardware specifications
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() for better performance
