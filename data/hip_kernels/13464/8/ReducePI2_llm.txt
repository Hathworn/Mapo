```
// Optimize memory access patterns for shared memory usage
// Minimize thread divergence within warp-synchronous reduction
// Consider unrolling the loop for the reduction phase
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory while loading data into shared memory
// Use atomic operations judiciously if needed for the final reduction step
