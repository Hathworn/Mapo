```
// Unroll loop for better performance by using stride
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Optimize memory coalescing to ensure that threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to utilize more of the GPU resources
// Profile the kernel to identify and eliminate potential bottlenecks in memory access
