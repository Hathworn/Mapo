```
// Use shared memory for data array to improve memory access speed
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring data array is accessed in a contiguous manner
// Avoid using printf in performance-critical kernels as it can significantly degrade performance
// Consider marking the data array with __restrict__ to potentially enable further compiler optimizations
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy
