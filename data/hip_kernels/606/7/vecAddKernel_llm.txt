```
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous accesses are made by consecutive threads
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for improved memory throughput
// Optimize block and grid size to maximize occupancy and minimize execution divergence
