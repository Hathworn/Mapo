```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Ensure coalesced access by aligning data structure to warp size
// Minimize register usage to prevent spilling into global memory
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Profile and optimize for memory bandwidth and latency constraints
```
