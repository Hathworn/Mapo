```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory layout for imageIn and imageOut arrays.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize access pattern to offsets array to minimize strided memory access.
// Consider employing vectorized memory operations for float2 types, such as using float4 if feasible.
// Reorganize thread block dimensions to maximize memory coalescing, especially for threadX and threadY.
