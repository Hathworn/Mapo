```cpp
// Use shared memory to further optimize memory access if applicable.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to global memory for improved performance.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to improve cache efficiency.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are chosen to match the GPU architecture for optimal occupancy.
