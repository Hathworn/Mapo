```
// Use shared memory to store tiles of imageIn to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns when accessing imageIn
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
// Use asynchronous memory loads if possible to hide memory latency
// Minimize register usage to increase occupancy
// Evaluate different block configurations for better performance
