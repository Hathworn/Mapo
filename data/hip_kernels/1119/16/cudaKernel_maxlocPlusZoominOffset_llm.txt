```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing memory in a sequential manner
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data from global memory
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like padStart and maxlocUpSample
// Optimize occupancy by choosing appropriate block size to hide memory latency
