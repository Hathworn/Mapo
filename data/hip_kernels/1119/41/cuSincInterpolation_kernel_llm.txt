```
// Use shared memory to store r_filter_ to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider aligning memory accesses to simplify coalescing and improve throughput.
// Reorder nested loops to exploit spatial locality and improve cache utilization.
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and potentially increase the performance.
