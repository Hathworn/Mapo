```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for imageIn to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if applicable.
// Ensure warps access memory in a coalesced manner for imageOut to optimize performance.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to better utilize available compute resources.
// Check memory alignment for inputs and outputs to leverage potential performance gains.
