```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses for maxloc.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by organizing threads along the y-direction for imageOut updates.
// Consider loop unrolling for inner loops to enhance performance.
// Align memory accesses to improve global memory access efficiency.
