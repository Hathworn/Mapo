// Consider using shared memory for data that is accessed multiple times by threads
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are configured to minimize warp divergence
// Check if coalesced memory access can be improved by restructuring data or access patterns
// Validate that __restrict__ pointers provide expected performance improvements
