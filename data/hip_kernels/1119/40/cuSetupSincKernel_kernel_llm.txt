```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Utilize registers for frequently used variables to avoid repeated global memory access.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to enhance memory throughput.
// Explore the use of loop unrolling if applicable to reduce the overhead of loop control.
// Assess the use of __syncthreads() if shared data is introduced to avoid race conditions.
