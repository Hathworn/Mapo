// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure that shared memory is utilized effectively to exploit faster access.
// Implement warp-based reduction to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Consider memory coalescing for enhanced access patterns.
// Optimize block size and thread count for maximum occupancy.
