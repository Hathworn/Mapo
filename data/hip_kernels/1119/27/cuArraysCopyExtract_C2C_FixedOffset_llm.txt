```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for imageIn and imageOut to hint at no aliasing.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory accesses to imageIn and imageOut.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure alignment of float2 data types for optimal memory throughput.
// Use half-warp strategies or loop unrolling if applicable to increase computational throughput.
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal occupancy based on the GPU architecture.
