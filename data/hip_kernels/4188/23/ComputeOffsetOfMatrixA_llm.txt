```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for col_sum
// Ensure N is small enough to fit col_sum into shared memory
// Implement warp-level synchronization for better efficiency if applicable
// Consider coalesced global memory access for output writes
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding or restructuring
// Assess occupancy and optimize blockDim.x for better resource utilization
