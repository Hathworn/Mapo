```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to enhance bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate the possibility of using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Avoid branching within the critical path to reduce warp divergence
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized by using strides that minimize cache misses
