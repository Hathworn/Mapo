```
// Ensure proper memory coalescing by calculating the flattened thread index and accessing data accordingly.
// Consider using shared memory to temporarily store delta_weightbias values for further optimization.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory, if used.
// Verify if the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the device architecture to maximize occupancy.
// Check for memory alignment to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Analyze if texture memory usage could enhance read access performance for specific data patterns.
