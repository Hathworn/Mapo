```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for better memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store row_sum and col_sum within each block for faster access.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branching by reordering conditions if possible.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce memory latency.
