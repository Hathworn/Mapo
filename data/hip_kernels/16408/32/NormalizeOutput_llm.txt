```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory reads.
// Load batch_index and class_index into shared memory at the start of the kernel.
// Ensure only one thread in the block loads data into shared memory to prevent race conditions.
// Use __syncthreads to guarantee all threads see the updated shared memory values.
// Use a stride loop to allow each thread to process multiple elements, improving data parallelism.
// Avoid repeated calculation of common expressions like blockDim.x * gridDim.x by storing them in a local variable if possible.
