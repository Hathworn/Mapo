// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access  
// Align data access patterns to utilize coalesced memory reads  
// Consider use of texture memory for read-only data if applicable  
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by checking alignment and data type size  
// Examine the possibility of using atomic operations for conflict-free updates  
// Assess loop unrolling for maximizing instruction throughput
