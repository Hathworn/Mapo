// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure matrix_a and matrix_b are accessed in a coalesced manner
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Improve data parallelism by better using block and thread dimensions for data tiling
// Minimize synchronization overhead by optimizing the computation loop
