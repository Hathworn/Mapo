```
// Suggestion: Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing input data and threads.
// Suggestion: Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data chunks to reduce global memory accesses.
// Suggestion: Optimize thread block size to fully utilize the GPU's memory bandwidth and compute capabilities.
// Suggestion: Validate if __syncthreads() is necessary; removing unnecessary synchronization can improve performance.
// Suggestion: Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by proper alignment of data structures if shared memory is utilized.
