```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory as a temporary storage
// Ensure data is coalesced when writing back to global memory
// Implement early exit to reduce unnecessary computations
// Make sure to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
