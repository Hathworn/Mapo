// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory access efficiency
// Use shared memory if appropriate to further optimize data access
// Ensure alignment of data to meet hardware access requirements
// Evaluate if using vectorized data structures could enhance performance
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and efficiency
