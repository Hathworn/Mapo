```
// Unroll the for loop to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by accessing ptrbias and ptroutput in a linear fashion.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
// Consider using float4 or similar vectorized types for memory operations to improve throughput.
