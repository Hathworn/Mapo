```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant calculations and improve performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns with warp memory layout
// Use threadIdx.x and threadIdx.y efficiently for independent memory accesses
// Minimize synchronization overhead by calculating offsets before the shared memory synchronization
// Reduce global memory accesses by caching values in shared memory
// Optimize data reuse by loading pixel values once and using them across multiple iterations
// Consider leveraging texture memory for better cache locality for input image pixel values
