```
// Consider unrolling the loop for loading inputs into shared memory to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by adjusting how masks and values are loaded.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring conditional branches are as uniform as possible.
// Preload shared memory and perform operations while minimizing bank conflicts.
// Benchmark impact of increasing shared memory usage to reduce global memory access frequency.
// Analyze occupancy for improving performance, potentially by tuning block size.
