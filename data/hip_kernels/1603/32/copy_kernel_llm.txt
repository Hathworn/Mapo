// Use shared memory to cache values and reduce global memory access
// Optimize coalesced memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for improved throughput
// Adjust the grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and resource usage
