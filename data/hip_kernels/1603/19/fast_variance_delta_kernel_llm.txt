```
// Unroll the loop for better memory coalescing
// Use shared memory effectively to store intermediate results
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring optimal data layout
// Minimize divergence by simplifying conditionals
// Perform reduction using warp shuffles for intra-warp communication efficiency
// Use constant memory for read-only data like mean and variance if possible
// Consider loop fusion to decrease global memory accesses
