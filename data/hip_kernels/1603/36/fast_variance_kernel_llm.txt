// Consider using coalesced memory access for better memory performance.
// Apply loop unrolling technique as demonstrated for improved execution speed.
// Focus on optimizing shared memory usage to minimize latency.
// Use parallel reduction efficiently to ensure faster accumulation of results.
// Ensure that memory reads and writes are aligned where possible for optimal throughput.
