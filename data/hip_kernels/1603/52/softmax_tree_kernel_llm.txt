```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads and writes where possible
// Use shared memory if appropriate to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure that threads within a warp execute the same instruction to improve efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches for better performance
// Align data structures to facilitate efficient vectorized loads/stores
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
