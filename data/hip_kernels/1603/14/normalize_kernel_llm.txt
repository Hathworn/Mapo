// Use shared memory to store mean and variance for faster access
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement in mean and variance computation
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Utilize vectorized memory operations to increase data throughput
// Pre-compute reciprocal of variance_f to reduce computational overhead
