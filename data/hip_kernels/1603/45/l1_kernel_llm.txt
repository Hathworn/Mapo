```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to maximize coalescing
// Ensure pred, truth, delta, and error arrays are correctly aligned in memory
// Evaluate using shared memory if n is too large for efficient global memory access
// Potentially use texture memory for read-only data like pred and truth for faster accesses
// Experiment with different block and thread configurations to find optimal performance
