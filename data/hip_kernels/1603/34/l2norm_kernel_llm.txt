```
// Use of shared memory to store intermediate sums reduces global memory access
// Use of __syncthreads() ensures all threads have completed computation before reduction
// Reduction step within a block minimizes the amount of data transferred to global memory
// Consider memory coalescing when accessing x and dx to optimize global memory bandwidth
// After reduction, ensure memory access pattern for x and dx remains coalesced
