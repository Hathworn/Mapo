```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring X array is coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse occurs within blocks to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that INCX value allows for coalesced access if possible
// Use appropriate block size to maximize memory throughput and occupancy
