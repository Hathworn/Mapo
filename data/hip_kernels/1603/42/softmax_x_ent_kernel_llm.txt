```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Minimize divergent branches and ensure threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within the block
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory transaction efficiency
```
