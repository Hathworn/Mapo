// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.  
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring thread indices access consecutive memory locations.  
// Optimize INCX handling to avoid unnecessary multiplications in the thread loop.  
// Check for warp divergence caused by the conditional statement and refactor if possible.
