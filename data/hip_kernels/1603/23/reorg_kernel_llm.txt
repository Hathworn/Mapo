```
// Consider memory coalescing by aligning data accesses within threads in a warp
// Minimize redundant calculations by storing frequently used values in local variables
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access for repeated data within a block
// Strive for optimal block size to maximize occupancy without causing register or shared memory spillover
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ keyword to give the compiler more information for potential optimizations
