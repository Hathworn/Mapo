// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring INCX is 1 for continuous data
// Minimize divergence by ensuring warp threads handle similar control paths
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory transactions
// Evaluate increasing block size to find the optimal kernel configuration for your hardware
