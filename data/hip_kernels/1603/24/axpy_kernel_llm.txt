```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible.
// Use float4 for vectorized memory accesses to X and Y for better performance.
// Align data structures to ensure optimal memory alignment.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
