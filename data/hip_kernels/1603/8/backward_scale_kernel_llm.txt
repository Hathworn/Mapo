```
// Unroll loops to improve parallel performance and reduce loop overhead
// Ensure coalesced accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize thread divergence for better warp execution efficiency
// Avoid frequent synchronization by optimizing the reduction process
// Consider using float4 operations when possible for improved throughput
