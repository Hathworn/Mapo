// Recommend using shared memory to store input data for faster access.
// Utilize memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a warp-aligned manner.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Consider loop unrolling for the size loop to improve branch prediction.
