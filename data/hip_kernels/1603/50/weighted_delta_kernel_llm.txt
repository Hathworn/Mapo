```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize repeated global memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling if applicable, to increase parallel processing
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns
// Minimize the use of conditional statements inside the kernel
