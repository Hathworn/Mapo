```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous threads for sequential data elements
// Optimize data reuse in shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Assess occupancy and adjust block size to maximize the number of active warps
// Minimize divergence by ensuring control flow is consistent across threads
// Consider loop unrolling for performance gains in the stride loop
// Profile and fine-tune grid and block dimensions for the specific problem size
