// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access for X and Y arrays
// Consider using loop unrolling within the global kernel function for better performance
// Evaluate if employing vectorized data types such as float4 improves throughput
// Reduce if-else branching by utilizing branch-free programming techniques, e.g., ternary operators
