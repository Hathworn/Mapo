```c
// Ensure memory access coalescing by appropriately aligning data
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize global memory transactions
// Evaluate using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Monitor memory bandwidth usage to avoid potential bottlenecks
```
