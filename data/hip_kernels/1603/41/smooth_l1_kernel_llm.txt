```cpp
// Coalesce memory access for pred, truth, delta, and error to improve memory bandwidth.
// Ensure alignment of data to improve performance and prevent unaligned accesses.
// Use shared memory if possible to store intermediate values locally within the block.
// Consider using double buffering to overlap computation and memory loads.
// Optimize grid and block sizes to achieve maximum occupancy.
