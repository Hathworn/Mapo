```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency.
// Reduce branching by consolidating logic where applicable.
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed but unchanging values.
// Optimize random access by ensuring coalesced memory access pattern.
// Minimize divergence by organizing threads to execute similar paths.
