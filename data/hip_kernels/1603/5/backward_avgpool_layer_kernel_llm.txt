// Use shared memory to store a portion of in_delta if the block size is much smaller than the overall data
// Unroll the loop to minimize control overhead and improve instruction throughput
// Ensure the memory access pattern is coalesced for in_delta to maximize memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider using atomic operations if in_delta needs to be updated concurrently by multiple threads
