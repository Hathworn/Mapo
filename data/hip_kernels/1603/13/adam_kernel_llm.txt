```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for B1_t_pow and B2_t_pow
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to further reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider aligning data structures for optimal memory access
// Minimize divergence in conditionals by optimizing the if-condition
```
