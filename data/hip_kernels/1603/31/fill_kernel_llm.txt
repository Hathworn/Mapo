// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize divergent warps by ensuring conditional statements are minimized inside the loop
// Utilize shared memory if needed for frequently accessed data
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by choosing an appropriate block size
// Consider prefetching data to reduce load latency
