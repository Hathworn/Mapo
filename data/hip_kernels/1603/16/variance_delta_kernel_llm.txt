```
// Use shared memory for reduction to minimize global memory access
// Consider asynchronous memory copy to mitigate latency
// Utilize warp-level parallelism for reduction operations
// Optimize block and thread configuration to improve warp occupancy
// Preload variance and mean values into registers to reduce redundant global memory accesses
