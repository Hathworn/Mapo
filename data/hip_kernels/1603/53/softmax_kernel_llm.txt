```
// Avoid uncoalesced memory access in softmax_device
// Ensure input and output arrays are aligned for optimal memory access
// Use shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory reads
// Precompute constant stride indices to reduce arithmetic overhead
// Minimize divergent branching by organizing data for coalesced access
```
