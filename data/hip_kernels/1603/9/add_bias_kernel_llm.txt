// Ensure memory access is coalesced by accessing contiguous memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize index calculations to reduce the use of division operations.
// Verify that the block and grid dimensions are optimized for the hardware architecture.
// Utilize warp-level operations to minimize synchronization overhead whenever possible.
// Evaluate if using atomic operations could improve performance in specific scenarios.
