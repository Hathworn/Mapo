```
// Use __restrict__ for delta and mean_delta pointers to improve memory access optimization
// Utilize atomic operations to update shared memory to avoid race conditions
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to optimize the accumulation in local memory
// Leverage warp shuffle operations for reduction within thread block to enhance performance
