```
// Utilize shared memory to cache mask data and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory alignment for x and mask for coalesced access
// Explore using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to assume non-aliasing
// Assess occupancy and adjust grid/block size for optimal performance
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead in the for loop
