```
// Use shared memory for arrays a and b to reduce global memory reads
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores for improved memory throughput
// Check for memory alignment to enhance access efficiency
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Assess occupancy and adjust block size to maximize GPU resource usage
