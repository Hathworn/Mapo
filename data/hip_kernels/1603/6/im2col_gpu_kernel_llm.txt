```
// Consider using shared memory to store input blocks for faster access and reducing global memory access latency
// Use warp shuffle operations for data exchange within a block to efficiently utilize on-chip resources
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access for both reads and writes
// Implement loop unrolling within nested loops to minimize loop overhead and increase computational throughput
// Profile memory use and strive to minimize register and shared memory use for better occupancy and efficiency
