```
// Pre-calculate multipliers to reduce repeated multiplication
// Consider using shared memory for data that is frequently accessed by multiple threads
// Optimize memory access to coalesce global memory reads and writes
// Limit the use of atomic operations to improve parallel execution
// Use loop unrolling to optimize the loop performance
