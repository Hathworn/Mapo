```
// Reduce memory access latency by caching frequently accessed values
// Simplify conditional operations to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Ensure that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Utilize shared memory if high data reuse within the block is possible
// Prefetch data if future memory access patterns are predictable
