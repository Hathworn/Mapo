// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory for frequent data access to reduce global memory latency
// Consider using warp-level operations to minimize divergence and improve efficiency
// Balance the utilization of vector and scalar registers for optimal performance
