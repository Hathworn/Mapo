// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access latency
// Check for memory access patterns that may benefit from coalescing
// Ensure accuracy pointer is aligned for better memory access速度
// Use reduction techniques or loop unrolling for efficiency improvement if applicable
