```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by accessing contiguous memory locations.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if patterns are suitable.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Prefer __ldg() for read-only data to utilize texture cache if supported.
// Apply loop unrolling in compute-intensive operations if applicable.
// Balance the workload to prevent serialization on warp execution.
// Use memory prefetching techniques where applicable to hide latency.
