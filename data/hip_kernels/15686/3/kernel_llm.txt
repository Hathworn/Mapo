// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by organizing threads in a way that minimizes bank conflicts.
// Use cooperative load/store operations to efficiently utilize shared memory and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to maximize throughput and minimize latency.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization to reduce overhead compared to __syncthreads() when appropriate.
