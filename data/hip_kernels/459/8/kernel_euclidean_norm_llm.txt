```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by using a stride pattern in accessing elements
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve speed
// Consider warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for more efficient reduction
// Verify that allocations and memory usage are optimized to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Ensure that the number of threads matches the data size for efficient execution
