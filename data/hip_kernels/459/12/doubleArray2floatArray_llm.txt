// Use coalesced memory access for better data transfer efficiency.
// Ensure the memory is aligned for optimal access.
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Minimize warp divergence for improved execution efficiency.
// Analyze the memory access pattern to avoid bank conflicts.
