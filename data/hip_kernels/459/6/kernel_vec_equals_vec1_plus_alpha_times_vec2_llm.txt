```
// Consider using shared memory for vec1 and vec2 to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring vec1, vec2, and vec are accessed in a contiguous manner
// Use restrict keyword for pointers if applicable to aid the compiler in optimization
// Check if prefetching data for vec1 and vec2 can reduce memory latency
// Analyze if loop unrolling can optimize computations for critical length sizes
// Evaluate if using constant memory for frequently accessed constants can benefit performance
