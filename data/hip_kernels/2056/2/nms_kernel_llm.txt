```
// Consider using shared memory for boxes to reduce global memory access latency.
// Try to coalesce global memory accesses for indices and scores arrays.
// Ensure aligned memory access patterns to optimize global memory transactions.
// Minimize divergence by restructuring conditional statements inside the loop.
// Consider preloading frequently accessed data into registers.
