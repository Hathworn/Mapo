```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Employ warp-level primitives where possible to reduce sync overhead
// Ensure memory access coalescing by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider adjusting block size to match warp size to minimize thread divergence
// Leverage shuffle operations for warp reduction to improve efficiency
// Optimize data reuse patterns within shared memory to reduce latency
