```
// Utilize shared memory to store weights and reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure thread synchronization after loading data into shared memory.
// Consider adjusting shared memory size based on the `cols` to avoid excess usage.
// Apply loop unrolling for potential performance improvement, depending on the `cols` size.
// Analyze memory access patterns to improve coalesced memory access.
// Evaluate use of warp-level primitives for further optimization.
