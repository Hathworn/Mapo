// Consider coalescing memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overheads with shared memory
// Explore using atomic operations for reductions if applicable to reduce synchronization
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned and minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
