```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for faster access if data is reused
// Ensure enough blocks are launched to keep the GPU fully occupied
// Utilize memory alignment for better access patterns
// Minimize divergent branching by structuring code to avoid warp divergence
