```
// Use shared memory to accumulate partial sums and reduce global memory transactions
// Apply parallel reduction to improve the efficiency of summing operations
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure coalesced access during _WgradTmp loading
// Reduce the frequency of synchronizations by using fewer __syncthreads()
