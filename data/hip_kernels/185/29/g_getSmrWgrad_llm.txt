```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., weight) to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Optimize the memory access pattern to ensure coalesced memory accesses for wgrad and weight.
// Verify whether the memory access pattern is causing bank conflicts, and apply padding if necessary.
// If possible, use warp-level primitives to reduce divergent threads and improve efficiency.
