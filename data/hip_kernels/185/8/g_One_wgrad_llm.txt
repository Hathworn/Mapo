```c
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to allow compiler optimizations.
// Ensure inputs, curDelta, and wgradTmp are aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
// Coalesce memory accesses for inputs, curDelta, and wgradTmp by ensuring contiguous thread ID access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to enhance performance.
