// Consider coalesced memory access for wgrad and w to enhance memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to reduce latency.
// Explore shared memory usage if there are redundant global memory reads.
// Investigate if loop unrolling can improve performance due to predictable and repeated access patterns.
// Verify that lambda impacts are correctly leveraged to minimize conditional branches within loops.
