```
// Unroll the loop for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and overall performance
// Use a warp-aligned loop iteration pattern to reduce divergence
// Minimize redundant calculations within the loop to enhance efficiency
