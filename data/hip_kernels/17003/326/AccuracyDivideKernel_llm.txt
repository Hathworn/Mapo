// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Avoid repeated division within atomicAdd by storing the quotient in a register
// Minimize access to global memory by using local variables
// Explore memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Verify if precision level (float) is appropriate for accuracy calculations
