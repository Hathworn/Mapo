// Consider coalesced memory access for gradOutput_data in inner loops.
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for reuse in subsequent calculations.
// Minimize thread divergence in inner loops for better performance.
// Investigate using a more optimal thread block and grid size configuration.
// Evaluate the possibility of using vectorized data types for gradOutput_data access.
// Reduce redundant calculations by pre-computing invariant expressions outside loops.
