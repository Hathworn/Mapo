```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Leverage coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for reducing instruction overhead
// Explore using warp-level primitives to enhance parallel execution efficiency
// Apply memory prefetching where suitable to further reduce latency
