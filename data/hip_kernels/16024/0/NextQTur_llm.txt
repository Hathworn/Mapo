```
// Consider coalescing data access to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that data being accessed is already in cache to improve performance.
// Use shared memory to minimize repeated global memory accesses by multiple threads.
// Optimize stride access pattern to avoid redundant loads/stores.
// Group similar operations to maximize instruction-level parallelism.
