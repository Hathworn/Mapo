```cpp
// Consider reducing the number of __syncthreads() to improve performance.
// Merge successive __syncthreads() when possible to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for tab to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts.
// Evaluate different block sizes to find an optimal balance between parallelism and memory access efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling for inner loops to decrease loop control overhead.
// Test with various stride sizes to determine their impact on performance and adjust accordingly.
// Use warp shuffle operations for better intra-warp data exchange where applicable.
// Minimize divergence within warps by ensuring uniform control flow where possible.
