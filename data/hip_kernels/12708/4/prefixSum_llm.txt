```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to cache data accessed by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement double buffering for shared memory loads to hide latency
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Align data structures to natural boundaries to ensure efficient memory transactions
// Avoid branch divergence within warp by restructuring conditional logic
// Consider using faster math operations or intrinsic functions if applicable
