```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to input_T, output_T, prefix_T, and prefix_helper_T to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as prefix_T and prefix_helper_T to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize control flow by minimizing the branching within the kernel, particularly the if-else statements for newpos calculation.
// Align access patterns to ensure memory accesses fall on aligned boundaries, thereby reducing potential warp divergence.
// Use loop unrolling strategies to reduce overhead in the for-loop and increase instructions throughput.
