```
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for better memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory synchronization to avoid race conditions
// Minimize redundant calculations by determining sorting direction once
// Optimize loop unrolling for increased instruction level parallelism
