```
// Use shared memory for the matrix coefficients to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize the use of global memory by accessing per-block shared memory instead
// Store input pixel value in a register to minimize repeated global memory accesses
// Consider using warp-centric programming to better utilize memory bandwidth
