// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access for both input and output arrays.
// Ensure data alignment for both input and output to improve memory access speed.
// Investigate the use of texture memory for read-only data to potentially improve caching.
