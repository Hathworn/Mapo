```
// Consider using shared memory to store tiles of input data for faster access.
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Experiment with different block size configurations for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Minimize divergent branches; use conditional expressions to check bounds efficiently.
