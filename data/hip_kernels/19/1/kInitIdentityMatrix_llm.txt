```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy
// Use loop unrolling to optimize the diagonal check
// Validate the choice of block size for different GPU architectures
// Analyze and minimize any potential bank conflicts in shared memory
