// Consider using shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for minimizing repeated global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning gradInput_data and gradOutput_data accesses to warp boundaries.
// Examine bank conflicts in shared memory and resolve them if necessary.
// Leverage asynchronous copies to move data more efficiently between global and shared memory.
// Use texture memory or read-only cache for gradOutput_data to enhance performance.
