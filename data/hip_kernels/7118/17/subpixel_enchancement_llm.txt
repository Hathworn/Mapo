// Ensure coalesced memory access for c2 array to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed values like dim23 to reduce redundant global memory access
// Evaluate using half-precision floating-point operations for the adjustment computation to boost performance without significant loss of accuracy
// Investigate occupancy and adjust thread block size to maximize parallel execution efficiency
