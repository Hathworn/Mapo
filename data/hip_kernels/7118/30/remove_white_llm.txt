```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory if the size allows to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to reduce pointer aliasing overhead
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to enhance performance
// Evaluate the usage of texture memory for read-only data if beneficial
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to a 32-byte boundary to improve performance
```
