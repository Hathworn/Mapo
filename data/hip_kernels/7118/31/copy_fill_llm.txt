```
// Launch kernel with optimal block size for memory coalescing
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to reduce global memory reads
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to improve throughput
// Minimize branch divergence by clamping coordinates outside the conditional checks
// Utilize texture memory for more efficient cached reads if data access is random
