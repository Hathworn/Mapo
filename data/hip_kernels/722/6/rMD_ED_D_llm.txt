```c
// Optimize data loading to shared memory by minimizing divergence in thread execution paths.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for T to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure memory access for S is aligned and coalesced to maximize effective memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for innermost loops to reduce loop overhead and improve pipelining.
// Explore using float4 data type for S and T to maximize throughput on aligned memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous memory prefetching to hide memory latency further.
