```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring variables like T2 align appropriately.
// Use fast math operations if precision allows to reduce computational latency.
// Reduce redundant __syncthreads() calls where possible to lower synchronization overhead.
// Optimize thread block size based on hardware architecture for better occupancy.
// Preload frequently accessed data into registers to decrease memory latency.
// Reuse shared memory across multiple iterations where applicable to save memory bandwidth.
// Avoid branching within warp where possible to improve execution efficiency.
