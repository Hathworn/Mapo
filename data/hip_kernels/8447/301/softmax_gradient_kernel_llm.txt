// Use unrolling to improve memory access coalescing
// Store intermediate results in shared memory for faster access
// Implement an efficient reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Apply loop unrolling to maximize memory throughput
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
