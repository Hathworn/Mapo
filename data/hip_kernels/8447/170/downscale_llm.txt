```
// Consider using shared memory to store gradOutput_data for faster access
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements
// Make use of loop unrolling further if applicable to increase instruction level parallelism
// Try minimizing global memory accesses by calculating translate_idx_inv only once if possible
