```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved performance
// Minimize divergence by organizing threads with similar execution paths
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if applicable
// Consider memory alignment to improve access efficiency
// Optimize warp utilization to avoid idle threads and increase throughput
// Employ occupancy analysis to maximize thread block execution
```
