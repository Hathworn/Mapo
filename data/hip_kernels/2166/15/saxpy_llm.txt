```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Investigate using vectorized loads/stores for the arrays if supported by the hardware.
// Profile to ensure the compute-to-memory access ratio is appropriate for avoiding memory bottlenecks.
// Double-check memory alignment for potential optimization with hardware-based requirements.
