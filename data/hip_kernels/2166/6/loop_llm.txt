```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to decrease loop overhead
// Profile and adjust grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and performance
