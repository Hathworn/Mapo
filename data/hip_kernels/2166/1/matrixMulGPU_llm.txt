```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access for matrices A and B
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Pad tiles with zero where necessary to handle boundary conditions
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by organizing data properly
