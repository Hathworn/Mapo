```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for global memory
// Analyze if shared memory could provide additional performance benefits
// Ensure N is a multiple of the block size to avoid warp divergence
// Explore using pinned memory for potentially faster memory transfers
// Evaluate launching enough blocks to fully occupy the GPU
