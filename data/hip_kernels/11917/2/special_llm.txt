```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory if there is reusable data across threads within the block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable, to reduce control overhead and improve performance.
// Evaluate the use of multiple streams for overlapping computation with data transfer if memory bandwidth is a bottleneck.
// Implement techniques to minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp take the same execution path when possible.
