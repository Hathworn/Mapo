```
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved performance
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable for better utilization of cores
// Ensure proper alignment for memory accesses to reduce latency
// Minimize warp divergence by managing boundary conditions outside the main kernel
