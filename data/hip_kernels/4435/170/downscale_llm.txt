// Consider using __restrict__ pointers for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data to improve memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to cache commonly accessed data within the thread block to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads and writes, ensuring threads access contiguous memory addresses.
// Investigate using texture memory for read-only data to potentially improve memory read throughput.
// Consider implementing asynchronous data transfer techniques like double buffering to overlap computation and data transfer.
