```
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization barriers by limiting operations to threadIdx.x == 0
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results before final division to optimize memory bandwidth
// Ensure that accuracy pointer is properly allocated in global memory for correct access by kernel
// Investigate whether additional precision is required for division operation by using double data type instead of float
