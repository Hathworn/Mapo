```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for gradOutput_data to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory bandwidth utilization
// Explore more loop unrolling or warp-level primitives to enhance parallel execution efficiency
// Align memory access to avoid bank conflicts and improve throughput
```
