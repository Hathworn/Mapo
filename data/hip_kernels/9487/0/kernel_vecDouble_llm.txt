// Combine memory operations to minimize memory transaction
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Avoid divergent branches within the warp
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer dereferencing if applicable
