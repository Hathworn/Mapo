```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved read/write efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring aligned memory access
// Minimize data types to reduce memory bandwidth
// Apply shared memory for frequently accessed data if applicable
// Consider using half precision if precision allows
// Ensure memory access pattern is consistent within warp
// Reduce divergent branches by restructuring conditionals
```
