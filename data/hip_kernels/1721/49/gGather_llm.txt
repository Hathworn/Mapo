```
// Use shared memory to store sparse indices for better memory coalescing
// Ensure __syncthreads is placed correctly to avoid race conditions
// Optimize shared memory size according to the block size for efficient usage
// Minimize divergence by ensuring conditions are well-structured
// Ensure aligned data access for optimal memory throughput
