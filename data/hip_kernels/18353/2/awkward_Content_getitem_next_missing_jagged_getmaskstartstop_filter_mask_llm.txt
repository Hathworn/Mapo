```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring index_in and filtered_index are accessed in a sequential order.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can enhance performance for repetitive operations within the kernel.
// Assess if warp-level primitives could be utilized for better synchronization and data sharing.
