```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to prefixed_mask, to_carry, and outindex arrays.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if data reuse is possible.
// Check alignment and possible utilization of vectorized memory access to improve bandwidth.
// Evaluate thread occupancy and block size to ensure maximum hardware utilization.
