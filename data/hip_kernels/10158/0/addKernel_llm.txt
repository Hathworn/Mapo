```
// Consider coalescing memory access for arrays a, b, and c to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory if repeated access to array elements by multiple threads is required.
// Align the array data structure to 128 bytes if possible to fully utilize memory transactions.
// Explore loop unrolling if this kernel is a critical performance path.
