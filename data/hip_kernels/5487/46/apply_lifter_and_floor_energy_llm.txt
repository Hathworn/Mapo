```
// Use shared memory to store lifter_coeffs for faster access by all threads
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads from features array
// Consider loop unrolling for operations on lifter coefficients to improve performance
// Use warp shuffling or reductions for energy calculations instead of relying solely on threadIdx.x == 0
// Minimize divergent branches to improve execution efficiency by restructuring conditions
