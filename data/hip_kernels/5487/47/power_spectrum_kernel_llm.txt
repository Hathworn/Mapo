```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately.
// Minimize warp divergence by optimizing branch conditions within the thread block.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Evaluate the benefit of using __shfl_xor_sync for inter-thread communication in warp.
