```
// Load col[idy * ldc] once per idy outside of the inner loop to reduce redundant memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access in reading the row array for better performance
// Try padding or aligning data to improve memory access patterns and reduce bank conflicts
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed variables like col_val if it reduces global memory access
