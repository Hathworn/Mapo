```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory for data reuse of A elements to reduce global memory access
// Experiment with loop unrolling to reduce the loop overhead
// Ensure coalesced access of vector x by threads
// Evaluate the balance between registers and shared memory usage
