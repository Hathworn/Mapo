```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory if there are multiple accesses to the same data by different threads to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate the grid and block configuration to ensure the GPU cores are effectively utilized for the given workload.
// Ensure proper alignment and padding of data structures in memory to improve access speed.
