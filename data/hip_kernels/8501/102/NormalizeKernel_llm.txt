```
// Consider using shared memory for normalization_factor to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and coalesced memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by checking data alignment.
// Utilize cache line efficiency by accessing contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize conditional operations inside the kernel for performance improvements.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques if applicable for further optimization.
// Evaluate the use of half-precision if computational accuracy allows.
