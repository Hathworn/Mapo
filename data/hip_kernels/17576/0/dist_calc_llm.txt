```cpp
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to improve cache utilization.
// Try to ensure coalesced global memory access to maximize bandwidth usage.
// Ensure to minimize shared memory bank conflicts in the pre scan section.
// Investigate utilizing warp-level primitives to accelerate prefix sum operations.
// Consider loop unrolling where applicable to enhance instruction throughput.
// Monitor register usage to prevent spilling, which can degrade performance.
// Utilize __syncthreads() judiciously as it may impact warp occupancy negatively.
