```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed form factors, reducing global memory accesses.
// Calculate hydration outside the loop to avoid redundant computation.
// Instead of using global memory for block index, use a local variable to reduce register pressure.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory before proceeding.
// Optimize atomic form factor calculation by using conditional indexing, minimizing branching.
// Distribute work across threads to ensure perfect coalescing and maximize memory throughput.
