```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading WK into shared memory
// Consider using larger block sizes to increase occupancy and hide latency
// Preload vdW into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Reduce index calculations inside loops where possible
// Unroll inner loops to improve instruction throughput
// Optimize shared memory use to prevent bank conflicts
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop to enhance warp execution efficiency
