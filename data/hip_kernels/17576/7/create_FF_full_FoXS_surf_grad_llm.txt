```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Preload necessary data into shared memory to minimize repeated global reads
// Ensure coalesced global memory writes for FF_full to optimize memory bandwidth
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have consistent view of shared memory
// Calculate hydration factor outside atomic loop to avoid redundant computations
// Consider vectorizing surf_grad calculations for improved parallel efficiency
