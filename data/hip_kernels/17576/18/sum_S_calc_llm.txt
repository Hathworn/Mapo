// Use parallel reduction to improve memory access efficiency during summation.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for Aq calculation.
// Reduce synchronization overhead by grouping operations and using shared memory.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for f_ptxc, f_ptyc, and f_ptzc by aligning data access patterns.
