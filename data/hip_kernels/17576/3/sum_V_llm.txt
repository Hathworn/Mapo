```
// Minimize memory access latency by improving coalesced access for V and V_s arrays.
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory access frequency.
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads calls to enhance kernel performance.
// Ensure optimal memory access pattern for the Ele and vdW arrays to prevent serialization.
