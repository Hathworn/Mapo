```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for array 'a' to improve memory throughput
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to the size of operands to maximize access efficiency
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Explore using warp shuffle operations to minimize shared memory usage and reduce latency
