```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Double the blockDim.x for better bandwidth utilization
// Handle edge cases to prevent out of bounds memory access
// Unrolling loops to reduce the overhead of loop control
// Use __syncthreads() for thread synchronization after each step
// Apply warp reduction to further reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure result is stored back to global memory by primary thread
