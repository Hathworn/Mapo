```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize shared memory bank conflicts
// Unroll loops to reduce iteration overhead and improve performance
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
