```
// Ensure alignment of memory access to improve coalescing
// Minimize thread divergence by keeping warp execution paths aligned
// Consider loop unrolling for further performance gain
// Ensure shared memory is used efficiently to avoid bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize threads
// Store result directly to global memory to reduce redundant operations
