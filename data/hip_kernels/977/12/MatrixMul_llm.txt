```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency 
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for improved performance
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() calls for better efficiency
// Prefer to align data structures to avoid unaligned memory access 
// Consider double buffering to overlap data loading and computation 
// Optimize tile size for better occupancy and performance balance
