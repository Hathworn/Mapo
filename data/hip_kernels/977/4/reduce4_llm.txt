// Use coalesced access to global memory for g_idata reads
// Minimize shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts
// Consider using atomic operations for further reduction
// Ensure block size is a power of two for efficient warpReduce
// Leverage instruction-level parallelism within the warpReduce function
