```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider tiling techniques to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Minimize synchronization by organizing the computation efficiently.
// Align data structures to warp size to enhance performance.
