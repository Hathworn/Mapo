```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize loop structure for better memory coalescing.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading to shared memory.
// Unroll loop to exploit instruction-level parallelism.
// Consider increasing tile size if resource utilization permits.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accessing.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading from global memory.
// Reduce the number of intrinsic instructions by loop unrolling.
