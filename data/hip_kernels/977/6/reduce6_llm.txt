```
// Consider optimizing memory access by using shared memory to minimize global memory reads.
// Use double buffering to allow overlapping computation and memory transfers.
// Implement bank conflict avoidance in shared memory for better performance.
// Utilize more effective register utilization to reduce shared memory dependency.
// Adjust block size dynamically based on input data size and hardware capabilities.
