```c
// Consider using shared memory for caching source values to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced access of global memory by aligning data structures optimally.
// Minimize divergence within warps during the random number generation.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to help the compiler's optimization.
