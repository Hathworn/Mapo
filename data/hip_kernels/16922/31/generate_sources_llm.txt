```c
// Use shared memory to store the random states for threads within the same block if applicable
// Align memory access for verts to ensure coalesced memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for verts if possible for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate the block size to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient use of GPU resources
