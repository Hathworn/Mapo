```
// Use shared memory to store partial results and reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory alignment
// Consider additional loop unrolling for further performance gains
// Optimize thread block size for occupancy and performance balance
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and prevent race conditions
