```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Evaluate memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts
// Use vectorized loads/stores for better memory utilization
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce latency in global memory access
