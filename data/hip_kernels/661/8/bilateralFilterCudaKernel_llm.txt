```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and optimize memory access patterns
// Consider using loop unrolling to further optimize performance
// Optimize thread block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing dev_input and dev_output in sequence
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
