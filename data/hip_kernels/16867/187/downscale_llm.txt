// Precompute d1*d2 for avoiding recomputation in inner loops
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Align memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and reduce warp divergence
// Consider using vectorized memory accesses for improved performance
