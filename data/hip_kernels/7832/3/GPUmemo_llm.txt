```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced accesses
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data
// Ensure shared memory usage fits within available limits
// Consider further optimizations for arithmetic operations if applicable
