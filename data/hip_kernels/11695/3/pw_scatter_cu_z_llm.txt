```
// Use shared memory to cache ghatmap values within a block to reduce repetitive global memory access
// Consider using vectorized operations for pwcc to improve memory throughput
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better bandwidth utilization
// Optimize conditional branches to minimize divergence among threads
