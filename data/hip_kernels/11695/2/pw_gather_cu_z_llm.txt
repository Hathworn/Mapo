```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal throughput
// Minimize the recomputation of memory addresses to reduce arithmetic operations
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access overlapping data
// Monitor for bank conflicts if shared memory is used in the future
// Align data allocations to 128-byte boundaries to fully utilize memory bandwidth
