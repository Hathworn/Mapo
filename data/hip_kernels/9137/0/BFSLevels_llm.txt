```
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing by ensuring sequential access patterns to global memory.
// Utilize shared memory effectively by minimizing its usage to reduce block-level synchronization overhead.
// Ensure alignment and padding for memory structures to avoid potential bank conflicts.
// Aim to minimize divergent code paths within warp execution to improve overall warp efficiency.
// Evaluate the reuse of loaded values from global to shared memory until no longer needed.
// Profile and identify potential hotspots in memory access to balance between shared and global memory usage.
