```cpp
// Consider coalesced access when copying from global to shared memory
// Optimize shared memory usage by adjusting shared memory size based on block size rather than fixed size
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls by ensuring threads within a warp are independent
// Explore loop unrolling for the reduction loop to enhance performance
// Consider using atomics if there's a risk of bank conflicts or overlapping memory writes
