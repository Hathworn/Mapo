```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading `xyz2` data into shared memory.
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.
// Implement boundary checks for loop unrolling to avoid memory access violations.
// Consider adjusting block size and grid dimensions for optimal resource utilization.
