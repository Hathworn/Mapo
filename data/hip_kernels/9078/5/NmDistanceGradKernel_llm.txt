```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for xyz1 and xyz2 arrays to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth if data reuse within block is possible
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring variables stored in shared memory are accessed efficiently
// Minimize the use of atomic operations where possible, as they can serialize operations
// Evaluate the possibility of using vectorized loads/stores for xyz1 and xyz2 to improve performance
