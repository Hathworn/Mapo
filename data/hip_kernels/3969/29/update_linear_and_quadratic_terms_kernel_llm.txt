```cpp
// Load cur_weight into a register to minimize global memory access.
// Use fmaxf for performance to optimize floating-point max operation.
// Combine operations with new_scale to reduce redundant memory access.
// Use blockDim.x and gridDim.x for efficient looping through data.
// Implement atomicAdd for concurrent access to quadratic array to ensure thread safety.
// Update linear only once by checking if idx is 0 to avoid race conditions.
