```
// Use shared memory for efficient memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Align shared memory data to prevent misaligned accesses
// Minimize global memory reads by caching in shared memory
// Consider using float2 data type for coalesced global memory access
// Prefetch data to shared memory before computation loops
