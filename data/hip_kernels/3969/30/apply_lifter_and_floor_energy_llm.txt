// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for lifter coefficients
// Load lifter coefficients into shared memory only by thread 0 to avoid race conditions
// Use shared memory synchronization (syncthreads) to ensure data is available across threads
// Ensure only one thread handles energy flooring to minimize thread divergence
