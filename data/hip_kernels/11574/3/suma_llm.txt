// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for further computation
// Ensure coalesced memory access when writing results to global memory
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure maximum use of GPU resources
// Fuse multiple operations to reduce memory bandwidth demand
// Explore loop unrolling if applicable for increased instruction throughput
