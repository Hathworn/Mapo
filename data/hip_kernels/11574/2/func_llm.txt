```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory latency where possible
// Consider using local memory for variables that are reused within the kernel
// Ensure that the number of blocks and threads maximizes occupancy
// Avoid thread divergence by minimizing branching within the kernel
