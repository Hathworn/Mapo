```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory when loading tiles
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by careful index computation
// Consider use of larger TILE_WIDTH for higher occupancy
// Use loop unrolling to optimize multiply and accumulate steps
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions for the specific GPU architecture
