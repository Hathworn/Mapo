// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'a' and 'x' to improve global memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency by caching 'a[bid * n + tid] * x[tid]'
// Implement parallel reduction to minimize synchronization overhead and enhance computational efficiency
// Consider adjusting block size and grid dimensions to fit specific hardware for maximal occupancy
