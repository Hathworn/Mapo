```cpp
// Load neighbor elements into shared memory for data reuse and reduced global memory accesses
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce latency
// Ensure all threads have loaded their data into shared memory before further computation
// Minimize global memory access by reusing data in shared memory
```
