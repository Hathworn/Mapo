```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consolidate shared arrays to minimize shared memory usage.
// Avoid using __mul24 intrinsic for better portability.
// Use #pragma unroll to assist the compiler with loop unrolling.
// Ensure boundary conditions are handled to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads when necessary.
// Optimize the use of fminf and fmaxf functions to minimize redundant computations.
// Minimize the number of condition checks inside loops.
// Ensure efficient use of memory by avoiding unused shared memory slots.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimized memory bandwidth utilization.
