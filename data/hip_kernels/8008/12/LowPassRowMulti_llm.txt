```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for improved bandwidth utilization.
// Consider double buffering to hide memory latency.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for efficient shared memory operations.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Explore interleaving computation and memory access to increase parallelism.
// Utilize vectorized loads and stores if applicable to reduce memory transactions.
