// Consider using texture memory for g_Data to optimize access patterns.
// Utilize constant memory for gauss array to speed up accesses.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring data coalescing when accessing g_Data.
// Avoid branching as much as possible to increase warp efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling for histogram reduction loops to minimize loop overhead.
// If possible, use warp shuffle operations for reducing histograms instead of shared memory.
