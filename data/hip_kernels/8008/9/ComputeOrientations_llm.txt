```
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to optimize memory access
// Align data accesses to improve coalescing
// Consider using texture memory for g_Data if spatial locality is beneficial
// Reducing shared memory usage by using fewer temporary variables could improve occupancy
// Perform loop unrolling for the loops where beneficial
// Use warp-level operations for reductions to minimize synchronization
