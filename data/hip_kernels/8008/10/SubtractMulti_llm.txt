// Coalesced global memory access can be ensured by keeping pixel data contiguous.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced by aligning data structures.
// Minimize global memory transactions by using shared memory for intermediate computations if applicable.
// Consider using vectorized data types for memory transactions to improve bandwidth utilization.
