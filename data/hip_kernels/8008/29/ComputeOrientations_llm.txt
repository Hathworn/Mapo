// Use shared memory to store pixel data to reduce global memory reads.
// Precompute Gaussian weights and store them in shared memory to avoid repeated calculations.
// Ensure the histogram is initialized to zero using shared memory to reduce memory latency.
// Minimize bounds checking for memory positions by precomputing indices.
// Optimize gradient calculation using hypotf for efficient computation.
// Utilize atan2f and __float2int_rz for fast bin computation of angles.
// Store histogram values into shared memory to optimize memory access patterns.
// Use reduction strategy to minimize the number of threads operating on histogram data.
// Smooth histogram results by leveraging shared memory and reduce memory transactions.
// Maintain synchronization between threads during all stages of histogram updates and smoothing.
// Optimize peak finding by storing results in shared memory and minimizing memory reads.
// Refine orientation calculations using shared memory to reduce repeated access and computation.
