```
// Use coalesced global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Ensure data is aligned for better memory access efficiency
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing use of shared memory
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory for optimal performance
// Reduce synchronization by structuring the code to minimize __syncthreads() usage
// Consider loop unrolling for additional performance improvement
