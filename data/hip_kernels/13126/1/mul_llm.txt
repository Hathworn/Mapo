// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve performance in the dot product calculation.
// Try coalescing global memory accesses for A and B to ensure they are aligned and contiguous.
// Evaluate the impact of loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve execution speed.
