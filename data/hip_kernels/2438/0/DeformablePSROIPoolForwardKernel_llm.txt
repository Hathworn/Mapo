```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Utilize texture memory for reading input data to improve memory throughput.
// Check if loop unrolling can be beneficial in the innermost loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Explore using constant memory for values that do not change during kernel execution, like trans_std.
// Try using cooperative groups for block-wide communication to optimize data sharing and synchronization.
// Verify memory coalescing patterns to ensure efficient memory access and alignment.
// Investigate using vectorized data types (e.g., double2) for efficient memory access.
