```
// Optimize: Use only y-dimension for block index to reduce grid configuration complexity
// Optimize: Process multiple rows per thread to improve memory access pattern
// Optimize: Use atomicAdd after processing all rows to reduce contention
// Optimize: Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if the number of rows processed by each thread is small
// Optimize: Ensure coalesced memory access when reading 'image' data by ensuring x accesses are sequential
