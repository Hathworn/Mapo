// Utilize coalesced memory access for better performance
// Consider increasing the size of the shared memory tile if the GPU supports it
// Ensure that the shared memory size does not exceed the GPU's limit
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to further optimize performance
