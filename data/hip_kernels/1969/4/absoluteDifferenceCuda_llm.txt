```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by having threads access contiguous memory locations
// Avoid shared memory usage unless necessary as it may increase complexity
// Consider using texture or surface memory for repeated read accesses
// Load input elements into registers to reduce global memory access
// Minimize conditional checks within the kernel loop
```
