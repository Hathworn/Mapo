```
// Combine reads into a single transaction when possible to improve memory access patterns.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning data structures appropriately.
// Optimize block size and shape to maximize memory throughput and occupancy.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if data reuse is beneficial.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by organizing data layout smartly.
// Leverage memory prefetching techniques to hide latency if applicable.
