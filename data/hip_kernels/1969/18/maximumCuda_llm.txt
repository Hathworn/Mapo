// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block.
// Coalesce global memory access to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Use loop unrolling techniques, if applicable, inside the conditional statements.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from cached access patterns.
// Use asynchronous copy and operations where possible to overlap computation with data transfer.
