// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for in1 and in2
// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Avoid divergence in conditional operations for improved warp execution efficiency
// Experiment with loop unrolling if applicable to minimize the latency of instruction fetching
