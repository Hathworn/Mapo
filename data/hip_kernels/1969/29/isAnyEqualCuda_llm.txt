```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for the image array to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure shared memory size is enough to hold all data efficiently to avoid memory bank conflicts.
// Consider minimizing the use of atomic operations in favor of warp-aggregated operations for better performance.
// Ensure data is aligned appropriately in memory to optimize load and store operations.
