// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth
// Consider using a more optimal block size for the given hardware
// Minimize the use of shared memory to free up resources for other threads
// Optimize boundary checks to reduce unnecessary calculations
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring threads access different banks
