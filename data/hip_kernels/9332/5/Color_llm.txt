```
// Consider using shared memory to store rawColorMap data for faster access.
// Attempt to optimize rawBinSums accessed in each thread to minimize memory reads.
// Use texture memory for read-only rawColorMap to enhance data locality.
// Perform memory coalescing on rawBinSums for better global memory access efficiency.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques where applicable for performance improvement.
// Evaluate use of __restrict__ pointers to eliminate aliasing and improve access speed.
