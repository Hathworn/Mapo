```c
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring aligned access to rawRingPoints.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions for frequently accessed data if applicable.
// Evaluate the need for __float2int_rn or other rounding modes for different use-cases.
// Consider using atomic operations' performance optimized versions for specific architectures.
// Ensure that the use of printf is relevant only for debugging and not in production.
