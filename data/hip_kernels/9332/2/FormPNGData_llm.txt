```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by reorganizing data in memory.
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses to improve performance.
// Use float-to-uchar conversions in registers to avoid writing intermediate results to memory.
// Ensure blocks fit within the memory access pattern for efficient data retrieval.
