// Use shared memory to cache data between threads and avoid redundant global memory accesses.
// Consider using __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data to optimize global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data and accessing consecutively.
// Investigate loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Optimize divergence by aligning conditional checks and threads executing them.
