// Consider using shared memory to cache gradOutput_data elements used by multiple threads.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads from gradOutput_data.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction level parallelism.
// Assess whether __restrict__ qualifiers can be applied to input pointers for potential optimizations.
// Pre-compute offsets and other indices outside the loop to minimize redundant calculations within loops.
// Employ vectorized loads and stores if possible to take advantage of wide memory access.
