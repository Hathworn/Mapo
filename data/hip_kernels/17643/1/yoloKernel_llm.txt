```c
// Consider reducing bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for reading input data.
// Use smaller atomic operations to avoid contention.
// Consider splitting kernel logic to reduce register pressure.
// Align memory allocations on 4-byte boundaries for better performance.
