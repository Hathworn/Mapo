```
// Use shared memory to accumulate partial dot products for memory efficiency
// Implement unrolled reduction to optimize shared memory access and synchronization overhead
// Utilize volatile keyword to ensure correct reduction when using shared memory among threads
// Use block-wise accumulation to optimize global memory write and reduce contention
