```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to utilize shared memory
// Increase occupancy by tuning block size and grid size
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp execute similar instructions
// Align data accesses to help coalescing and reduce latency
// Reduce index calculations by storing precomputed values
