```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input arrays
// Optimize parallel reduction with shared memory usage
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by aligning data appropriately
// Prefer float4 data type for larger throughput where applicable
// Utilize loop unrolling for additional performance gains
```
