```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for d_lcmMatrix and d_LCMSize.
// Minimize divergent branches in warp by optimizing condition checks.
// Evaluate potential shared memory usage to reduce global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling if iSize or jSize is small and bounded to reduce loop overhead.
// Consider using memory comparison function if applicable to replace the loop comparison.
// Use atomicAdd() carefully to prevent serialization and to optimize histogram updates.
