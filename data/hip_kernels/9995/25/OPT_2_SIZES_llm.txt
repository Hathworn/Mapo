```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to d_adjList and d_sizeAdj
// Consider reducing global memory accesses by storing reused values in registers
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data if beneficial
// Strive for occupancy optimization by choosing optimal block size
