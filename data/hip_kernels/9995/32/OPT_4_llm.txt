```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access patterns.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better throughput.
// Minimize the number of atomic operations where possible.
// Use registers to store frequently accessed variables to reduce latency.
// Check if loop unrolling could improve performance in the main comparison loop.
