```
// Consider improving memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in lcm array
// Use shared memory more efficiently to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure that the value of 'n' allows effective and full usage of the GPU's capacity to enhance performance
// Apply further loop unrolling on the inner loop if possible to minimize loop overhead
// Use warp-synchronous programming techniques to optimize the atomic operations where applicable
