```
// Consider coalesced access patterns for d_adjList and d_sizeAdj to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory if possible for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Ensure memory coalescing for writes to d_lcmMatrix for better throughput.
// Remove __syncthreads() if not necessary, as it can cause performance bottlenecks.
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Minimize control divergence in loops to maintain high warp efficiency.
