```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to improve memory access speed.
// Evaluate using float4 for vectorized memory accesses when dim is large and aligned.
// Check for possible bank conflicts in shared memory access and pad shared memory if necessary.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data properly.
// Experiment with varying blockDim.x to find optimal thread block size for different GPU architectures.
// Consider launching multiple blocks per warp for smaller dim sizes to improve occupation.
