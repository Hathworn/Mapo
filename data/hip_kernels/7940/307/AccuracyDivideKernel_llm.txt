// Consider using shared memory for better performance if the accuracy variable is accessed frequently by multiple threads.  
// Avoid thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a block perform similar operations.  
// Explore the possibility of using atomic operations if multiple threads need to update the accuracy variable concurrently.  
// If accuracy is a global memory variable accessed repeatedly, consider using registers or shared memory as cache.
