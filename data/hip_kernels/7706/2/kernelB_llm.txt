```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure data arrays are aligned to prevent uncoalesced accesses
// Minimize use of global memory by utilizing shared memory if possible
// Consider loop unrolling if it provides performance benefit
// Adjust block size to fully utilize the GPU's computational resources
