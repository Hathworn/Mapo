// Ensure coalesced memory access by using row-major order
// Consider using shared memory for vec if it fits within shared memory limits
// Reduce global memory transactions by combining loads and stores where possible
// Analyze potential use of warp shuffle operations for further optimization
// Explore the possibility of loop unrolling if applicable
