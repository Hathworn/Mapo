```
// Consider aligning memory allocations to improve coalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if data reuse is possible within blocks.
// Optimize block and grid size for maximum occupancy and minimal wasted threads.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to enhance performance.
// Pre-fetch data to registers if possible to reduce latencies.
