```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced global memory access while copying data to shared memory
// Identify if memory bank conflicts occur in shared memory usage
// Optimize block size to fully utilize GPU resources considering shared memory limits
// Consider loop unrolling in the for-loop for potential performance gain
