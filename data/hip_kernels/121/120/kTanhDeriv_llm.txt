```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data linearly in global memory
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need to access the same data
// Optimize divergent branching by ensuring all threads in a warp take the same execution path
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve performance
// Explore using vectorized loads if hardware supports it for further optimization
