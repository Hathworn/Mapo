```c
// Consider using shared memory to store data for frequently accessed elements
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access sequential memory locations
// Investigate using larger tile sizes if computation allows for better warp utilization
// Prefetch data to reduce latency by loading next iteration data early
```
