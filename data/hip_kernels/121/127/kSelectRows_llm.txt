// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Utilize warp-level operations to optimize shared memory usage and synchronization.
// Ensure indices array accesses are aligned for better memory access efficiency.
// Optimize control flow by reducing divergent branches within the warp.
