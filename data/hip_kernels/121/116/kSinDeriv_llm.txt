```
// Consider using shared memory if data accessed by multiple threads can be reused
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access to the arrays
// Evaluate if using texture memory could provide performance benefits for read-only data
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately when modifying shared memory to avoid race conditions
// Ensure kernel launch dimensions efficiently cover the entire dataset without underutilization
