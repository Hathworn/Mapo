```
// Consider unrolling the loop over 'loc_id' for increased ILP
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like 'flip', 'width_offset', and 'height_offset'
// Pre-fetch data into registers before conditional statements to hide memory latency
// Group memory accesses to ensure coalesced access patterns
