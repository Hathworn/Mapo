```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring blocks are divisible by 32
// Consider loop unrolling if len is large enough
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring mat and target are aligned
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy based on hardware architecture
