// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to maximize throughput.
// Evaluate the necessity of mathematical function calls; precompute constants if possible.
// Balance the number of threads and blocks for optimal parallel execution.
