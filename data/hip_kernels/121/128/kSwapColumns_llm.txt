```
// Use shared memory to cache source and target data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for source and target arrays
// Minimize the use of __float2int_rd by precalculating indices outside the loop if possible
// Ensure memory load/store operations are within coalesced bounds for better performance
// Optimize the loop to avoid redundant calculations of column and row indices
