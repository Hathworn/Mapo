```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Try to minimize the calculation within the loop by precomputing constant expressions.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like width_offset and height_offset.
// Ensure memory accesses for 'images' are sequential to leverage coalesced access patterns.
// Consider splitting the work into smaller pieces to leverage higher occupancy and balanced load.
// Minimize the use of __float2int_rn by calculating it outside the loop if the offset does not change.
