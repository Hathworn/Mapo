```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently reused data
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring mat and dest arrays are aligned and accessed consecutively
// Explore using vectorized loads/stores to improve memory throughput
// Assess the grid and block size configuration to fully utilize the GPU's compute capacity
// Experiment with different loop unrolling techniques for additional performance benefits
