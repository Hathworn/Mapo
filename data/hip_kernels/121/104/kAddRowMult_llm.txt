```
// Utilize shared memory to store portions of 'vec' for faster access
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning 'mat' and 'tgtMat' accesses
// Leverage vectorized loads/stores if architecture supports for 'mat', 'vec', and 'tgtMat'
// Ensure 'stride' is optimal to minimize uncoalesced accesses
// Reduce arithmetic operations by pre-computing repeated expressions outside the loop
// Use profiling tools to identify if memory bandwidth is a bottleneck
