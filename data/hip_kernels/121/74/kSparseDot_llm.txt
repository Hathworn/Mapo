```
// Use shared memory to cache dense_data values accessed repeatedly to improve memory efficiency
// Consider using texture memory for dense_data if it enhances memory access patterns
// Prefer use of atomic operations in case of concurrent updates to target array to prevent race conditions
// Optimize thread block size to balance between occupancy and memory coalescing
