```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for loading mat array
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing its size
// Pre-compute indices[i % height] to avoid repeated calculation
// Consider using warp-level primitives for further optimization
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimal for the device
