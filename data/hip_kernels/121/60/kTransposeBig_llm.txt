```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for improved performance.
// Ensure tile dimensions (32x33) to prevent bank conflicts and improve memory coalescing.
// Synchronize threads to ensure all loads to shared memory are complete before proceeding.
// Minimize global memory accesses and efficiently organize the computational pattern.
