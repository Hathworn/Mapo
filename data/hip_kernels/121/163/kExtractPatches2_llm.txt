```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency
// Optimize memory access pattern to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
