```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching for better data throughput
// Optimize memory alignment to ensure coalesced memory accesses
// Ensure that the loop stride covers all data without divergence
// Minimize memory access divergence by ensuring aligned memory patterns
// Utilize warp-shuffle operations to reduce register pressure if applicable
