```
// Consider using shared memory to cache matrix rows for faster access
// Optimize thread block size to improve warp efficiency
// Reduce memory transactions by combining reads and writes if possible
// Leverage hardware-accelerated math functions for potential performance gain
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
