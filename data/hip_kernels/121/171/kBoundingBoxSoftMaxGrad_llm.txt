```
// Boundary check for early exit // Avoid unnecessary processing
// Improve loop efficiency // Use pragma unroll to optimize loop execution
// Consider coalesced access to bbox and label arrays for better memory access patterns // Optimize memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access if applicable //Optimize shared memory usage
// Potential for employing shared memory for bbox and label arrays if they fit into shared memory capacity // Investigate shared memory usage
// Minimize divergent checks in blockIdx calculations for reduced warp divergence // Optimize warp efficiency
