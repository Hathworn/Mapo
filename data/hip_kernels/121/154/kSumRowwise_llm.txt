```c
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns.
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by adjusting block size according to the architecture.
// Minimize shared memory usage to allow for more active warps per multiprocessor.
// Profile and experiment with different loop unrolling factors to find the best performance.
