```
// Use __restrict__ to hint the compiler for better optimization
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalesced memory accesses
// Avoid using __float2int_rn if exact integer conversion is not required
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce latency
// Ensure data is aligned properly for optimal memory transactions
// Minimize divergent branches within the thread to maximize parallel efficiency
