// Consider using shared memory to cache data accessed by multiple threads to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure memory coalescing by checking the access pattern for global memory loads/stores.
// Check if loop unrolling might help in reducing loop overhead and increasing instruction-level parallelism.
