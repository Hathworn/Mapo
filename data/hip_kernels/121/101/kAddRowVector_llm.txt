```
// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of mat and vec to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures appropriately.
// Ensure that the load and store operations are aligned to facilitate faster memory operations.
// Avoid divergent branches within the loop to maintain efficiency across all threads in a warp.
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance performance by minimizing loop overhead.
