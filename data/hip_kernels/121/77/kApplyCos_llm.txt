```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better global memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate values and reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by fine-tuning block size and grid size for this specific kernel.
// Minimize bank conflicts if shared memory is utilized in further optimizations.
// Prefetch data into registers if beneficial for computation-heavy sections.
