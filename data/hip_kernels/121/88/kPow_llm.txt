```cpp
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Ensure data is aligned to avoid uncoalesced access penalties
// Consider using shared memory if there are common repeated calculations
// Minimize the use of powf function for integer powers by using multiplication
// Optimize the number of blocks and threads based on the specific GPU architecture
```
