// Use warp-level primitives to optimize memory access
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data to leverage L1 cache
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved bandwidth utilization
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
