```
// Cache heightMult to prevent recalculating height * num_pix within the loop
// Optimize row and col index calculations to minimize expensive division and modulo operations
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring global memory access patterns are optimal
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if data reuse is high within the block
