```
// Use memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if data reuse exists
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the GPU architecture
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Double-check for optimal use of registers to avoid spilling to local memory
