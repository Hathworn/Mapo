```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for 'a' and 'b'
// Consider larger shared memory allocation to store more elements
// Minimize divergence by ensuring branches are balanced
// Experiment with varying block sizes to optimize performance
// Unroll loops if possible to reduce overhead
// Perform computation in shared memory to minimize global memory access
