```
// Consider coalesced memory access when reading from source and mat arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Evaluate the benefits of loop unrolling within the for loop
// Analyze potential divergence caused by the ternary operator in target assignment
// Utilize __syncthreads() if shared memory is used to ensure data consistency
// Consider using texture or surface memory for frequent read operations
