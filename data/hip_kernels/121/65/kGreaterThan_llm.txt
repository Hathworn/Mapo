```
// Use shared memory to hold portions of mat1 and mat2 to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring mat1, mat2, and target are accessed sequentially
// Optimize thread block size to match the GPU architecture for maximum occupancy
// Use half2 or float4 data types if supported to reduce the number of instructions
