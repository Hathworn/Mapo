```
// Consider using shared memory for kernel sizes that result in excessive loads to reduce global memory accesses
// Use warp divergence carefully to avoid excessive branching which can degrade performance
// For better memory coalescence, ensure consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Potentially improve performance by unrolling loops to reduce loop overhead
```
