```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for tgtMat and mat for better performance.
// Check for possible usage of shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using a more complex memory access pattern if the data is sparse.
// Try loop unrolling if additional computations are needed beyond simple addition.
