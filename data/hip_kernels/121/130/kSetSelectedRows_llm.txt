// Use shared memory to cooperatively load indices to reduce global memory accesses.
// Unroll the loop to increase data locality and reduce loop overhead.
// Use thread synchronization (syncthreads) efficiently to ensure all threads in the block have loaded indices.
// Validate row indices to avoid out-of-bounds memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns by accessing contiguous memory locations where possible.
