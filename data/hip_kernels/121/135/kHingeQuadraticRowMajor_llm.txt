```
// Use shared memory to cache data for the current image to improve memory access performance.
// Use all threads in the block by iterating over width in steps of blockDim.x to maximize data processing.
// Store partial sum in shared memory to utilize faster memory access compared to global memory.
// Ensure all threads have written their partial sums using __syncthreads to maintain data consistency.
// Reduce partial sums within block using shared memory to minimize global memory transactions.
// Update target value only when threadIdx.x is 0 to avoid race conditions and ensure correct results.
