// Use shared memory for reduction if applicable to improve memory access speed
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures
// Optimize block size and grid size for maximum occupancy
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance performance if applicable
// Reuse registers efficiently to minimize latency
