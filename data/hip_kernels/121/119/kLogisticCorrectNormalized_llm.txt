```
// Consider reducing __syncthreads() usage by optimizing data flow
// Ensure shared memory is used efficiently to avoid bank conflicts
// Use vectorized data access if possible for better memory throughput
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can improve performance
// Check occupancy and adjust blockDim.x for better hardware utilization
// Experiment with different shared memory sizes to find optimal configuration
