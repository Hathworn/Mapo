```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize loop unrolling depth to match the GPU architecture for enhanced performance
// Align data structures to ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Check occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes for maximizing GPU resource utilization
