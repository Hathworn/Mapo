```
// Use shared memory to minimize repeated global memory access for variables like bbox, width_offset, and height_offset
// Allocate warp level reduction techniques for efficient computation within blocks
// Utilize texture memory for `indices` to improve cache hit rates and latency for access patterns
// Apply coalesced memory access patterns to optimize grad writes
// Reduce branching by rearranging conditional logic for better warp execution efficiency
