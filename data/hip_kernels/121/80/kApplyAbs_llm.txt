// Use loop unrolling to reduce branch divergence and improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory if access patterns allow, to reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure data alignment to prevent misaligned memory accesses, enhancing cache performance.
// Evaluate the benefits of using texture memory for read-only data to leverage cached access speeds.
