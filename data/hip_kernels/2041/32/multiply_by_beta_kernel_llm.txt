```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory accesses
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data within the thread block
// Analyze if loop unrolling can optimize the multiplication operations
// Use __restrict__ keyword to hint the compiler about non-aliasing pointers
// Ensure that kernel is launched with optimal block size for better occupancy
// Explore warp-level operations to further optimize reduction over beta
