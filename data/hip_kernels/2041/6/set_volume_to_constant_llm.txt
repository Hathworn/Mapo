```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses of each thread in a warp
// Avoid warp divergence by restructuring conditional statements
// Use constant memory for read-only data that does not change during kernel execution
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and device utilization
