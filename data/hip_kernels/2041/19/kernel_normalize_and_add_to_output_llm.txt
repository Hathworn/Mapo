```
// Use shared memory to cache dev_accumulate_weights and dev_accumulate_values to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput
// Evaluate using half-precision math where possible for performance gains
