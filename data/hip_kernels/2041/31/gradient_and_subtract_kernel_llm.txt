```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store input data that is accessed multiple times
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before using shared memory data
// Ensure that shared memory arrays are sized appropriately to avoid bank conflicts
// Reduce redundant global memory accesses by reusing data from shared memory
// Minimize the number of accesses to global memory for improved performance
// Use constant memory for c_Spacing if it remains unchanged to improve access speed
