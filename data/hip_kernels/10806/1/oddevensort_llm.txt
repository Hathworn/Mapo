// Consider reducing the number of __syncthreads() calls to improve performance.
// Use shared memory more effectively by minimizing global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal GPU performance.
// Analyze the possibility of using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could enhance the performance of the sorting algorithm.
// Double-check thread divergence to ensure it is minimized where possible.
