```
// Minimize redundant calculations by caching repeated index computations
// Reduce if-condition checks by optimizing branching logic for memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory operations
// Consider using shared memory for repeated data usage within each block
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if utilized
