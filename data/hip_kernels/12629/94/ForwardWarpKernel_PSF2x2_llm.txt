```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'u' and 'v' arrays.
// Utilize shared memory for 'src' array to reduce global memory traffic.
// Prefetch data into registers for frequently accessed variables.
// Fuse kernel launches when possible to minimize launch overhead.
// Use __ldg() to benefit from read-only cache for constant data like 'time_scale'.
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider reorganizing thread blocks to maximize occupancy.
