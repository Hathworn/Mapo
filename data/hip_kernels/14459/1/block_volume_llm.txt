```
// Use shared memory to cache image_p elements to reduce redundant global memory access
// Coalesce global memory access for image_p to improve memory throughput
// Replace 3-level nested loop with a more compact and performant structure if possible
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed data like srcWidth, srcHeight, srcDepth
// Optimize thread block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and L2 cache utilization
// Pre-compute indices used inside the innermost loop to reduce arithmetic overhead
// Evaluate warp-level primitives or cooperative groups for further optimization
// Use inline functions instead of __device__ for single-line operations like myMAX
