```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning A and C
// Use shared memory if possible to minimize global memory access
// Optimize block size and grid size to maximize occupancy
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for A and C if possible
// Use asynchronous memory transfers to overlap data transfer and computation if applicable
// Investigate warp-level primitives for potential further optimizations
```
