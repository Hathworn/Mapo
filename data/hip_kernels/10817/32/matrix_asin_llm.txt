// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring A and C arrays are accessed linearly.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Assess the occupancy and adjust block size or grid size to maximize it.
// Implement prefetching techniques to optimize data transfer between memory levels.
// Explore the possibility of using texture memory for read-only data to improve cache hit rates.
