// Utilize shared memory for caching to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions to perform sin calculations in parallel.
// Try to minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow same execution path.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access to improve performance.
// Align memory access patterns to the size of memory transactions for efficiency.
