```cpp
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments if applicable to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and load balancing.
// Prefer using warp-level primitives for better performance on computations across threads within a warp.
