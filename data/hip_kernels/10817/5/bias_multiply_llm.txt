// Consider using shared memory for bias if it is frequently accessed to reduce global memory traffic.
// Check for coalesced memory access patterns for the input and ret arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Explore loop unrolling or other compiler optimizations within the kernel to enhance performance.
