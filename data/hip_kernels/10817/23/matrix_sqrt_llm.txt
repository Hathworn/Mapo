// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of A to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth efficiency.
// Investigate whether loop unrolling could improve performance by minimizing thread divergence.
// Check if the kernel launch configuration can be optimized for better occupancy and resource utilization.
