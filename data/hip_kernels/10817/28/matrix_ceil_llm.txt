// Consider coalesced memory access for A and C to reduce global memory latency.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory transactions.
// Minimize branch divergence within the kernel loop for better performance. 
// Optimize the block and grid dimensions to achieve maximum occupancy. 
// Ensure alignment of memory allocations for A and C to improve access efficiency.
