```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing to optimize read/write for ret[index]
// Minimize branch divergence by structuring conditions efficiently
// Increase block size for better occupancy and workload distribution
// Utilize asynchronous memory copies for overlapping data transfer
