```
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Double-check if shared memory size fits within GPU limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure that the block size and grid size are optimized for the specific GPU architecture
// Avoid frequent synchronizations unless absolutely necessary to minimize overhead
