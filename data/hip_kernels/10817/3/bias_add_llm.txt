// Use shared memory for bias accesses to reduce global memory reads  
// Pre-compute frequently accessed values outside of loops  
// Use vectorized data types like double2 for coalesced memory access  
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by proper indexing  
// Explore using warp shuffle for reducing computations within threads  
// Consider using atomic operations if necessary for concurrent writes
