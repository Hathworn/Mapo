```
// Consider using shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure shared memory size matches the block size to avoid unnecessary memory use.
// Optimize memory access patterns, such as coalesced accesses, for improved performance.
// Verify if using a larger shared memory size per block could lead to further optimization.
