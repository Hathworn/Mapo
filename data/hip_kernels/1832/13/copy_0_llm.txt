```
// Consider coalesced memory access for both input and output arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by organizing threads efficiently
// Explore optimal block and grid size for specific GPU architecture
// Prefetch data using registers to reduce memory latency
