```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load data in chunks to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have written to shared memory before proceeding
// Reduce the number of global memory writes by optimizing usage of shared memory
// Ensure proper alignment in memory accesses for better performance
