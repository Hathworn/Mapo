```
// Ensure that shared memory accesses are correctly aligned for optimal performance.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve throughput.
// Use double buffering to overlap computation and memory transfer for higher efficiency.
// Adjust block size to maximize occupancy and balance between shared memory usage and register usage.
