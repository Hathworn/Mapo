```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input, bias, and ret arrays.
// Check if shared memory can optimize access patterns for bias array.
// Evaluate using texture memory for input or bias if access patterns benefit.
// Investigate data locality to minimize cache misses and access latencies.
// Reduce register pressure by optimizing index calculations.
