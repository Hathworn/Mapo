// Load A[index] into a register to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for efficient GPU utilization
// Use asynchronous copy techniques to overlap computation and data transfer
// Minimize use of atomic operations to prevent serialization bottlenecks
// Balance workload effectively across all streaming multiprocessors for better performance
