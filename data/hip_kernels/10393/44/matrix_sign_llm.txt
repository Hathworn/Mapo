```
// Consider using the __restrict__ keyword to enable the compiler to optimize memory access. 
// Ensure that A and C pointers are aligned to improve coalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory if there are opportunities to reuse data within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Adjust block and grid size for better occupancy and memory throughput.
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for further performance optimization.
