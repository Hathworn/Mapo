```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when loading input data into shared memory
// Optimize block size to better match hardware capabilities for increased performance
// Minimize use of shared memory per block to allow more blocks to be resident on the SM
// Use appropriate synchronization to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory before computation
// Evaluate usage of __restrict__ qualifiers to aid compiler optimizations in memory access
// Experiment with vectorized types to potentially increase memory throughput
