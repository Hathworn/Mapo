```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses for better performance
// Align data to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory
// Minimize data transfer between host and device
// Optimize block size to fully utilize GPU hardware
// Use asynchronous memory transfers if possible
```
