```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for A and C to improve performance.
// Ensure that A and C arrays are aligned in memory to enable vectorized loads.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring each thread executes the same number of instructions.
// Optimize the block size for maximum occupancy on the GPU hardware.
