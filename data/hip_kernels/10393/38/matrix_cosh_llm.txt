// Consider using shared memory where possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in aligned and sequential order.
// Explore using vectorized loads to further improve memory throughput.
// Assess if texture memory could be applied for read-only data for faster access.
