```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive elements in memory.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access where possible.
// Ensure that stride-1 access pattern is followed for efficient memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are suitable for the target GPU architecture to maximize occupancy.
// Use compile-time constants where possible to allow the compiler to optimize memory access patterns.
