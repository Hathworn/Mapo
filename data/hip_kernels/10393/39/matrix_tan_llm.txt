```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations
// Check bank conflicts in shared memory and adjust the stride if needed
// Ensure enough occupancy for latency hiding by tuning block size
// Utilize vectorized operations if possible for memory-bound operations
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the loop overhead
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
