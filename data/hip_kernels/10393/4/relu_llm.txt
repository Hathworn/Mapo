```
// Ensure memory coalescing by using continuous memory reads for A and ret
// Consider shared memory usage for frequently accessed data within block
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
// Use warp-level operations to reduce branching overhead
// Minimize the use of global memory access by utilizing registers effectively
// Profile and balance workload across threads to prevent idle threads
