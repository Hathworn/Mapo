// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access for `bias` array.
// Reorganize data access patterns to improve memory coalescing.
// Launch kernel with optimal block and grid dimensions for your specific workload.
// Ensure memory alignment for `input`, `bias`, and `ret` arrays to enhance performance.
