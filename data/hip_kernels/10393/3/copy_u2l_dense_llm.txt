// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance
// Exploit data locality by keeping frequently accessed data in registers
// Allocate memory in batches to reduce memory allocation overhead
