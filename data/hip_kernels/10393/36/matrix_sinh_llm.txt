// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data layout for better performance.
// Explore loop unrolling if applicable to enhance instruction level parallelism.
// Evaluate the potential use of registers for frequently reused variables to minimize memory latency.
