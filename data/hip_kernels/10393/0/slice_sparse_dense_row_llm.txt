```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning thread indices with data layout
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Apply loop unrolling for the inner loop to increase instruction throughput
// Ensure memory operations are aligned and avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Utilize warp-level primitives to efficiently manage divergent threads
// Consider prefetching data into registers to hide memory latency
