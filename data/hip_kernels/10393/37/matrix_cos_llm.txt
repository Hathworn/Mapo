```
// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring A and C are accessed sequentially if possible.
// Use shared memory to store data that is reused by multiple threads to minimize global memory accesses.
// Explore using vectorized memory loads and stores if memory access patterns allow.
// Ensure the kernel launch configuration (block size and grid size) is optimized for the target GPU architecture.
// Check memory alignment to improve access times and consider padding if necessary.
