```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory with sequential threads.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized memory load/store operations if applicable.
// Optimize the use of registers by reducing redundant calculations within the kernel.
// Align data structures where possible to facilitate aligned memory access.
