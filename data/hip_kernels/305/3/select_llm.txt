```
// Use shared memory for increased performance
// Use conditional operator to reduce branch divergence
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared_db[]
// Synchronize threads to ensure all threads have completed before proceeding
// Iterate height reduces multiple accesses and operations
// Store result in shared memory to limit global writes
