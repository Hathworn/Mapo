```cpp
// Consider using shared memory if there is data reuse within the block
// Initialize shared memory for operations if needed in future optimizations
// Check coalesced memory access for better performance
// Avoid branch divergence by minimizing conditional instructions
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced
// Use __syncthreads() for synchronization if shared memory is utilized later
```
