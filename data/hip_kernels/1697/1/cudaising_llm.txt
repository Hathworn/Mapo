// Consider optimizing tempG shared memory access for better coalesced reads.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses towards optimal coalescing.
// Reuse shared memory across multiple workperthread iterations if possible.
// Minimize redundant calculations by reorganizing computation blocks.
// Consider using texture cache for w if read-only.
