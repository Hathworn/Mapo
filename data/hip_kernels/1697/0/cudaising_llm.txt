```
// Use shared memory to cache weight matrix w for reduced global memory access latency
// Leverage shared memory synchronization to ensure w is fully loaded before access
// Pre-compute wIndex to minimize repeated computation inside nested loops
// Pre-compute gIndex to enhance index calculation efficiency
// Minimize conditional checks by simplifying comparison logic
