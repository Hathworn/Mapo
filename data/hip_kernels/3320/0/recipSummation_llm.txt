```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if data and recip have spatial locality.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve memory throughput.
// Explore using vectorized data types (e.g., float2, double2) for loading and storing consecutive data elements.
// Investigate optimizing the grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and performance.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling techniques could be applied to improve performance for this specific workload.
