```c
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring thread indices map to contiguous memory locations
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access nearby input data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance throughput if applicable
// Investigate using warp-wide operations to further optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure optimal block size is chosen to fully utilize GPU resources, considering occupancy and memory bandwidth
```
