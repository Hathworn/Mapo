```
// Load shared memory in a single read to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads to ensure correct synchronization of shared memory
// Utilize register variables to hold reused values, reducing memory latency
// Minimize compute-to-memory access ratio by leveraging shared memory
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Optimize loop unrolling if possible to increase instruction level parallelism
