```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize warp divergence by using uniform control flow within warps.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to increase throughput.
// Optimize usage of registers by minimizing the number of temporary variables.
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency.
