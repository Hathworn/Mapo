```
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory if applicable.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance.
// Optimize index calculations to avoid repeated operations within the loop.
// Consider warp divergence and strive to eliminate it for better warp-level efficiency.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes for optimal resource utilization.
