```
// Use shared memory to cache data for repeated access within a block if applicable
// Adjust block size to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient use of GPU resources
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead for better performance
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to exploit cache
// Ensure aligned memory access for pred and truth arrays for coalesced reads
