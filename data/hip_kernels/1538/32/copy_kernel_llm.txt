```
// Consider using shared memory to store data temporarily if X and Y have shared patterns
// Coalesced memory access: Ensure X and Y are accessed in a coalesced manner for optimal performance
// Minimize the use of global memory by increasing data reuse within shared memory if possible
// Align data structures in memory to improve access speed and efficiency
