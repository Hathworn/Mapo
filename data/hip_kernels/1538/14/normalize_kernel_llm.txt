// Consider adjusting launch parameters to improve memory access patterns.
// Precompute repetitive values outside the loop where possible to minimize computation.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the x array to improve memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory if there are opportunities to reuse variance or mean values across threads in a block.
// Check for underutilization of threads and blocks to maximize parallel efficiency.
