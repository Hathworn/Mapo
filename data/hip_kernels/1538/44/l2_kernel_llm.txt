// Consider coalesced memory access for 'pred' and 'truth' arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce memory access latency if applicable
// Ensure vectors are aligned in memory to maximize efficient access
// Evaluate use of warp-wide operations to minimize latency
// Investigate potential loop unrolling for further optimization
