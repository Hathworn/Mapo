// Simplify 1D indexing computation for better understanding and maintainability
// Calculate stride for grid-stride loop to efficiently cover large arrays
// Use grid-stride loop for better coalescing and efficiency, reducing warp divergence
// Conditional assignment to minimize branching and memory access overhead
