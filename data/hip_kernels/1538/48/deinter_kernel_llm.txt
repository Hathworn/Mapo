```
// Use shared memory to enhance memory access patterns
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed limits by adjusting sharedOUT size
// Consider optimizing shared memory access by minimizing bank conflicts
// Use atomic operations judiciously as they can serialize memory access
// Explore warp-level primitives for potential performance gains
