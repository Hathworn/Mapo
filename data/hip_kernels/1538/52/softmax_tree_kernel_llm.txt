// Use loop unrolling to reduce branch divergence and improve warp efficiency
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for faster access
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and minimize global memory transactions
// Optimize thread and block dimensions to fully utilize the GPU's compute capabilities
