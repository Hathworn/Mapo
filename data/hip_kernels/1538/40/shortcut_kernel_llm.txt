```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing 'add' and 'out' arrays using memory patterns that reduce global memory access latency
// Consider using shared memory when possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Analyze warp divergence to ensure threads within a warp follow similar execution paths for better efficiency
// Evaluate use of larger block sizes, if possible, to increase occupancy
// Utilize constant memory for 's1' and 's2' if they remain unchanged during the kernel execution to optimize memory bandwidth
