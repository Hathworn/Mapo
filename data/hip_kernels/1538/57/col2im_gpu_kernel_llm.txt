```
// Use shared memory to cache data_col for faster access and reduced global memory traffic
// Optimize index calculations by using more efficient integer arithmetic
// Unroll inner loops to improve parallel execution efficiency
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses when reading from data_col
// Balance the workload across threads and thread blocks for better parallel efficiency
// Utilize warp-level primitives to reduce the overhead of atomic operations when updating data_im
