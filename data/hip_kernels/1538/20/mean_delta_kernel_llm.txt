```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access by loading 'variance' into shared memory
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same branches
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory addresses
// Prefetch data to hide memory latency: load data into registers before they are needed
// Reduce memory dependency by using non-blocking memory operations when available
