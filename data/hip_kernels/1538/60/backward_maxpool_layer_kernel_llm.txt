```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to reduce latency
// Optimize grid and block sizes to maximize occupancy
// Avoid branching within loops; use predication if possible
