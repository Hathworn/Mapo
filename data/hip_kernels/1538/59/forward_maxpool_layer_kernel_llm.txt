// Consider pre-fetching data to shared memory for faster access
// Use loop unrolling in the pooling window iteration for better performance
// Minimize index calculations by reusing computed values
// Optimize strided memory accesses by ensuring coalesced memory patterns
// Assess the possibility of using vectorized loads/stores to enhance throughput
