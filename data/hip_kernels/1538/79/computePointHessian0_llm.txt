```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescent global memory access.
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to hide read latencies.
// Minimize redundant computations by reusing computed values as much as possible.
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits to avoid bank conflicts.
