// Use shared memory to cache parts of 'x' for reduced global memory access
// Apply loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead
// Use thread block synchronization to reduce repeated computations
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns
// Double-check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage
