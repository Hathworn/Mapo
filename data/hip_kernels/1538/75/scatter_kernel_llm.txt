// Use shared memory to cache indices, reducing redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize synchronization by ensuring __syncthreads is used after loading shared data
// Evaluate potential benefits of using different execution configurations for improved utilization
// Consider coalescing scattered_feature writes for better memory access patterns
