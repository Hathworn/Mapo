```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses if possible
// Optimize data reuse by loading X[i * INCX] once when possible
// Ensure enough threads per block to fully utilize the GPU's computational resources
// Consider vectorized data access methods to increase throughput
// Ensure INCX is set to 1 where possible for better performance
