```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory load/store operations
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring conditions for coherence
// Consider using float4 or float3 for multiple data fetches at once if applicable
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Optimize memory access patterns for stride-based accesses
```
