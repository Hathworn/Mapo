```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Fuse loop to minimize kernel launch overhead and improve memory access pattern
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for coalesced access
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning loops with warp boundaries
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer arguments to enable better compiler optimizations
