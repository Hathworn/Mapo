```
// Use id and stride efficiently for loop iteration to maximize parallelism.
// Improve loop by calculating transformed coordinates only once.
// Use a more efficient condition check for tmp_ex validity.
// Consider coalescing memory access for point_gradients and cov_dxd_pi arrays.
// Optimize memory access by minimizing the number of reads, especially those dependent on valid_points_num.
