```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data like num_points_at_this_pillar
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory
// Exit early for threads exceeding num_points_at_this_pillar to save resources
// Compute indices outside of memory access loops to minimize calculations
// Align memory accesses to facilitate coalescing
