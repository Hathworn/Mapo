```
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations
// Verify occupancy and consider adjusting block size for better throughput
// Optimize register usage to avoid register spilling and achieve better performance
