```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize atomic operations by accumulating results locally first
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by structuring data access patterns
// Prefer block-level synchronization over global-level synchronization
// Optimize memory bandwidth by minimizing redundant computations
```
