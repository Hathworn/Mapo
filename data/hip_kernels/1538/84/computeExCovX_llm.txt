```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access
// Use loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce loop overhead
// Pre-fetch data to reduce memory latency
// Minimize data transfer between CPU and GPU by retaining computations on the GPU
