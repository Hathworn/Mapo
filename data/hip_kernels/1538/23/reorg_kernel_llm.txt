```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for x and out arrays
// Ensure data alignment for efficient memory transactions
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize global memory traffic
// Minimize bus traffic by optimizing memory access patterns
// Evaluate potential benefits of warp shuffle for data exchange between threads
// Use vectorized loads/stores if supported to improve throughput
