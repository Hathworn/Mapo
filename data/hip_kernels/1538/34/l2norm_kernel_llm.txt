```
// Use shared memory to load data and reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data to registers to hide latency and improve loop performance
// Vectorize operations, consider processing multiple spatial elements per thread
// Merge consecutive memory accesses into larger chunks for coalescing
// Ensure memory alignment and coalesced accesses for x and dx arrays
```
