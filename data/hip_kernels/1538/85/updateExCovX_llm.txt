```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory if there are redundant data accesses within threads
// Check if the mathematical operations can benefit from instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by selecting optimal block and grid sizes
