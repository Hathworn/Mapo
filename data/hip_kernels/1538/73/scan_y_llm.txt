```cpp
// Ensure the use of coalesced global memory access when reading from g_idata.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
// Synchronize threads efficiently to ensure shared memory consistency.
// Implement coalesced writing pattern back to g_odata for improved performance.
// Consider reducing thread divergence within the warp for better efficiency.
