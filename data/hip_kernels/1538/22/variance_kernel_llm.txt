```
// Use shared memory to cache intermediate results and reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory access for optimal memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Ensure memory alignment to exploit coalesced access patterns effectively
```
