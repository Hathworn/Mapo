```
// Use shared memory to temporarily store elements for coalesced access
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory access latency
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy and performance
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if applicable to improve compiler optimizations
// Ensure memory alignment to prevent uncoalesced memory accesses
