// Consider coalesced memory access for dev_pillar_count_histo by reorganizing data layout.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding or aligning data.
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Prefetch data to shared memory before processing in threads.
// Use warp-level primitives to minimize thread divergence in conditional statements.
// Reduce atomic operations by batch processing or using warp-level reductions.
