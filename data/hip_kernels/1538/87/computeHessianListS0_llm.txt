// Consider using shared memory to cache trans_x, trans_y, trans_z for the block to improve memory access efficiency.
// Review strided loop usage and assess if warp divergence impacts performance negatively; structure calculations to minimize divergence.
// Evaluate potential for loop unrolling in the innermost loops for reducing instruction overhead.
// Optimize memory coalescing for accessing trans_x, trans_y, trans_z, and other input arrays, ensuring that accesses are aligned.
// Reduce register pressure by identifying redundant variables or computations and simplifying expressions where possible.
