```
// Consider coalesced memory access for x, y, z arrays for better performance.
// Preload frequently accessed dj_ang data into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure all threads have written to shared memory before usage with __syncthreads().
// Use double buffering technique if applicable to overlap computation and data transfer.
// Adjust block and grid size to maximize occupancy and efficiency on target device.
