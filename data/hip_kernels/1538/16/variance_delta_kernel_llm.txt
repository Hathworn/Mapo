```
// Consider using shared memory for more efficient data reuse
// Coalesce global memory accesses by reordering data layout if possible
// Use loop unrolling to optimize inner loops for better performance
// Ensure that all memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory throughput
// Minimize redundant calculations by precomputing common variables
```
