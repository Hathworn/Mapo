```
// Use shared memory for input and output to enhance data locality
// Optimize the largest element search with warped-level parallel reduction
// Coalesce memory access for input and output arrays for better throughput
// Minimize use of the global memory by storing partial results in shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed configurations such as stride and temp
// Employ occupancy calculator to determine optimal block size
