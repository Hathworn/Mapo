// Consider optimizing memory access patterns with coalesced memory accesses.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory alignment for shared memory allocation to optimize performance.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory reads and writes.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the filter computation for better efficiency.
// Utilize constant memory for repeated constants or small data sets to reduce global memory access.
