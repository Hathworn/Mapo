```cpp
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only memory access to optimize memory operations.
// Align memory accesses to ensure coalesced memory transactions.
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Merge grid and block memory accesses to improve spatial locality.
// Utilize register usage to cache frequently accessed variables.
// Use texture memory for 2D image data to benefit from caching.
