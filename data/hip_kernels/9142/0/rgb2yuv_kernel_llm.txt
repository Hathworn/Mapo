```c
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using texture memory if cache locality is high and data reuse is significant.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to ensure maximum occupancy.
