```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for img_r, img_g, img_b
// Use float3 for coalesced memory access instead of separate R, G, B arrays
// Precompute 1/255.0f for performance improvement
// Consider using half precision if precision can be traded for performance
// Reduce if-statements by computing H value conditionally and using mathematical operations
// Ensure memory stores (img_h, img_s, img_l) are aligned and coalesced
// Use warp-level intrinsics for min/max calculation to improve performance
