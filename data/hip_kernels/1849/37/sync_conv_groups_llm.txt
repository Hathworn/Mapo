```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if needed.
// Analyze if warp synchronization can be utilized for better performance.
// Check if memory access patterns align with bank and cache requirements.
