```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data into shared memory to minimize access time
// Ensure best use of __syncthreads() to manage thread synchronization
// Use local variables for frequently accessed data to decrease register pressure
// Optimize loop to improve computation performance and control flow divergence
// Consider adjusting block and grid size for better occupancy and performance
// Utilize uchar4 type for storing color to align memory access and reduce size
