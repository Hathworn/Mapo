```
// Consider using shared memory for storing the viridis colormap to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes for the ptr array.
// Precalculate values like zoomX, zoomY, re_factor, and im_factor outside of loops to save computation.
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data whenever possible.
// Ensure loop boundaries and conditions minimize unnecessary computations and checks.
