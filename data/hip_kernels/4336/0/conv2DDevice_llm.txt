```cpp
// Consider using textures to load data for better cache performance.
// Optimize boundary conditions to reduce the number of divergent branches.
// Minimize data transfer between global memory and shared memory.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning global memory access patterns.
// Leverage constant memory for static coefficients if kernel weights are constant.
