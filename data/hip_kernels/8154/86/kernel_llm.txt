```
// Consider using coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Minimize shared memory usage where possible to increase occupancy
// Ensure optimal block size (BS) for compute capability of target GPU
// Experiment with different grid sizes to find best balance for workload
// Use appropriate math libraries/functions for numerical operations
