```
// Consider using shared memory to load visibilities and vis_intensity in blocks to reduce global memory access latency.
// Perform coalesced accesses to ensure contiguous memory reads and writes.
// Ensure that grid_pitch is appropriately aligned to allow efficient memory transactions.
// Try loop unrolling for the batch processing loop to improve instruction efficiency.
