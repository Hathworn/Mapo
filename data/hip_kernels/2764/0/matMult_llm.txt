```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache tiles of matrices A and B to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data fetches with warp execution.
// Consider padding BLOCK_SIZE to avoid shared memory bank conflicts.
// Allocate registers for frequently used variables to reduce repeated memory accesses.
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to necessary points to optimize synchronization overhead.
// Optimize loop unrolling for the inner product computation to decrease loop control overhead.
