```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Align data structures for improved memory alignment.
// Ensure __restrict__ qualifiers are used for all pointers to allow for better compiler optimizations.
// Consider using float4 for accels if memory alignment and access patterns allow.
// Reduce branch divergence by ensuring threads within a warp take the same execution path.
