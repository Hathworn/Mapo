```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory if multiple threads need access to common data
// Minimize global memory accesses by loading data into registers
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Use __restrict__ to help the compiler with better optimization
// Consider using float3 for position and velocity if w component is not needed
