```
// Compute global thread index using blockIdx.x and threadIdx.x for better scalability
// Ensure thread index 'i' is within array bounds to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Consider optimizing data access patterns for aligned memory access
// Explore prefetching techniques to reduce latency in accessing a[i] and b[i]
