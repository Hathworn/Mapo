```cpp
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by aligning data structures if necessary
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within the block is significant
// Minimize the kernel grid launch configuration to avoid excessive overhead
// Ensure inputs and outputs are stored in global memory with high bandwidth
```
