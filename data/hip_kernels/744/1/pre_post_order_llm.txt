```
// Consider coalescing memory access for the 'roots', 'leaves', and 'singletons' arrays to improve efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory more effectively by minimizing unnecessary reads/writes to global memory.
// Explore warp shuffle operations for intra-block communication instead of using shared memory.
// Ensure memory alignment for `depth`, `zeta`, and `zeta_tilde` to leverage faster memory transactions.
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by storing frequently used values in registers.
// Avoid repeated calculations for indices in the inner loop by pre-computing outside the loop if possible.
