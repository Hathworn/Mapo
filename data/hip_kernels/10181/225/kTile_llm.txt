```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns.
// Explore coalesced memory access to improve performance.
// Examine potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Consider unrolling loops to enhance performance by reducing overhead.
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations inside the loop for efficiency.
