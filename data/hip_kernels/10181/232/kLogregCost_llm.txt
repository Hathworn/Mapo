```
// Consider coalesced access for the probs and labels arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently-accessed data, such as maxProbs, for faster access.
// Minimize divergence by grouping threads with the same execution paths.
// Examine the possibility of using texture memory for faster access to repeating data.
// Explore loop unrolling within the for-loop to improve performance.
// Consider prefetching data into registers where possible for reducing latency.
