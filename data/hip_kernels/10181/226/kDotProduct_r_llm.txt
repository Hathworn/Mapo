```
// Unroll the loop to minimize loop overhead and increase performance
// Use warp shuffle to reduce __syncthreads() and improve memory access efficiency
// Optimize memory access pattern by using shared memory to accumulate values
// Minimize global memory access by writing results from shared memory to target array
