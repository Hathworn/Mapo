```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for Y, dY, and dX by aligning data structures
// Minimize shared memory usage via parallel reduction to decrease bank conflicts
// Optimize reduction loop by using a single warp loop to limit divergence
// Use __syncthreads() strategically to synchronize results and avoid deadlock
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting thread/block configurations
```
