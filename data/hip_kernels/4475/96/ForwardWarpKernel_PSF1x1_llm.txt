```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed values to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with data layout in global memory
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data when access pattern has spatial locality
// Reduce divergent branching by refactoring conditional logic to improve warp efficiency
// Optimize arithmetic operations by minimizing conversions and using intrinsics when possible
