// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory reads.  
// Employ memory coalescing by ensuring that global memory accesses are contiguous when possible.
// Minimize divergent branches by reordering calculations and conditions if applicable.  
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce access latency if register usage allows.  
// Consider loop unrolling optimizations if applicable for repeated operations.
