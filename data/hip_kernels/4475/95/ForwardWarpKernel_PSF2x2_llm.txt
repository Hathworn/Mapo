```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Perform loop unrolling where applicable to improve computational efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data for efficient data access
// Optimize thread block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize shared memory bank conflicts
