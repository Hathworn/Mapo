```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branching within warp for optimal performance.
// Increase occupancy by optimizing register usage or reducing shared memory footprint.
// Align data structures to warp size to improve coalesced memory access.
// Consider launching with optimal block size and grid configuration for the target device.
