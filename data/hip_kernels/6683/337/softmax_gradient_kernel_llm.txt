```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for Y, dY and dX to optimize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to optimize memory access by providing hints to the compiler about non-aliasing.
// Ensure that shared memory usage is optimized to prevent bank conflicts during reduction.
// Leverage warp shuffling operations for more efficient intra-warp reduction operations.
// Ensure alignment of shared memory to optimize memory access within a warp.
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block for improved computational efficiency, if resources allow.
