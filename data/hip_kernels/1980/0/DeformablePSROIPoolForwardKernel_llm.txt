// Utilize shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointer parameters to assist the compiler in optimization.
// Minimize the usage of floor and ceil functions within the loop to optimize performance.
// Align memory access patterns to improve coalesced memory access behavior.
