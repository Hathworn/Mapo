```
// Consider using shared memory for Ztopo as it's reused across boundary conditions
// Use loop unrolling within the while loop for increased computational efficiency
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns for Hs, K2n, and K2s arrays
// Implement a conditional check outside the stride loop for BC2D to minimize unnecessary computation during each iteration
// Evaluate the potential of using __restrict__ pointers to indicate no aliasing and aid compiler optimization
