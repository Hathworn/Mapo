```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring memory access is aligned
// Optimize memory access by loading data into registers when possible
// Check for possibilities of loop unrolling to improve performance
// Evaluate the use of streams to overlap computation with memory operations
