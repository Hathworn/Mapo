```
// Optimize: Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing Var in a contiguous manner
// Optimize: Utilize shared memory to cache data where possible for repeated access
// Optimize: Minimize redundant calculations within the kernel by pre-calculating indices
// Optimize: Adjust block size for optimal occupancy based on hardware specifics
// Optimize: Consider using warp-level parallelism for fine-grained control
// Optimize: Profile the kernel and look for any possible divergence in warp execution
