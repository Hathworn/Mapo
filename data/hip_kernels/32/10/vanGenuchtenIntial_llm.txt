```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Perform manual loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Optimize the conversion of units and condition checks by minimizing conditional branches.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for efficient utilization of global memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate whether atomic operations or warps could accelerate computation in overlapping memory regions.
// Consider using intrinsic functions for math operations to improve execution speed on the GPU.
