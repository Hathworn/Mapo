```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to dev_nt and dev_nr to improve performance.
// Align memory accesses to improve cache efficiency and reduce divergence.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to buffer dev_nt and dev_nr for repeated accesses by threads in a block.
// Minimize divergent control flow within blocks to optimize warp execution efficiency.
// Consider using texture memory for potentially better caching of random read accesses.
