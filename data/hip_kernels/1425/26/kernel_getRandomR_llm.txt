```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use shared memory for result (res) to minimize redundancy
// Use local variable for sum to avoid shared memory bank conflicts
// Perform scaling operations after matrix multiplication to optimize caching
// Coalesce global memory writes by contiguous thread access for dev_mat
