```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for devnR to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure devnR and devRotm are aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to preload matrix elements more extensively to reduce global memory access.
// Aim for optimal block size to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
// Batch memory write-back to devRotm to reduce global memory transactions.
