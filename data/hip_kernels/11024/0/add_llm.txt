// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to data by multiple threads
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access
// Evaluate the use of registers for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Assess whether the problem can benefit from larger blocks or a different grid configuration
