// Use shared memory for reduced latency by loading vector_in once per block
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() after loading data
// Avoid repeated global memory access by utilizing shared_vector_in
// Adjust shared memory size according to blockDim.x to prevent overflow
// Consider vectorization to improve memory fetch efficiency
