```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Ensure __restrict__ pointers are used to indicate no overlap in pointer references.
// Ensure aligned memory access to benefit from memory transactions.
// Prefer float4 or similar for loading data when elements are contiguous.
// Use warp-level primitives if applicable to reduce global memory transactions.
