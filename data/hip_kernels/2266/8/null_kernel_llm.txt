```
// Ensure data is coalesced for efficient memory access
// Consider adjusting memory access patterns to reduce memory bandwidth
// Utilize shared memory where applicable to reduce global memory accesses
// Use texture memory for read-only data to potentially improve cache hit rate
// Minimize data movement between CPU and GPU to reduce latency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better resource utilization
// Assess if the kernel could benefit from register spilling reduction
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable in other parts of kernel for performance enhancement
