```
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for A and B to optimize memory throughput.
// Check if shared memory can be utilized to temporarily hold data close to the compute units.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling techniques can be applied for better performance.
// Assess if the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the specific GPU architecture.
// Investigate if asynchronous memory operations might yield performance gains in some scenarios.
// Analyze the possibility of using warp-level primitives to further enhance parallel execution efficiency.
