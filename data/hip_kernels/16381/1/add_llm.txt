```
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store commonly accessed data and reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory load/store efficiency.
// Utilize loop unrolling where possible to minimize loop overhead and maximize pipeline utilization.
// If applicable, explore employing vectorized operations to increase arithmetic intensity.
