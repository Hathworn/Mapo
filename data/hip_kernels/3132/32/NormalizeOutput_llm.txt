```
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced by processing contiguous elements with each thread
// Use a larger block size if performance is limited by insufficient parallelism
// Consider using shared memory to cache data if memory bandwidth is a bottleneck
// Minimize divergence by ensuring branches are uniformly executed across threads
