```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for row_sum and col_sum to improve memory throughput
// Evaluate using shared memory to further improve data locality and minimize global memory access latency
// Optimize the block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy and workload balancing
// Minimize the number of arithmetic operations in the loop to enhance performance
