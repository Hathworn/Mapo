```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize memory alignment by ensuring dst and src pointers are aligned.
// Ensure col_src is a multiple of the warp size for better performance.
// Consider prefetching data to registers to hide memory latency.
// Minimize data divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same code path.
