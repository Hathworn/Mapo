// Use shared memory for temporary results to reduce global memory access.
// Calculate global index once to minimize redundant calculations.
// Ensure dim_idx is within bounds to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
// Correct precision errors to avoid inaccuracies in angle calculations.
// Use atomic operations to safely update shared memory in a parallel environment.
// Synchronize threads to ensure all computations on shared memory are complete before accessing global memory.
