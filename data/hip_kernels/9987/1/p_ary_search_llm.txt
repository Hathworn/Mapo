```
// Consider using shared memory for faster access to frequently accessed data
// Minimize synchronization by reorganizing logic to reduce __syncthreads() calls
// Coalesce memory access by aligning consecutive threads to contiguous memory locations
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized to reduce contention
// Consider using streams or other methods to increase concurrency if the problem size is large
