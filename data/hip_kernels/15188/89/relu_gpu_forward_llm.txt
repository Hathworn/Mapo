```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Use __restrict__ keyword to inform the compiler of non-aliasing pointers for possible optimization
// Evaluate launching multiple kernels if N is significantly large to improve resource utilization
// Fine-tune block and grid sizes based on hardware specifics for optimal execution
