```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for A and B matrices
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to increase memory bandwidth utilization
// Unroll the innermost loop to improve instruction throughput and pipelining
// Optimize register usage to avoid bank conflicts and maximize memory bandwidth
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the GPU architecture being used
