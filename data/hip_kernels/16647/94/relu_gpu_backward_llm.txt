```
// Consider using shared memory if ingrad and outgrad data can benefit from reduced global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring data is accessed in a sequential, orderly fashion
// Optimize block and grid sizes to fully utilize GPU resources and minimize the number of idle threads
// Use prefetching techniques if possible to hide memory latency
