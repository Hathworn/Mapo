// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory
// Utilize shared memory if there are frequent read operations
// Evaluate usage of memory prefetching to hide latency
// Ensure data alignment to improve access efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance optimization
// Review grid and block size to achieve optimal occupancy
