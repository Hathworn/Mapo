```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase parallelism
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently utilized and reused
// Align shared memory allocation with warp size to prevent bank conflicts
// Prefetch data to shared memory to minimize waiting time due to memory fetch
```
