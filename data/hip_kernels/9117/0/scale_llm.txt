```
// Ensure that 'a' matrix is coalesced in memory by aligning threads with data access
// Consider using shared memory to store portions of 'a' matrix for faster access
// Minimize the divergence in the loop to ensure that all threads in a warp follow the same control path
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Ensure the input is well-aligned and within bounds to prevent unnecessary memory accesses
// Evaluate if warp-level primitives can be used to optimize data sharing among threads
