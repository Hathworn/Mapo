// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Optimize memory alignment for coalesced access to global memory
// Use occupancy calculator to ensure maximum utilization of available warp slots
// Adjust block size and grid structure based on target architecture for better efficiency
// Minimize divergence in parallel threads by aligning work with thread execution
// Evaluate using atomic operations if reduction values have shared components among threads
