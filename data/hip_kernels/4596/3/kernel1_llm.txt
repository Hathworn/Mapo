```
// Consider aligning data accesses to coalesced memory patterns
// Suggest using shared memory to cache frequently accessed values
// Evaluate using register for temporary variables to reduce load/store operations
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads to avoid race conditions
// Minimize global memory writes; perform calculations in registers first
