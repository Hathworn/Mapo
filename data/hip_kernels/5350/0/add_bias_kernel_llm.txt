```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Consider padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Prefetch data to reduce latency in memory access
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Adjust block and grid size for maximum occupancy
```
