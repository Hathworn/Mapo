```
// Ensure optimal coalesced memory access patterns.
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to maximize data reuse.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if applicable to help the compiler optimize.
// Optimize memory access by using aligned memory if necessary.
// Evaluate the possibility of using memory prefetching techniques.
// Consider loop unrolling in sections where applicable for minor performance gains.
// Review how data is loaded and ensure shared memory is utilized efficiently.
// If constant memory usage by 'c_Kernel' is within limits, check to ensure no bank conflicts.
