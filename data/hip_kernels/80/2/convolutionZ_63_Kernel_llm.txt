```
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase efficiency.
// Optimize the loop boundary conditions to minimize conditional checks.
// Aim to coalesce global memory access for improved bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is correctly placed to synchronize threads.
// Consider further unrolling the inner loop for better parallel execution.
// Evaluate the use of __constant__ memory for constant data to cache efficiently.
// Check if loop unrolling beyond a certain limit yields diminishing returns.
// Avoid excessive __threadfence() unless necessary for memory synchronization.
// Align shared memory accesses to prevent bank conflicts.
// Utilize warp shuffling (if applicable) to reduce shared memory usage.
