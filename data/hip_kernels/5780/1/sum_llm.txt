```
// Consider using shared memory to store input data temporarily to reduce global memory accesses
// Use warp-level operations to optimize reduction and minimize divergence
// Ensure coalesced accesses by aligning memory addresses where possible
// Evaluate if further loop unrolling may improve performance for specific configurations
