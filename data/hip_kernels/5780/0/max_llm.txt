```c
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate max values to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize atomic operations where possible, as they can serialize performance
// Ensure the use of coalesced memory accesses for optimal performance
// Evaluate if reducing printf calls can improve kernel performance
// Use loop unrolling only if it results in tangible performance gains
