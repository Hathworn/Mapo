// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory access coalescing to improve memory throughput
// Avoid divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Use an appropriate block size to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
