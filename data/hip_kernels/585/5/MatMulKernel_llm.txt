```
// Consider using shared memory for tiles of matrix chunks to improve memory access efficiency.
// Load matrix tiles into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the loop overhead and increase computational throughput.
// Ensure all memory reads/writes are coalesced to maximize memory bandwidth usage.
// Check if using the 'restrict' keyword can optimize memory pointer usage.
