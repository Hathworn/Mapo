// Use shared memory to improve memory access efficiency
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction level parallelism
// Minimize divergence by ensuring warp threads follow same execution path
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Reduce global memory accesses by using more registers if possible
