```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in aFourth.
// Evaluate using shared memory if aFourth is accessed multiple times to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory alignment for float accesses for better throughput.
// Opt for __restrict__ keyword on pointers if applicable to aid compiler optimization.
// Analyze opportunity for loop unrolling if more operations per thread will be added.
