```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads read consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate if shared memory can be utilized to further optimize memory access patterns
// Assess whether loop unrolling could be beneficial for performance in scattering operations
// Check if using warp-shuffle operations could reduce memory operations in computing valueReal and valueImag
