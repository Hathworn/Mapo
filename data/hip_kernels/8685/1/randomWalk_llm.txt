```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Initialize hiprand state outside the loop to avoid redundant operations
// Precompute sqrtFactor and driftFactor to reduce calculations in the loop
// Use crossTimeIndex directly without additional calculations for starting index
// Reduce branching by checking thresholds only when necessary
```
