```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring aligned and coalesced access patterns where possible
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequent read/write data to reduce global memory traffic
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling if iterations over fixed size dimensions are present
// Analyze occupancy and divergence to ensure optimal thread usage without excess or idle threads
