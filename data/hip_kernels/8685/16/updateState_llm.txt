```
// Consider memory coalescing for improved access patterns to B array
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to accelerate memory accesses to external array
// Try to reduce shared memory usage if possible by using local variables
// Evaluate use of warp shuffle instructions to reduce __syncthreads overhead
// Consider fine-tuning block and thread dimensions for optimal performance
