```
// Use shared memory to store crossTimes for faster access and to reduce global memory transactions
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing when accessing the results array
// Utilize loop unrolling for the for-loop when calculating path steps to increase instruction throughput
// Evaluate the use of __syncthreads() to ensure memory operations are complete before using data
