// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring aligned access to shared memory
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize throughput
// Consider utilizing warp-level primitives for optimization
// Prefetch data or use double buffering techniques for smoother execution
