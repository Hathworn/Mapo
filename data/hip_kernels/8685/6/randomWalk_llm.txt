```
// Use static shared memory to eliminate redundant initialization
// Initialize the random state in shared memory
// All threads copy static shared state to local
// Loop unrolling for improved performance
// Consider using more registers to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access
// Minimize conditional operations inside the loop to improve warp execution efficiency
