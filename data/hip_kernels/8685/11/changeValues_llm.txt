```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory reads for frequently accessed data
// Use warp-based or block-based operations to maximize parallel efficiency
// Ensure that grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target hardware
```
