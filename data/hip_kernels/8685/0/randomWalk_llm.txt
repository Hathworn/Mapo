```
// Use shared memory to optimize data reuse and reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider employing coalesced memory accesses where possible.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations as they can serialize execution.
// Precise thread synchronization might improve performance in some cases.
// Use a single random number generation object per thread to avoid state conflicts.
