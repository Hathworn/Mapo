```
// Combine input calculation to minimize memory access
// Pre-fetch B[index] outside the if condition to reduce redundant memory access
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Check for coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling or increasing the work per thread for more efficient utilization
