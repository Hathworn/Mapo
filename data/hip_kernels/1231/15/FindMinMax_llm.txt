```
// Use __restrict__ pointers to give compiler more optimization opportunities.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory with sequential thread indices.
// Prefetch data from global to shared memory to hide global memory latency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing the size of shared memory arrays if possible.
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use loop unrolling to maximize arithmetic intensity and parallel compute efficiency.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used correctly to avoid data hazards.
// Consider using half or smaller block size if shared memory usage is high.
