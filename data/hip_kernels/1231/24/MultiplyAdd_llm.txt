```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use memory padding if necessary to align data in global memory
// Ensure all memory allocations and transfers are done asynchronously if possible
// Explore using texture memory for d_Data if beneficial for memory access patterns
