```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory and determine if the size can be optimized.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is correctly placed to avoid race conditions.
// Minimize the use of registers by optimizing variable usage.
// Use warp-level reductions for faster parallel reduction.
// Consider using atomics for global memory writes if possible.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory and restructure if necessary to avoid them.
