```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data to registers where possible to reduce latency further
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures
// Minimize divergent branching for better warp execution efficiency
// Experiment with adjusting block and grid dimensions for your specific GPU architecture
