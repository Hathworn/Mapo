```
// Consider using shared memory to cache 'minmax' values to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the 'ptrs' array to improve memory access efficiency
// Experiment with thread block sizing for improved occupancy depending on the target GPU
// Evaluate potential benefit of using warp-level primitives for 'val' processing
// Analyze overall occupancy and potential memory bandwidth bottlenecks for further improvements
