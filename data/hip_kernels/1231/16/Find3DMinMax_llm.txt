```
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Ensure memory access is aligned to optimize load/store operations.
// Minimize shared memory usage by reducing the size of arrays where possible.
// Optimize data transfer between shared memory and registers to reduce latency.
// Improve warp scheduling by avoiding divergence for higher performance.
// Reduce synchronization overhead by minimizing __syncthreads() calls.
// Explore converting repeated operations to efficient intrinsic functions.
