// Use warp-wide reductions to minimize __syncthreads() overhead.
// Prefetch data into shared memory before computation to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by using block-wide reduction techniques.
// Improve shared memory utilization by carefully structuring data layout.
// Reduce redundant calculations by reusing computed values within thread blocks.
