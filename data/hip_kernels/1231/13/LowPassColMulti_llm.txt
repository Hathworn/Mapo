// Consider using float4 data types for coalesced memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts within shared memory.
// Align shared memory accesses to avoid misaligned memory transactions.
// Ensure kernel accesses are coalesced for improved throughput.
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to avoid unnecessary synchronization points.
