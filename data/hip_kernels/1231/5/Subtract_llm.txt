```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for d_Data1 and d_Data2 by aligning data properly
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate storage to reduce global memory usage
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Implement loop unrolling if processing multiple elements per thread to enhance performance
