```
// Consider combining shared memory arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize pointer arithmetic to manage segments, reducing shared memory operations.
// Apply boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access, improving memory safety.
// Merge similar operations for min and max computation to optimize shared memory bandwidth.
// Perform synchronization carefully to ensure data consistency across threads.
// Utilize efficient shared memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts.
// Implement loop unrolling for performance gains where applicable.
