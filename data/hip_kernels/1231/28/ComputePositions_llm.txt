```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible.
// Reuse data loaded into registers to minimize global memory load operations.
// Precompute index values that are repeated to reduce arithmetic operations.
// Consider using loop unrolling if there's a loop for more optimization.
// Ensure memory coalescing by arranging data access patterns.
// Align data structures for optimal memory access efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency.
