// Consider using vectorized memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use of shared memory to store local data helps reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Optimize memory access patterns to better utilize L2 cache
// Consider loop unrolling for critical sections to reduce loop control overhead
