```
// Use ternary operator to reduce branch divergence
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores to improve memory throughput
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_Data and d_Result
// Explore shared memory bank conflicts and align accesses to reduce them
// Evaluate the use of float4 to load/store four elements at one time
