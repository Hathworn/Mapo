```
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to facilitate compiler optimizations.
// Consider loop unrolling for the step loop to reduce overhead.
// Try to minimize shared memory usage or rearrange shared memory access for better coalescing.
// Evaluate the necessity of GROUP_SIZE constant and consider hardcoding its value if applicable.
// Assess if the use of uint2 for shared memory arrays is optimal for warp access patterns.
