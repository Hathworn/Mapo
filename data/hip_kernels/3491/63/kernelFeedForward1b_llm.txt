```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache activations and weights to reduce global memory reads.
// Analyze memory coalescing to ensure sequential threads access sequential memory locations.
// Evaluate using vectorized loads and stores for activations and weights for better memory throughput.
// Profile memory bandwidth and adjust block and grid dimensions for optimal utilization.
