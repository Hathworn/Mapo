```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for the edgeArrayAux to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory load/stores.
// Prefer atomic operations when updating cost and visited arrays to minimize race conditions.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls if possible to improve kernel performance.
// Ensure optimal use of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
