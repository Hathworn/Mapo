```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory access efficiency.
// Apply double-buffering technique to overlap computation with memory transfers.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve access speed.
// Optimize the use of atomic operations to minimize contention and improve performance.
// Consider restructuring data or using different kernel launch configurations to improve occupancy.
