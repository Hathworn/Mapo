```c
// Consider using 'volatile' keyword for shared memory to avoid redundant loads.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use occupancy calculator to determine the optimal block size for full wavefront utilization.
// Reduce barriers with warp-synchronous programming when data dependencies allow.
// Align data structures to cache line size to improve coalescing of memory accesses.
// Evaluate potential benefit of shared memory bank conflict avoidance.
// Consider using a larger block size for higher throughput if occupancy allows.
// Explore loop unrolling in sections with fixed stride access patterns.
