```
// Unroll loop to increase instruction level parallelism
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Align shared memory array size to power of two for bank conflict avoidance
// Ensure __syncthreads is used after writing to shared memory to avoid race condition
// Move litems declaration closer to its usage to optimize register use
// Minimize redundant writes to global memory to reduce the number of write operations
