```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to reduce transaction overhead.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations as they serialize access and can become a bottleneck.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce accesses to global memory which are more costly.
// Ensure that shared memory is utilized within its capacity to prevent spills to global memory.
// Try to maximize occupancy by configuring the block size and shared memory usage optimally.
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to hide global memory latency.
// Align memory access patterns to prevent unaligned and inefficient memory transactions.
// Investigate the usage of larger memory transactions to improve throughput.
