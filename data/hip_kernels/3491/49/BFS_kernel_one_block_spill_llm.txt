```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Coalesce memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions for communication within a warp to reduce shared memory usage
// Minimize global memory accesses by caching data in registers
// Align data structures to 128 bytes for improved memory coalescence
// Consider launching more blocks to increase occupancy and hide memory latency
// Try using a two-level parallelism scheme (blocks for vertices, threads for edges) to improve load balancing
// Profile the kernel to identify and reduce memory access bottlenecks further
