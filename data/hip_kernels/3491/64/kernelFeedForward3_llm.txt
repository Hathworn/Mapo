```
// Use shared memory to load biases to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider memory coalescing for loading and storing 'zs' and 'activations'
// Ensure blocks are fully utilized to maximize occupancy
// Use __syncthreads() if needed to ensure memory access ordering
// Consider using registers for frequently accessed variables like 'z_val'
