// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Ensure frontier_length is stored in shared memory to prevent repeated global memory access
// Analyze if using __restrict__ qualifiers could be beneficial for pointers
// Assess potential benefits of loop unrolling for further optimization
