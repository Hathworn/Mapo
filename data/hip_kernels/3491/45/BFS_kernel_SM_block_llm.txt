// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for the edge data
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns for frontier and edge arrays
// Consider using warp-level operations to optimize neighbor exploration
// Reduce contention in atomic operations by minimizing concurrent accesses
// Evaluate the use of texture or constant memory for frequently accessed arrays like visited
// Assess loop unrolling or other compiler optimizations for the neighbor exploration loop
