```
// Consider using shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access.
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_sync for better divergence handling and performance.
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve full coalescing for better throughput.
// Review atomic operations usage as they could be a bottleneck in performance.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Utilize vectorized access to keys array if possible for optimized memory bandwidth.
