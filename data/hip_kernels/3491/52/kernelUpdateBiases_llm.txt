```c
// Preload biases and nabla_b into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Increase block size and configure grid size to improve occupancy
// Consider using warp shuffle for nabla_b reduction across threads for better performance
// Ensure data is coalesced during global memory accesses to nabla_b and biases
// Align memory access patterns to fit within a cache line to improve cache utilization
