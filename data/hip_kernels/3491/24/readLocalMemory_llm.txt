```
// Prefetch data from global memory to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use shared memory to cache data for faster access compared to global memory
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by padding or restructuring data layout
// Use loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism and pipeline efficiency
// Avoid modulo operation with bitwise AND for faster performance
