```
// Consider using shared memory for biases to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescence by checking access pattern of biases and zs
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Explore the use of vectorized data types for better memory throughput
// Investigate occupancy to ensure maximum resource utilization
