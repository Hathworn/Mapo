// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like visited and cost to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory accesses when reading from edgeArray and edgeArrayAux to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure atomicAdd operations on frontier_length are minimized to reduce contention.
// Organize data access patterns to maintain write coalescing to frontier2 for efficiency.
