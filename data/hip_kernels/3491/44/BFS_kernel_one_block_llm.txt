```
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize synchronization through atomic operations for updating cost and visited arrays.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider using a warp-based strategy for better memory coalescing and reducing divergence.
// Optimize loop unrolling where applicable to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Explore the use of texture memory or other cache mechanisms to store frequently accessed read-only data.
// Profile the kernel to identify and resolve any bottlenecks due to memory access patterns.
