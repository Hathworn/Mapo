```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to global memory for performance
// Minimize shared memory usage and prioritize registers where applicable
// Reduce atomic operations on global memory to decrease contention
// Leverage warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use efficient synchronization techniques with atomic operations cautiously
// Balance between shared memory usage and register pressure
// Investigate potential for loop unrolling for performance gains
// Avoid divergent branches within warps for better performance
