```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data with warp boundaries.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper access patterns.
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for potential cache benefits when accessing read-only data.
// Minimize usage of __syncthreads by ensuring all threads in a warp execute in lockstep.
