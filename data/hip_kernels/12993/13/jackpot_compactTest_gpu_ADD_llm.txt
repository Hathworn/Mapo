```cpp
// Optimize global memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to promote compiler optimizations
// Use loop unrolling for improved performance if applicable
// Ensure that shared memory usage is minimized and utilized efficiently
