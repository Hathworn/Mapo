// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for vg_a to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring optimal stride access patterns for temp array.
// Exploit loop unrolling in the shared memory reduction loop for better performance.
// Ensure global memory access is coalesced for storing results in d array.
