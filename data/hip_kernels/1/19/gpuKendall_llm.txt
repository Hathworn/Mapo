```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory loads
// Consider aligning data to improve cache performance
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring warp-friendly conditions
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads to improve performance
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure threads per block are a multiple of the warp size to maximize occupancy
