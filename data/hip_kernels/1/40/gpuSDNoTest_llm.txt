```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for vectsA and vectsB to improve memory throughput.
// Load means and numPairs in a coalesced manner to reduce shared memory bank conflicts.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring threadSumsA and threadSumsB do not exceed shared memory per block.
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce thread divergences during sum reduction phase.
// Ensure that the dimension (dim) aligns with the memory access pattern for optimal performance.
