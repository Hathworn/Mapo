```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for vg_a and vg_b
// Use shared memory to cache vg_a and vg_b to minimize global memory access latency
// Evaluate using float4 or float2 to load and process data in larger chunks
// Use appropriate synchronization to ensure data coherency in shared memory
// Aim for increased occupancy by optimizing shared memory usage and register usage
// Ensure that pitch values are optimized for the specific architecture
