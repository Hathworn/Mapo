// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for temp array
// Use thread synchronization (__syncthreads()) to ensure correct results during parallel reduction
// Minimize the use of global memory by using shared memory for intermediate results
// Ensure stride reduction loop efficiently combines results from shared memory
// Write final results to global memory only once computations are complete
