```
// Consider using shared memory to cache commonly accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use constant memory for read-only data that does not change per thread but is accessed frequently.
// Consider aligning data structures in memory for coalesced memory access.
// Explore using asynchronous memory operations for overlapping computation and data transfers.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure proper ordering of shared memory operations if implemented.
