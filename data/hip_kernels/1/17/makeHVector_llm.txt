```
// Optimize memory access by minimizing divergence
// Consider thread coarsening for better memory throughput
// Unroll reduction loop to minimize synchronization overhead
// Avoid using __syncthreads() when unnecessary to reduce latency
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Explore using cooperative groups for better synchronization mechanisms
