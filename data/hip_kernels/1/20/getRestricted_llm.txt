// Consider using shared memory for Q to reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for vectors and matrices to improve efficiency.
// Use block synchronization to avoid data hazards during Gram-Schmidt process.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations for potential parallel reductions.
// Avoid redundant copying by computing invnorm directly during initializations.
