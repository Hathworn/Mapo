```c
// Optimize memory access by using __ldg() for reading vg_a to leverage the cache
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for vg_a to minimize memory transaction overhead
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning shared memory access in temp array
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync() for faster reduction instead of shared memory
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing temporary results only after complete reduction
```
