```cpp
// Use coalesced global memory access by aligning memory accesses to warp boundaries.
// Consider using float4 or float2 for vectorized memory loads if k is a multiple.
// Evaluate reducing shared memory bank conflicts using padding strategy if needed.
// Attempt to eliminate shared memory usage by performing reduction final step using warp-level primitives.
// Consider occupancy optimization by experimenting with different NUM_THREADS values.
