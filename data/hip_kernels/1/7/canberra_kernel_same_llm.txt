```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for better memory access patterns and reduction
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced global memory access
// Reduce memory usage by minimizing the footprint of shared memory arrays
// Avoid divergence in threads by minimizing conditional statements within the loop
// Use atomic operations if needed to prevent race conditions when writing to global memory
