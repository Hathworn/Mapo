```
// Use shared memory to store means and standard deviations for better memory access speed.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading vectsa and vectsb.
// Minimize the number of accesses to global memory by using shared memory for intermediate results.
// Perform loop unrolling for the second reduction loop to improve performance.
