```cpp
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for faster accumulation
// Unroll loops to exploit instruction-level parallelism
// Use warp-level reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Avoid redundant global memory accesses by storing results directly in shared memory
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns wherever possible
```
