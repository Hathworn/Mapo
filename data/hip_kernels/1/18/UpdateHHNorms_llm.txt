// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for dV in cases of repeated access patterns.
// Coalesce memory access patterns to optimize bandwidth usage.
// Implement loop unrolling within the kernel to enhance computational efficiency.
// Ensure the grid and block configuration are optimized for the target GPU architecture.
