```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory coalescing
// Ensure efficient thread synchronization for accurate reduction operations
// Optimize reduction by utilizing warp-level operations for faster execution
// Avoid branching on small values in log calculation to minimize warp divergence
