```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for x_bin_scores and y_bin_scores
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Consider optimizing the nested loop by tiling or parallelizing
// Unroll more loops manually if loop count is small and predictable
// Reduce redundant calculations by computing frequently used values once
// Ensure memory accesses for entropies_x, entropies_y, and mis are on aligned boundaries
