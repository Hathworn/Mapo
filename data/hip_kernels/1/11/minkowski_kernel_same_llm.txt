```
// Consider using float2 for memory coalescing when accessing vg_a and vg_b
// Align pitch to be a multiple of preferred memory alignment to improve coalesced access
// Use shared memory to store results of __powf calculations for reuse within the block
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access by padding shared memory array
// Use more than one warp for final reduction if k is large enough
// Prefetch vg_a data into registers if k is small to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure global memory stores are coalesced when writing to d
