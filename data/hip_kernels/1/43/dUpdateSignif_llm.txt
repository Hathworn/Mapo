```
// Consider using shared memory to cache tcutoffs array to optimize memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning gpuData and gpuResults properly
// Utilize warp shuffle operations for better intra-warp communication
// Analyze the use of float vs. double for precision and performance trade-off
// Consider merging small kernels to reduce kernel launch overhead
