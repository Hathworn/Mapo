// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better bandwidth utilization
// Prefer using registers for computation to minimize shared memory usage
// Apply loop unrolling for better performance in the reduction loop
// Consider using atomic operations for reduction if applicable
