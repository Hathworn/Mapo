```
// Use shared memory to cache means and numPairs to reduce global memory accesses.
// Unroll the loop to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Check for NaNs before calculations to avoid redundant computation.
// Use binary tree reduction in shared memory to minimize latency.
// Ensure only the first thread writes the final result to minimize contention.
