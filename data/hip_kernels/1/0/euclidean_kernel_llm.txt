// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing vg_a and vg_b with contiguous thread indices.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by minimizing usage outside of reduction operations.
// Consider loop unrolling within the accumulation loop for improved performance.
// Minimize synchronization overhead by reducing the number of __syncthreads calls where possible.
// Optimize register usage by ensuring local variables are declared within the smallest necessary scope.
