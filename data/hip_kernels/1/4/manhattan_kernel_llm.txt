```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced global memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Prefer loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Utilize __syncthreads() for synchronizing threads within the block
// Use pitch for 2D array alignment to improve memory access patterns
```
