```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for mean and sd values
// Pre-load shared values once per block to reduce redundant memory operations
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate thread sums to minimize atomic operations
// Each thread calculates partial results independently to optimize parallel computation
// Reduce bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory access patterns in shared memory
// Perform parallel reduction to aggregate results efficiently
// Minimize global memory access by reusing data in shared memory
