```cpp
// Optimize memory access by coalescing loads from global memory
// Minimize global memory writes by using shared memory for intermediate sums
// Consider loop unrolling in the dimension loop for better performance
// Use warp-level primitives (e.g., __shfl_down_sync) instead of shared memory for reduction
```
