```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data structures.
// Minimize divergent branches within warps for better efficiency.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointer parameters to avoid redundant loads.
// Exploit shared memory usage by blocking copy data in chunks.
// Consider data prefetching to hide memory latency.
// Use half precision if tolerable for smaller memory footprint and increased bandwidth.
