```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses with warp boundaries
// Optimize global memory access by considering memory coalescing patterns
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider using atomic operations judiciously to avoid serialization
// Implement parallel reduction for computing min and max values efficiently
// Minimize synchronization within the warp for better performance
// Balance workload within blocks to maximize occupancy and resource utilization
