```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data accesses within warps.
// Minimize global memory writes by first checking the condition before updating values.
// Use loop unrolling if the memory access pattern allows for predictable loop bounds.
