```
// Optimize memory access by employing shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Unroll loops if any exist for computational redundancy reduction.
// Use vectorized data loading/storing to improve memory efficiency.
// Consider memory coalescing to enhance read/write operations to global memory.
