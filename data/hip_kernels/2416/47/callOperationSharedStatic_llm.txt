```cpp
// Load data into shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize shared memory operations
// Reduce global memory operations by performing calculations in shared memory
// Ensure that __syncthreads() are used correctly to avoid race conditions
// Optimize the number of threads per block to balance memory utilization
