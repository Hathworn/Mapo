```
// Consider coalesced global memory access by using contiguous threads to access contiguous data
// Minimize synchronization points when possible by optimizing thread cooperation
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can apply if there are repetitive operations to reduce overhead
// Ensure that shared memory size is adequately allocated and used efficiently to avoid bank conflicts
// Where applicable, consider using warp-level primitives for reduction operations
