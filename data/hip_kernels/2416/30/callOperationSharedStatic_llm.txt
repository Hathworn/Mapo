```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have copied data to shared memory
// Avoid redundant computation by preloading frequently accessed variables into registers
// Optimize bank conflicts in shared memory by carefully managing thread access patterns
