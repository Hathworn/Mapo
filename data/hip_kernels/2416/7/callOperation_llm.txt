// Ensure data is coalesced to improve global memory access efficiency
// Consider using shared memory if accessing b[tid] * x repeatedly across threads
// Minimize divergence by maintaining consistent operation paths within warp
// Check if loop unrolling could benefit performance for small fixed sizes
