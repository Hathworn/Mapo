```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate data for better memory access patterns.
// Use vectorized loads/stores if possible to enhance memory throughput.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling if further iterations are required inside the kernel.
// Use asynchronous memory copies if data transfer is a bottleneck.
