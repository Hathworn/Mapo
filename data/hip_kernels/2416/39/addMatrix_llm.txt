```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Ensure grid and block dimensions fit the problem size efficiently
// Use shared memory if accessing the same memory locations repeatedly
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers
// Avoid unnecessary calculations within the kernel
// If possible, use constant memory for values that do not change
