```
// Efficient use of shared memory with dynamic allocation
// Load scalar values into shared memory once to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure all threads have the scalar values with __syncthreads()
// Load array elements into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure all data is loaded before computation with __syncthreads()
// Perform computations using data in shared memory to improve performance
// Save results back to global memory efficiently
