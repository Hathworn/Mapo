```
// Use coalesced memory access for global memory reads and writes
// Consider increasing the size of shared memory allocation if needed
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() where possible to reduce synchronization overhead
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling for calculations
// Ensure block size is optimal for target architecture to maximize occupancy
