// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Ensure the size of dynamically-allocated shared memory is matched with the access patterns.
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel to avoid divergent warps.
// Evaluate the necessity of special handling for parameters 'k' and 'p' and consider constant memory for frequently used variables.
