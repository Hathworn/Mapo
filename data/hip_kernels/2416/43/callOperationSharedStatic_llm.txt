```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for global memory loads
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider using a more local scope for shared memory to maximize its utilization
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits to prevent fallback to global memory
// Calculate thread index efficiently to reduce arithmetic operations
// Use warp-based reduction if applicable to enhance performance with fewer synchronization barriers
```
