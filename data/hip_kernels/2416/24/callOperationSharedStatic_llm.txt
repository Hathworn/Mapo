```
// Consider aligning shared memory arrays to improve access speed
// Evaluate if the shared memory size can be reduced for further optimization
// Ensure coalesced access pattern to global memory arrays a and b
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization (__syncthreads) if operations are independent
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied for operations in shared memory
// Use vectorized data types for a and b to improve memory throughput
