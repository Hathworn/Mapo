```
// Consider aligning data access patterns to improve coalesced memory access.
// Check if shared memory size usage can be minimized to reduce bank conflicts.
// Ensure shared memory usage aligns with warp size to optimize latency.
// Explore using half-warp partitioning for reduced synchronization overhead.
// Investigate using texture or surface memory for better caching performance on read-heavy data.
