```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for global memory loads
// Reduce the usage of shared memory to only store critical data
// Optimize thread block size to match warp size and maximize occupancy
// Minimize synchronization points by reordering computations
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for memory accesses
```
