```
// Consider using shared memory for reusing common data among threads
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for improved global memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring uniform execution paths
// Experiment with different block sizes to identify the optimal configuration for the target hardware
// Prefetch data to registers if reused within the kernel
