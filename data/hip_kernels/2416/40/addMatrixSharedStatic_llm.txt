```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading input data into shared memory
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage by using dynamic shared memory if possible
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used correctly to avoid race conditions
// Perform boundary checks before accessing shared memory to prevent out-of-bounds access
// Reduce the number of accesses to global memory by using shared memory effectively
