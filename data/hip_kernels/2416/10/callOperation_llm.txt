```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data access with warp size
// Minimize branching to improve warp execution efficiency
// Prefetch data if there are predictable access patterns
// Evaluate potential for loop unrolling if applicable
// Use constant memory for widely used constants
