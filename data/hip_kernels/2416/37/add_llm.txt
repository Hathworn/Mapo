```cpp
// Consider using more threads to perform parallel addition rather than single-threaded.
// Enhance memory access pattern by splitting workload across multiple threads.
// Use memory coalescing to improve memory access efficiency by aligning data accesses.
// Avoid serialization by reducing dependency on __syncthreads() for single-threaded operation.
