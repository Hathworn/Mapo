```
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for global memory reads
// Ensure shared memory usage is within hardware limits to prevent bank conflicts
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction or synchronization when applicable
// Check for opportunities to reduce register pressure
// Align shared memory allocation to prevent potential padding issues
```
