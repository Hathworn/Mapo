// Consider reducing global memory accesses by using shared memory efficiently.
// Ensure shared memory is being used to minimize global memory reads and writes.
// Check if further mapping to shared memory can reduce bank conflicts.
// Evaluate the number of threads per block to ensure optimal shared memory allocation.
// Ensure coalesced accesses to global memory for improved memory throughput.
