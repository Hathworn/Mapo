```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for a and b when loading into shared memory
// Ensure shared memory is sized efficiently to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize the use of shared memory to reduce shared memory bank conflicts
// Align data to reduce misaligned memory access overhead
// Avoid unnecessary use of shared memory if computations can be done directly
// Consider vectorized loads and stores if applicable
// Ensure __syncthreads() is minimized and utilized effectively
```
