```
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores to enhance memory throughput.
// Optimize shared memory usage by utilizing memory banks efficiently.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory access patterns.
// Ensure that shared memory usage aligns with warp size to prevent bank conflicts.
// Employ loop unrolling in computation to minimize overhead.
// Leverage asynchronous data transfer where possible to hide latency.
