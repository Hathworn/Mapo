```
// Minimize memory copy operations between global and shared memory
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses when accessing global memory
// Ensure shared memory size does not exceed hardware limitations
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid performance bottlenecks
// Evaluate if shared memory provides tangible performance benefits
