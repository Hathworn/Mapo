```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loading a and b
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize shared memory usage by removing unneeded allocations
// Avoid excessive use of shared memory if block size is large
// Utilize registers efficiently to reduce shared memory usage
// Ensure early exit conditions are efficiently handled
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for additional performance
// Align data in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
