```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads and writes where possible
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetch instructions for better data loading efficiency
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find optimal configuration for workload
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to indicate that pointers do not alias for better compiler optimizations
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed available on GPU to prevent spills to global memory
