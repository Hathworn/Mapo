```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loading and storing to global memory
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and latency
// Load frequently accessed data (like 'x') into shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions
