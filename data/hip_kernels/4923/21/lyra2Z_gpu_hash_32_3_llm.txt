// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve computational throughput.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Minimize use of expensive operations and leverage hardware intrinsics where possible.
// Avoid divergent branching to maximize warp efficiency.
