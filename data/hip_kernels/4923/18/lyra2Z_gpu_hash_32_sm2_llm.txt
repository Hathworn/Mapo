```
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access.
// Reduce divergent branches by minimizing conditional statements within the critical path.
// Use shared memory to reduce access to global memory wherever possible.
// Consider loop unrolling if any repetitive operations are involved to reduce instruction overhead.
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency.
