```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Reduce atomic operations by first accumulating in shared memory
// Apply loop unrolling to the reduction phase if needed for performance
// Optimize for warp divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path
