```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as weights, to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses for gradInput, target, and weights.
// Reduce branching by restructuring conditional statements to minimize divergence among threads.
// Use loop unrolling techniques to optimize the single loop over all elements handled by this block.
// Assess the use of atomic operations or warp-level primitives to optimize access to total_weight.
