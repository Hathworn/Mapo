```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize global memory access patterns.
// If possible, ensure coalesced access by aligning data structures.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of loop unrolling for arithmetic operations.
// Explore using constant memory for read-only data that doesn't change per kernel call.
// Ensure that memory access patterns minimize bank conflicts.
