```
// Use shared memory for faster access to frequently used data
// Optimize thread block size to match warp size for better efficiency
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Experiment with different grid and block dimensions for optimal performance
// Minimize register usage by reusing variables whenever possible
