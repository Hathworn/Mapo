```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Minimize shared memory use by ensuring calculations are done in registers when possible
// Use shared memory to cache common data accessed by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory transaction by aligning data structures to minimize memory transactions
// Consider vectorized operations to process multiple data elements in a single instruction
