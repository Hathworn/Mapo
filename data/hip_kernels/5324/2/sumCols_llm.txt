```
// Consider using shared memory to cache the segment of d_matrix being processed
// Ensure enough threads are used to fully occupy the GPU for better performance
// Perform memory access coalescing for improved bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergence in the grid by ensuring all threads within a block perform similar work
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to help the compiler with optimization if applicable
