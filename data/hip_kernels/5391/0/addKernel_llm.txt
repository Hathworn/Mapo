```cpp
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently reused data
// Ensure data is coalesced for efficient global memory access
// Consider using a more appropriate grid and block size configuration
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous memory operations if applicable
```
