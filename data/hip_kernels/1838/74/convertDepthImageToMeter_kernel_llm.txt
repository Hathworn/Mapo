```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads from d_depth_image_millimeter.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access overlapping data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using float4 or similar data types to increase throughput by vectorizing operations.
// Minimize divergence by checking bounds before calculating the global index.
// Ensure appropriate grid and block dimensions for maximal occupancy and minimal latency.
