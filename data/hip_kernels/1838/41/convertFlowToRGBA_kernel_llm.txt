```
// Use direct arithmetic for indexing to reduce computation overhead.
// Avoid sqrtf and direct calculation if possible to enhance performance.
// Avoid sqrtf by comparing squared magnitudes to reduce computation.
// Use make_uchar4 for compact assignment to save register space.
// Ensure that arithmetic operations are kept within manageable limits to avoid overflow.
// Consider memory coalescing by structuring data accesses in a contiguous manner.
// Minimize use of conditional branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Use texture memory or shared memory if data access patterns become problematic.
