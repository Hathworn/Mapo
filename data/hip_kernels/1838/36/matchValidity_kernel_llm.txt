```
// Use shared memory to cache values and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced access of global memory for optimal performance.
// Minimize divergent branches by handling invalid cases outside critical paths.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to improve throughput.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned and coalesced where possible.
