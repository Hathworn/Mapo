```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data such as disparity, Zbuffer, and normals to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring alignment of global memory reads, which may involve padding data structures or reorganizing accesses.
// Minimize divergence in threads by restructuring conditionals where applicable.
// Check if using texture memory for read-only data could improve performance due to caching benefits.
