```c
// Use shared memory for accumulation to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure that shared memory is initialized by all threads collectively.
// Use atomic operations in shared memory to handle concurrent writes.
// After accumulation, synchronize threads before using accumulated data.
// Write results from shared to global memory using a single thread to avoid concurrency issues.
