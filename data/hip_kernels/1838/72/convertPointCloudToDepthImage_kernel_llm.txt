```cpp
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for transformation matrices if possible.
// Consider using texture memory for point_cloud data to leverage cache benefits.
// Ensure coalesced access for point_cloud reads to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Prevent bank conflicts if shared memory is utilized for transformation data.
