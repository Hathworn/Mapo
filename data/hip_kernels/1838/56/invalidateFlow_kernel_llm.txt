```
// Use coalesced memory access to ensure contiguous memory access patterns
// Minimize divergence by ensuring conditional statements are aligned across threads
// Consider using shared memory if neighboring thread data is frequently accessed
// Optimize arithmetic operations within performance-critical sections, such as err calculation
// Align data structures to cache line size to maximize cache efficiency
// Consider using texture or surface memory for read-only data to improve cache hit rates
