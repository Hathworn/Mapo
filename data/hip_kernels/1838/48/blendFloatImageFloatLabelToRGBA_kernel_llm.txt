// Combine index calculation and bounds check to reduce branching  
// Use shared memory for in_image and label to improve memory access speed  
// Consider loop unrolling for critical sections  
// Align data structures to reduce memory access overhead  
// Use warp shuffle or cooperative groups if possible for reduction tasks
