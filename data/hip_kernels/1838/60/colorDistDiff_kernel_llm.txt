// Consider coalesced memory accesses for 'disparity' to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Reuse the precomputed reciprocal 'recip_f' to avoid redundant calculations.
// Explore using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to minimize global memory loads.
// Evaluate memory access patterns for 'disparity_prior' to improve coalescing.
