```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Ensure coalesced access when fetching data from global memory.
// Consider employing vectorized loads for better memory throughput.
// Use warp-level primitives for efficient in-block reduction.
// Unroll loops where possible to reduce loop overhead.
// Explore using __shfl_sync for inter-lane communication to minimize shared memory usage.
// Minimize branch divergence, especially within if-else blocks.
// Consider optimizing the access pattern of d_start_ind_flow and d_ind_flow_Zbuffer.
// Evaluate the use of __ldg intrinsic for read-only data to utilize texture cache.
// Balance computational workload among different blocks to prevent load imbalance.
