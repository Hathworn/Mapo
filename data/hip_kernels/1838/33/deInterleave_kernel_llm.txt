```
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for d_XY_in loading
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for reuse within a block
// Consider loop unrolling if processing multiple elements per thread
// Ensure proper memory alignment for pitched memory
// Minimize divergence by limiting the use of conditional statements
