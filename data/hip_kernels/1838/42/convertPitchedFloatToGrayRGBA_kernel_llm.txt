// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of in_image for faster access
// Reduce bank conflicts when using shared memory by padding with an extra float per row
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns for both in_image and out_image 
// Ensure alignment of memory and data structures to reduce access time
