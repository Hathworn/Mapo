// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data layout to warp size.
// Use float2 instead of separate float elements for better memory access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to improve computational throughput.
// Use shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize atomic operations by minimizing contention and increase parallelism.
