// Consider optimizing block size to match shared memory limits
// Load global memory data into shared memory to minimize latency
// Use coalesced access patterns to improve throughput
// Ensure memory access patterns avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Implement __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded shared memory
// Optimize warp efficiency by aligning with shared memory usage
// Balance shared memory usage with register allocation for best performance
