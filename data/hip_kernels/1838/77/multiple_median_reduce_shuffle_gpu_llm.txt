// Consider using warp-level operations to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Ensure data accesses are coalesced to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory accesses.
// Minimize redundant calculation of indices within the loop.
// Explore loop unrolling to enhance performance in the reduction stage.
