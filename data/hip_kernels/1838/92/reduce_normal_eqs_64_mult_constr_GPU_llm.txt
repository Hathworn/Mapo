```cpp
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce latency.
// Use __ldg() to utilize global memory read-only cache for frequently accessed data.
// Investigate shared memory bank conflicts in DATA array access patterns.
// If applicable, consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve efficiency.
// Evaluate if using float2 or float4 can improve memory throughput where applicable.
// Test the impact of using asynchronous copies for data movement to/from shared memory.
