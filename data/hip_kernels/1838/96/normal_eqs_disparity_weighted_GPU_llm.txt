```cpp
// Use shared memory to store A-matrix values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for partial reductions to enhance performance.
// Reduce global memory access by using registers for frequently used variables.
