```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads
// Consider caching repeated calculations to reduce computational load
// Optimize occupancy by ensuring adequate blocks and threads per block
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory by proper index alignment
// Unroll loops where applicable to enhance performance
// Minimize divergent branches within kernels for optimal warp execution
