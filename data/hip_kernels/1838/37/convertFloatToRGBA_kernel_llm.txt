```
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same input element to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure the input image and output image pointers are properly aligned for coalesced access.
// Reduce divergence by minimizing the use of conditional branches within the kernel.
// Consider using texture memory if spatial locality is high for input image access.
