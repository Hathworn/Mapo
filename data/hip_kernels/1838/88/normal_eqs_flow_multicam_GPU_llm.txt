```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns to coalesce loads and stores
// Reduce unnecessary global memory transactions by using shared memory
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits to prevent bank conflicts
// Prefer faster math operations like __fdividef for performance improvements
// Apply sync operations smartly to avoid unnecessary thread stalls
// Balance computational load across blocks to prevent divergence
// Consider larger block sizes if shared memory and registers allow
// Evaluate use of loop unrolling for repetitive operations within loops
