```
// Coalesce memory access for d_vector_X and d_vector_Y to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage of frequently accessed variables like vector_X and vector_Y.
// Ensure that accesses to global memory are coalesced by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Optimize the atan2f and hypotf operations if possible to improve computational performance.
// Precompute (1.0f / (upper_ang - lower_ang)) and (1.0f / (upper_mag - lower_mag)) to avoid repeated division in the kernel.
