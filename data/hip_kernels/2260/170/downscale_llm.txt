```cpp
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to store blocks of gradOutput_data temporarily.
// Minimize global memory transactions by accumulating results in registers before writing to global memory.
// Unroll the loop to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed their operations on shared memory before proceeding.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to gradOutput_data for better memory throughput.
// Align memory accesses to improve global memory access efficiency.
