```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threadIdx.x with data structure
// Consider preloading data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Ensure out of bounds access checks are optimized
// Evaluate use of warp-level primitives for potential performance gains
