// Ensure shared memory is used efficiently to load data for multiple channels
// Use coalesced memory access for bottom0 and bottom1 arrays
// Implement loop unrolling in kernel_size loops to improve performance
// Consider using memory prefetching techniques to hide latency
// Optimize the use of shared memory to minimize bank conflicts
// Check if using atomic operations can reduce reduction overhead in sum array
