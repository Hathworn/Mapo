```
// Use cooperative indexing to avoid shared memory bank conflicts in memory access
// Exit threads early that don't perform meaningful work to save computation resources
// Pre-compute constants outside of loops to minimize redundant calculations during execution
// Compute boundaries only once outside of nested loops to reduce redundant arithmetic operations
// Use max and min functions to ensure indices are within bounds and avoid out-of-range access
// Accumulate results using topdiff values to streamline computation within the kernel
// Normalize sum by dividing by sumelems for memory access efficiency and accurate result computation
