```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory more efficiently by minimizing unnecessary loads and reusing data.
// Optimize thread mapping to reduce bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by grouping threads performing similar operations.
// Prefetch global memory data into shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Unroll inner loops where beneficial to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data if spatial locality is high.
// Double buffer shared memory if feasible to overlap compute with memory operations.
