```
// Optimize memory accesses by minimizing global memory reads
// Use shared memory to cache repetitive data accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for bottom0, bottom1, and topdiff
// Prefetch data to reduce access latency
// Reduce redundant calculations by computing indices outside loops if possible
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance of inner loops
