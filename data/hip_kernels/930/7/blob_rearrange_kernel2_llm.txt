```cpp
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from cache.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory in the algorithm.
// Ensure the number of threads per block is a multiple of warp size for optimal performance.
// Balance the grid size and block size for better occupancy and load balancing.
