// Consider using shared memory for bottom data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns to coalesce memory reads and writes.
// Use loop unrolling for small fixed-size loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Consider pre-fetching data to registers for frequently accessed elements in inner loops.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned for optimal throughput.
