```
// Use shared memory for reused data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access among threads.
// Minimize thread divergence by structuring conditional statements effectively.
// Consider loop unrolling if repetitive calculations exist.
// Use vectorized data types if memory alignment and access patterns allow.
