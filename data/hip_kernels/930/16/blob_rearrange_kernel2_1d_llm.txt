```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently reused data
// Align memory accesses to coalesced memory transactions if possible
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring optimal memory access patterns
// Evaluate if texture memory could be beneficial for read-heavy operations
// Check if loop unrolling might offer performance benefits depending on the GPU architecture
// Prefetch data where patterns allow to hide latency
// Analyze if reducing divergent branching would improve performance
