```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure all threads are within bounds to prevent unnecessary operations.
// Reduce the number of active threads per step by half the interval.
// Only synchronize threads when necessary to optimize performance.
// Ensure recursive call is made only by the main block to prevent multiple launches.
