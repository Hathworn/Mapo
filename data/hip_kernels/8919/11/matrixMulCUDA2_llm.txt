```
// Use shared memory to store tiles of matrices A and B for reuse by threads
// Optimize global memory accesses by aligning data to coalesced memory patterns
// Prefer loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Evaluate potential warp-level optimization for better efficiency
// Analyze the impact of increasing TILE_WIDTH on performance
