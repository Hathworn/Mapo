```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency and increase bandwidth.
// Ensure all threads are synchronized before accessing shared memory to prevent race conditions.
// Align shared memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts and improve performance.
// Consider optimizing loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism.
