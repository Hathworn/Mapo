```c
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure shared memory is thoroughly utilized for load efficiency.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions within the block.
// Ensure each thread block computes a tile of the result matrix independently.
// Reduce global memory access latency by coalescing accesses where possible.
