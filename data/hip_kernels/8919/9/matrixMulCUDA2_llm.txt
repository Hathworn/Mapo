```
// Consider using shared memory to store A and B tiles to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads from global memory.
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism and reduce loop overhead.
// Consider using vectorized loads to further improve memory bandwidth utilization.
