```
// Ensure vectorSize is a multiple of warpSize for optimal memory access
// Use shared memory for intermediate results if multiple operations follow
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for input pointers to improve optimization
// Align data structures for coalesced memory access
// Remove or minimize unnecessary branching for consistent execution speed
// Prefetch data into registers if a and b are reused across iterations
