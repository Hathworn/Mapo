// Consider using shared memory for arrays xh, yh, zh, xt, yt, zt to further reduce global memory accesses.
// Use texture memory for constant read-only data like field_m if applicable for better memory access patterns.
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling in the inner loop for better instruction throughput.
// Check alignment of memory accesses to ensure coalesced accesses for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using warp synchronization where possible to reduce synchronization overhead.
