```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to access eps, xh, yh, zh arrays.
// Consider padding structures to avoid unaligned memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Prefetch data to registers to hide memory latency and reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Minimize branching within warp by aligning the condition checks across threads.
