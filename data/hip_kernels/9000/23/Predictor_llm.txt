```
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only variables like multipliers
// Consider using shared memory for accessing parameters within the same block to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for p_corr, v_corr, and acc arrays
// Consider loop unrolling if prediction steps are fixed and known at compile time
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring the index validation logic
// Prefetch data to registers where possible to hide memory latency
