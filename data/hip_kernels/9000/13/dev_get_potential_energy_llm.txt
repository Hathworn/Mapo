```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling to improve instruction level parallelism
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns for fxh, fyh, fzh arrays to improve memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize latency during arithmetic operations
// Opt for warp-synchronous programming to optimize reduction within blocks
