// Consider optimizing memory coalescing when reading from global memory.
// Minimize conditional branches for efficiency.
// Group memory load/store operations for better performance.
// Consider further optimization by unrolling loops if applicable.
// Evaluate thread block size for optimal performance regarding shared memory usage.
// Assess the use of warp-level primitives to minimize divergence.
