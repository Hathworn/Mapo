// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by accessing elements in a linear, aligned order
// Minimize register usage to ensure more registers per thread and avoid spilling
// Consider restructuring data access patterns for improved cache usage
