// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for shacc load operations.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by possibly aligning shaccelerations[].
// Consider prefetching data from global memory into shared memory in chunks.
// Balance shared memory synchronization (__syncthreads()) to avoid unnecessary stalls.
// Optimize shared memory utilization by analyzing shaccelerations[] size.
