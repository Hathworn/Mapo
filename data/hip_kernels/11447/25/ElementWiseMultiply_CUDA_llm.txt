// Utilize shared memory to reduce repeated global memory reads for A and B  
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data appropriately  
// Minimize register pressure by optimizing variable usage and reducing live variable spans  
// Use warp-level programming techniques to further optimize memory access patterns
