// Consider organizing shared memory access to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Optimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper alignment
// Check if reducing shared memory size could improve occupancy and performance
// Ensure that __syncthreads() usage is necessary and does not incur unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Evaluate if tiling techniques or further partitioning work could enhance performance
