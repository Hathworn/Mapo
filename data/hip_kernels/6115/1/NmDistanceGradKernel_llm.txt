```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for xyz1 and xyz2.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations where possible.
// Utilize shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize the mapping of threads to data elements to improve memory access efficiency.
// Investigate warp divergence and improve the alignment of thread execution paths.
