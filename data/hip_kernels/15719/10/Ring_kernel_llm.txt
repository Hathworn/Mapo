```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for often-used data
// Optimize memory coalescing by arranging data access patterns to be more sequential
// Minimize repeated calculations by computing invariants outside of loops
// Align data in memory to ensure optimal access patterns, reducing bank conflicts
// Use warp-shuffle instructions to reduce redundant loading of BP values
