// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads
// Pre-load frequently accessed data to shared memory to minimize global memory latency
// Use warp divergence minimization techniques by aligning conditional checks across warp threads
// Consider using vectorized memory access to reduce the number of transactions between global and shared memory
