```c
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access for better performance
// Consider adjusting the block and grid sizes to balance load and ensure efficient resource usage
// Evaluate the potential benefits of using more registers per thread to store temporary computations
// Analyze whether loop unrolling can be applied to further reduce the number of executed instructions
// Investigate whether using float2 or float4 types could optimize memory accesses in some scenarios
