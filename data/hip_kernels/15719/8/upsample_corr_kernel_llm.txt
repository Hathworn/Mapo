```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance.
// Use float variables for precomputed ratios to avoid casting overhead.
// Make use of __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to leverage potential aliasing benefits.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable in future iterations.
// Utilize occupancy calculator to determine optimal block size for better GPU utilization.
// Explore asynchronous memory copy operations between host and device.
