```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data.
// Preload data from global memory to registers or shared memory where appropriate.
// Align data structures in memory to optimize memory bandwidth and reduce cache line splits.
// Employ loop unrolling techniques to minimize loop overhead and improve instruction throughput.
// Use warp-synchronous programming to take advantage of warp-wide operations.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses within the same warp.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory to maximize efficiency.
