// Use shared memory to speed up memory access for small patch sizes
// Avoid redundant memory accesses by storing temporary results in shared memory
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop to improve warp execution efficiency
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized for the architecture and fits within hardware limits
// Consider using texture or cache memory for read-only data to enhance memory throughput
// Try to align memory access patterns to improve coalesced memory access
