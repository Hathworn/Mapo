// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches by reducing branching conditions
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize global memory latency
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance performance in inner loops
