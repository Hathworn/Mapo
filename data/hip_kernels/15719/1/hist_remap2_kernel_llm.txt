```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data such as cumJ and histJ for faster access
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize divergent code paths, especially inside the while loop
// Consider unrolling loops for improved performance if the loop bounds are small and static
// Align access to global memory with natural memory boundaries to improve memory efficiency
// Reduce the number of kernel function arguments by grouping related data into structures if possible
// Preload data to reduce repeated global memory access, increasing data locality
