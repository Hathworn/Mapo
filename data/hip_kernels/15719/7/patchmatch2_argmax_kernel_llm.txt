```
// Consider using shared memory to cache and reuse data within thread blocks to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data access with warp execution.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling to optimize loops with a fixed iteration count for better performance.
