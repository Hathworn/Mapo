```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Employ loop unrolling to minimize instruction costs.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for A, B, AP, and BP.
// Optimize thread block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Minimize register usage for improved performance.
// Ensure alignment of data in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use double buffering to overlap computation and memory transfer if possible.
