// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed input and target values.
// Ensure efficient boundary checks to minimize unnecessary calculations.
// Reduce stride-dependent loop calculations to maximize computational efficiency.
// Ensure proper memory alignment and access patterns to optimize memory throughput.
// Consider optimizing usage of registers for computation-heavy operations.
