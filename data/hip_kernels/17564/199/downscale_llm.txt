```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __restrict__ pointers to hint that pointers do not alias
// Explore using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead for scale_factor loops
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better workload distribution
// Prefer warp-shuffle operations for thread communication where possible
