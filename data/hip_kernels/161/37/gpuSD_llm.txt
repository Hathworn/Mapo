```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Consider implementing loop unrolling manually for further improvement
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() within reduction to improve performance
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for an optimized reduction
// Optimize usage of threadIdx.x within the loop to reduce branch divergence
