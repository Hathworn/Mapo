```cpp
// Ensure successive memory accesses are by contiguous threads to improve coalescing.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for better memory throughput.
// Reduce overall synchronization by minimizing the number of __syncthreads() calls.
```
