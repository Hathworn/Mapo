```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to x_bin_scores and y_bin_scores for better performance.
// Explore using shared memory to store data from x_bins and y_bins to reduce global memory accesses.
// Check the efficiency of the nested loops and look for opportunities to unroll them if beneficial.
// Evaluate the use of FMA (fused multiply-add) to enhance both accuracy and performance.
// Use texture or constant memory for frequently accessed data that changes infrequently.
// Ensure all memory transactions are aligned to maximize throughput on the GPU.
