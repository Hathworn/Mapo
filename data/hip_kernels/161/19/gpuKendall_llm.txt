```
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns in for loops
// Transpose order for better coalesced shared memory access
// Perform reduction within shared memory for atomic operations
// Limit use of atomics by leveraging shared memory efficiently
