```
// Consider using texture memory for accessing vg_a and vg_b to improve memory access pattern.
// Optimize pitch access by using coalesced memory access to vg_a and vg_b.
// Avoid excessive usage of shared memory by reducing its size if possible.
// Ensure all global memory writes are coalesced for optimal bandwidth usage.
// Evaluate the use of warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of shared memory.
// Analyze potential benefits of preferring atomic operations for reduction.
