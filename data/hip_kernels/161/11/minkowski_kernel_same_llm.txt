```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by properly aligning memory access patterns
// Cache frequently accessed data in shared memory to reduce global memory fetches
// Utilize stride looping to maximize thread efficiency
// Apply fast intrinsic functions for parallel reduction operations
// Perform symmetric calculations to minimize redundant computations
