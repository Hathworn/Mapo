```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring data is aligned for warp-based operations.
// Use shared memory to store column data for faster access and reduce global memory traffic.
// Attempt further loop unrolling for the scaling loop if nsamples is known to be large.
// Consider leveraging vectorized data types if possible, e.g., float4, to process multiple elements per thread.
