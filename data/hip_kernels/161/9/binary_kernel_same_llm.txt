```
// Optimize memory access by minimizing bank conflicts in shared memory
// Avoid redundant memory reads by loading data into registers where possible
// Use loop unrolling in the calculation loop to reduce control overhead
// Ensure coalescing of global memory reads for improved performance
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for inter-thread communication instead of shared memory
