```
// Consider using memory coalescing to optimize global memory access pattern
// Explore using vector types (like float4) to align memory accesses
// Investigate the use of texture memory for readonly data to improve cache performance
// Implement loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead in the innermost loop
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access where possible
// Use warp shuffle operations to minimize the need for shared memory in reduction
// Consider using asynchronous copy to shared memory to overlap memory transfer with computation
