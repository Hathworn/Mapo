// Optimize memory reads by loading more data into shared memory.
// Consider using loop unrolling to improve thread throughput.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access to minimize latency.
// Use shared memory efficiently by applying bank conflict avoidance techniques.
// Utilize warp-level primitives for reduction to enhance performance.
