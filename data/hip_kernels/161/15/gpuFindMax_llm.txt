// Consider using texture memory for improved memory access when reading data.
// Use shared memory as a cache to minimize global memory transactions per thread.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Explore prefetching techniques to reduce memory latency and improve throughput.
