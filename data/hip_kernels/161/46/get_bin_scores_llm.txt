```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like knots, reducing global memory access.
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for the x and bins arrays.
// Apply loop unrolling to optimize loop iterations and reduce latency.
// Evaluate the potential of using texture memory for read-only access patterns with the knots array.
// Minimize the number of branches within loops to improve warp execution efficiency.
