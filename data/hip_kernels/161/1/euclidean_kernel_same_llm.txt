```
// Unroll loop and reduce global memory accesses
// Use shared memory to temporarily store partial results
// Optimize data access patterns to minimize warp divergence
// Implement coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Optimize reduction using loop unrolling
// Minimize synchronization by reducing the number of __syncthreads calls
// Use thread-specific sums to reduce the need for shared memory
