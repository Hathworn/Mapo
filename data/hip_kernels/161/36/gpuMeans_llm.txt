```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for vectsA and vectsB by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize access latency and promote bank conflicts avoidance.
// Implement memory access pattern optimization by aligning data structures to minimize misaligned accesses.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction instead of shared memory to improve performance.
