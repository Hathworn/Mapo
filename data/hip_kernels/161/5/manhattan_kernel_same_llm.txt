```c
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for vg_a within the loop
// Align shared memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead when summing absolute differences
// Explore employing vectorized loads if hardware supports it for vg_a access
// Consider using __half precision calculations if sufficient and supported
// Attempt to reduce __syncthreads() calls if possible to optimize synchronization overhead
// Explore warp shuffle operations to perform the reduction instead of shared memory
