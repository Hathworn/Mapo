```cpp
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access
// Loop unrolling is applied to enhance computational efficiency
// Utilize shuffle reduction within warp to avoid global memory writes
// Minimize memory access by using __shfl_down_sync for reduction
// Only write to global memory when absolutely necessary
```
