```
// Use shared memory to cache repetitive memory accesses to tRCoeffs and tUnrCoeffs
// Minimize branching in the loop by ensuring 'rows' is even for better unrolling effectiveness
// Employ atomic operations or warp-level primitives if possible to reduce thread divergence
// Consider using asynchronous copy and compute with streams for overlapping data transfer and computation
