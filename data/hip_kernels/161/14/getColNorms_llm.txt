```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to 'da' to improve throughput
// Minimize redundant loading of 'col[i]' by storing it in a register
// Use a reduction algorithm for shared memory accumulation to prevent race conditions
// Avoid using shared memory beyond its necessity to reduce usage
// Consider unrolling the inner loop to enhance performance
// Use warp shuffle operations instead of shared memory for reduction
