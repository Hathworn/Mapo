// Consider using shared memory to temporarily store data that threads need to swap to reduce accesses to global memory.
// Evaluate the possibility of coalesced access for dArray to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Ensure that accesses to global memory are aligned to reduce latency and transaction overhead.
// Explore using warp shuffling techniques for faster in-register data exchange without global memory usage.
