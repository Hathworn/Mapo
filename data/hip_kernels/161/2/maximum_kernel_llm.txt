```cpp
// Allocate sufficient shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Avoid redundant threadIdx calculations for more efficient memory access.
// Load elements into shared memory to utilize faster memory access.
// Perform intra-block reduction in shared memory to minimize global synchronization.
