// Consider using shared memory to optimize repetitive bandwidth access for gpuNumPairs and gpuCorrelations.
// Evaluate memory alignment to ensure optimal coalesced memory access.
// Ensure thread synchronization if shared memory is used.
// Utilize asynchronous data loading through __ldg for read-only memory to reduce latency.
