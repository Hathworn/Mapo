```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Explore memory coalescing techniques for accessing mX, vY, mQ, and mR arrays
// Unroll loops further or use warp-level primitives to optimize computation
// Investigate using float4 or other vector types to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Apply register blocking to enhance data reuse within a thread
// Minimize data dependencies where possible to improve parallel execution efficiency
// Consider using asynchronous copy mechanisms to overlap computation and data transfer
