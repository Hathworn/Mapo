```
// Use dynamic shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Implement in-warp reduction using shuffles for efficient sum computation.
// Perform cross-warp reduction to finalize sum in shared memory.
// Ensure only thread 0 computes beta to minimize redundant calculations.
// Use block-wide synchronization for shared memory consistency.
