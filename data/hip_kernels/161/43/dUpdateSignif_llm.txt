```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for tcutoffs
// Loop unrolling the for loop can enhance performance by reducing loop control overhead
// Prefetching data from global memory could reduce latency
// Use __ldg() to load read-only data such as gpuData when accessed multiple times to take advantage of cache
// Consolidate global memory writes to gpuResults to minimize latency
