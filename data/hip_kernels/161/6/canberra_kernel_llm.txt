// Ensure coalesced memory access to vg_a and vg_b by considering alignment or using shared memory.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize redundant global memory access.
// Optimize the reduction step to avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() calls when possible.
// Consider memory bank conflicts in shared memory and ensure stride is optimal for memory coalescence.
