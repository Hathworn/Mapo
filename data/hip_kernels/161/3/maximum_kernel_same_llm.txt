```
// Use a register for the initial max value per thread to reduce global memory access
// Use shared memory for inter-thread communication to minimize global memory traffic
// Reduce max computation in registers to take advantage of faster register access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning pitch calculations with warp definitions
// Use shared memory reduction to aggregate values and reduce global memory write operations
// Utilize synchronization barriers effectively to ensure correct read/write ordering
// Avoid bank conflicts by considering shared memory access patterns in reduction steps
