```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Explore using memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed constant values if applicable
// Optimize memory access by ensuring data alignment for vectors and matrices
// Consider using registers for temporary variables to reduce memory access latency
