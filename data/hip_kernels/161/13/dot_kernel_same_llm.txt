```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for vg_a and vg_b to improve throughput
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Consider using larger block sizes if resources permit to increase occupancy
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring consistent control flow
// Optimize the unroll factor based on the hardware generation for balanced performance
// Minimize synchronizations by optimizing data sharing among threads
// Use half precision or tensor cores if applicable for performance boost
