```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory with continuous threads
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Leverage atomic operations to prevent race conditions during reduction
// Optimize reduction loop by minimizing synchronization and memory write
// Consider loop unrolling for performance enhancement during computation
```
