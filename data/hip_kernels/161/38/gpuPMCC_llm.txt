```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for means, sds, and numPairs
// Ensure coalesced memory access by unrolling the loop
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Consider adjusting grid and block sizes for better occupancy
// To improve performance, consider using float4 for vectorized operations if applicable
// Optimize loop unrolling factors for better instruction throughput
```
