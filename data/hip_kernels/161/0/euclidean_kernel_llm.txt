// Use shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Divide k among threads in the block to ensure coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use __syncthreads() effectively to ensure proper memory transactions between threads.
// Perform reduction with fewer synchronization points for better parallelism.
