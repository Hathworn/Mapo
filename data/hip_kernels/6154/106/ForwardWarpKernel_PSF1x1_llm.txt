```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for u, v, and src arrays.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of data prefetching to hide global memory latency.
// Check if further unrolling of loops is viable to reduce instruction overhead.
