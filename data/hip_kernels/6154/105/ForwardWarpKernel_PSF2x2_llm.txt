```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data if possible to leverage texture cache benefits.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning j and i computations if possible.
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing conditions or computations.
// Ensure that atomic operations are used only when necessary as they can serialize writes.
