```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency.
// Evaluate the need for additional loop unrolling to further optimize performance.
// Assess the block size for optimal occupancy and balance between memory bandwidth and computational efficiency.
// Ensure alignment of data structures for enhanced memory access speed.
// Profile the existing code to identify any additional bottlenecks or underutilized resources.
