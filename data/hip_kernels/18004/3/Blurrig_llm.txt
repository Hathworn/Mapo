```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for input and output arrays.
// Use shared memory to store sections of the input image for reduced global memory reads.
// Employ loop unrolling within the nested loops for computational efficiency.
// Explore optimizing the number of threads per block for better memory access patterns.
// Analyze and adjust block and grid dimensions to match hardware capabilities for best performance.
