```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for the kernel.
// Check for memory coalescing in global memory accesses.
// Ensure minimal bank conflicts if shared memory is used.
// Try loop unrolling if the kernel size is known at compile time.
// Analyze and optimize boundary condition checks.
// Make sure to minimize branch divergence in the warp.
