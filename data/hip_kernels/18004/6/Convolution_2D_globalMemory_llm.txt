```
// Consider coalesced memory access for imgInput and imgOutput
// Use shared memory efficiently to lower global memory access need
// Ensure shared memory size does not exceed available shared memory
// Check alignment of data types for better memory performance
// Optimize thread block size for occupancy and execution efficiency
