```cpp
// Ensure shared memory usage efficiently by using __shared__ for tiles
// For coalesced memory access, ensure Row's access in M and Col's in N are contiguous
// Check boundary conditions for threads to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Use __syncthreads() adequately to synchronize threads after loading tiles
// Minimize global memory access by maximizing the use of shared memory
```
