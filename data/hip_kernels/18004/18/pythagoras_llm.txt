```
// Consider using shared memory to cache Gx and Gy for coalesced access.
// Minimize global memory access by maximizing data reuse through registers.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned for better performance.
// Use constant or texture memory for frequently accessed data if needed.
// Optimize memory access by loading data in coalesced patterns.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring similar execution paths.
