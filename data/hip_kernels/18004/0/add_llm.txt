```
// Consider coalesced memory access for a, b, and c
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring SIZE is a multiple of the block size
// Use shared memory if the data is reused within the block
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if no aliasing occurs
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize occupancy and performance
