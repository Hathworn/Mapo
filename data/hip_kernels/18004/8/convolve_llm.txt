// Consider using shared memory to store tiling elements of imgInput to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement coalesced memory accesses by aligning access patterns with warp size
// Evaluate using __ldg() for read-only data to take advantage of L1 cache
// Ensure data alignment in global memory for efficient access
