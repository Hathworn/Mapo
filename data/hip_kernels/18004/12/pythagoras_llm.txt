// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate values for Gx and Gy to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance computational efficiency within the kernel.
// Attempt to minimize divergence by ensuring threads within the same warp follow the same execution path.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations for simultaneous processing of multiple data points.
