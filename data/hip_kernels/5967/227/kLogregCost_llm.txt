```
// Consider further reducing global memory access by loading all needed data into shared memory at once
// Possible optimization: use float2 or float4 to load multiple probabilities in fewer transactions
// Evaluate if using warp shuffle operations can replace shared memory usage for reducing bank conflicts
// Optimize the atomicAdd operation by minimizing its usage or replacing it with warp-level primitives
