```
// Consider increasing the size of the shared memory if needed
// Ensure that `__syncthreads()` is used after loading data into shared memory to avoid race conditions
// Optimize the size of blockDim.x to maximize occupancy and balance between shared memory usage and register usage
// Ensure that data loading into shared memory is efficient and coalesced
