// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with data elements
// Consider using shared memory for lifter_coeffs to reduce global memory access
// Minimize thread divergence by structuring conditional logic appropriately
// Evaluate the balance of computational and memory latency in the lifter application
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for the lifting operation for increased throughput
