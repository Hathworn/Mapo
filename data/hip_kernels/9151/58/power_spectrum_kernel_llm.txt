```c
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access in global memory
// Use additional shared memory to preload values for each thread block
// Avoid redundant __syncthreads() calls by optimizing data dependency
// Ensure shared memory size is correctly configured to avoid bank conflicts
```
