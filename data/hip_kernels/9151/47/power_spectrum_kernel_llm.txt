```
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Import data into shared memory to take advantage of memory coalescing
// Optimize the use of shared memory to improve access times and reduce latency
// Ensure shared memory access patterns are efficient for all threads
// Use shared memory instead of directly accessing global memory to minimize latency
