// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory regions
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize divergent branches within loops by ensuring all threads execute similar paths
// Perform loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
