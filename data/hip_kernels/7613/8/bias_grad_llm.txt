// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing pre_grad with consecutive thread indices  
// Minimize thread divergence by checking boundary conditions outside the loop  
// Use shared memory if possible to further reduce global memory access  
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and bandwidth  
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
