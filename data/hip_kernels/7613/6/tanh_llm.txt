```
// Consider coalescing memory access by using a 2D grid/block.
// Use shared memory to store 'bias[i]' values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Launch kernel with a block size that maximizes warp utilization.
// Consider aligning data structures to 32-byte boundaries for better memory access performance.
