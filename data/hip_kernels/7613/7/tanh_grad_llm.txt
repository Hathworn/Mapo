```c
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes.
// Implement shared memory usage to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure that 'cols' aligns with warp size for better performance.
// Utilize loop unrolling explicitly to leverage compiler optimizations further.
// Investigate occupancy issues by optimizing block and thread dimensions.
