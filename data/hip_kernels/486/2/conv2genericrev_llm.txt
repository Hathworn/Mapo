```
// Use shared memory to store partial convolution results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for input and kernel for better performance.
// Consider using padding to align memory accesses and reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead where possible.
// Reuse loaded values from shared memory to minimize redundant accesses.
// Strive to maximize occupancy by optimizing block size and use of shared memory.
