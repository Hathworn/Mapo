```
// Use shared memory to cache intData values for better memory access patterns
// Improve data locality by processing consecutive global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to intData for improved bandwidth usage
// Use loop unrolling for reducing loop overhead in frequently accessed sections
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce thread divergence
