```
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated intData accesses
// Minimize branch divergence by refactoring conditional logic
// Prefetching into registers from global memory to reduce latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern in global memory reads
// Combine arithmetic operations to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Use loop unrolling for fixed-size loops for better performance
