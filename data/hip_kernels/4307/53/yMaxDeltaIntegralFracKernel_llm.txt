```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Implement loop unrolling to further optimize memory access patterns.
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers to increase data reuse.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations where possible.
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring that threads within a warp take the same execution path.
