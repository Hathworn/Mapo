```cpp
// Precompute indices and fractions to minimize redundant calculations
// Use threadIdx for better parallelization and memory access pattern
// Precompute often accessed elements like corners to reduce memory access
// Ensure mathematical operations like min/max are minimized in execution path
// Leverage conditional operators to handle out-of-bounds memory access
```
