```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by reorganizing data layout
// Minimize divergent branches, especially in the nested conditions
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by adjusting memory access patterns
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data such as xMin, xMax, yMax
// Pre-fetch input data using shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Avoid recalculating constant expressions inside loops or conditionals
