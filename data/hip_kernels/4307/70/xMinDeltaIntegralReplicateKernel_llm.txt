```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for intData to improve cache utilization.
// Pre-calculate expressions involving repetitive access to reduce computation overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for tmpArray and intData to maximize bandwidth efficiency.
// Investigate use of shared memory for window-based calculations to reduce global memory traffic.
// Verify if loop unrolling techniques can be applied to the conditional multiplication section.
// Assess the impact of pre-fetching xMin, yMin, and yMax values to minimize latency.
