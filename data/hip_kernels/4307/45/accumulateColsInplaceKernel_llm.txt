```
// Optimization: Consider using read-only data cache for input values
// Optimization: Minimize thread divergence by ensuring colIdx calculations are consistent
// Optimization: Use atomics for sum reduction when utilizing shared memory across blocks
// Optimization: Ensure shared memory usage doesn't exceed limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimization: Verify alignment of memory accesses to improve coalesced reads
