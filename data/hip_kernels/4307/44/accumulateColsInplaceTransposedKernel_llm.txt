```
// Use memory coalescing to optimize global memory access
// Ensure warp alignment to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Explore shared memory usage to reduce repeated global memory reads
// Verify if loop unrolling can benefit performance for this particular kernel
// Consider asynchronous copy operations where possible to overlap computation and memory transfer
```
