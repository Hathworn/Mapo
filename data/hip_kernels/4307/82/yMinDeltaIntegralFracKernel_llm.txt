```
// Avoid calculating indices and bounds checks multiple times, compute them once and reuse.
// Use shared memory to cache data for fast access within a block.
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel to reduce divergence.
// Prefer registers over local memory for frequently accessed variables.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to optimize bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure data alignment for efficient memory access.
