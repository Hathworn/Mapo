```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning input and output pointers
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Use __syncthreads() to prevent data hazards when accessing shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for the loop iterating over 'w' to improve performance
// Allocate and use shared memory efficiently to prevent bank conflicts
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring memory accesses are coalesced
