```cpp
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to tmpArray to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Prefetch input data into registers to minimize memory latency
// Optimize the memory access pattern for intData to improve cache hit rate
// Minimize divergent branches caused by conditional statements within the kernel
```
