```
// Consider coalescing memory access to intData to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to temporarily store intData values for faster access.
// Ensure data alignment for intData and tmpArray to reduce access latency.
// Minimize register usage by optimizing loop unrolling and variable usage.
// Consider computing indices outside the loop to reduce redundant calculations.
