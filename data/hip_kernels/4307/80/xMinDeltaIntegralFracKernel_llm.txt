// Avoid repeated calculations to enhance memory access efficiency
// Implement shared memory for repeated data access within a block
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to further optimize execution performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global data pointers like intData and inData
// Consider using vectorized data types like float4 for accessing multiple data points simultaneously
