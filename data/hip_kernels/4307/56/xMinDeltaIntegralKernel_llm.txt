```c
// Reduce shared memory usage by optimizing access patterns.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed static data, if possible.
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for intData to improve performance.
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel execution.
// Pre-compute and reuse index calculations to reduce redundancy.
// Optimize the use of registers to minimize memory bandwidth usage.
