```
// Use shared memory to cache portions of inData and intData to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using __ldg() to leverage hardware read-only cache for read-only data like xMin, yMin, and yMax.
// Optimize thread block size to ensure maximum occupancy while keeping memory access coalesced.
// Minimize redundant calculations within the loop, for example, common subexpression elimination.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to achieve coalesced memory reads and writes.
// Consider loop unrolling for small loops to reduce the overhead of loop control.
