```
// Consider using shared memory for intData to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory access patterns for intData and tmpArray for better performance
// Minimize divergent branches by arranging conditions to favor warp execution
// Use const memory for frequently accessed read-only data like xMin, xMax, and yMax
// Pre-compute and store frequently accessed values outside of critical loops
// Reduce the use of floating-point operations like ceil and floor in kernel
