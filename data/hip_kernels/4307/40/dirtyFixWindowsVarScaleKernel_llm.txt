// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for arrayMin and arrayMax to improve performance
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same array elements to reduce global memory access latency
// Evaluate loop unrolling techniques to minimize loop overhead and increase efficiency
// Analyze the use of warp-level primitives to synchronize threads and optimize memory transactions
