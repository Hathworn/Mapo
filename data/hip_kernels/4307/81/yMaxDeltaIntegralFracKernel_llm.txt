```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning memory reads according to warp size.
// Minimize divergent branches by using conditional assignments instead of multiple if-statements.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory load operations.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce the number of loads from global memory within loops.
// Ensure that writes to tmpArray are coalesced to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize access patterns to inData by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory.
