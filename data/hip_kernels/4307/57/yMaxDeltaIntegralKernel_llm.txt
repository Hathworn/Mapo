```
// Use shared memory to cache intData block values for faster access.
// Consider loop unrolling for reducing instruction overhead.
// Replace division/modulus computations with pre-calculated values when possible.
// Perform memory coalescing by aligning data accesses to contiguous memory blocks.
// Pre-fetch data for the next computation to hide memory latency.
