// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as inData to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize condition checks within the main loop for better performance
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning data structures properly
// Consider using constant memory for read-only data such as xMax, yMin, and yMax
// Optimize stride indices to ensure thread blocks access memory contiguously
