```
// Use tiled memory access patterns to minimize global memory transactions.
// Consider coalescing memory access for better global memory utilization.
// Explore shared memory usage to buffer parts of the data for reused access.
// Align memory operations to avoid uncoalesced memory loads and stores.
// Use compiler flags to unroll loops for performance in compute-bound sections.
// Optimize the block and grid size for full occupation of the device resources.
// Minimize divergence within warps by ensuring conditional branches are unified.
