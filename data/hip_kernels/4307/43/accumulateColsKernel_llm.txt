```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Avoid casting between float and double to improve memory coalescing.
// Ensure memory access patterns are contiguous to maximize coalesced access.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and load balancing.
// Evaluate unrolling the loop to improve instruction-level parallelism.
