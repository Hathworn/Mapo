```
// Use shared memory to cache res_stride for faster access
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction operations
// Ensure memory coalescing for reading src array
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Optimize index calculations to minimize arithmetic operations
// Ensure block and thread dimensions are optimal for GPU architecture
