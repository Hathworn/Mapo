```
// Consider using memory coalescing by ensuring data elements accessed by consecutive threads in a warp are adjacent.
// Use half2 or float2 for potential vectorization to improve memory throughput and arithmetic efficiency.
// Increase shared memory usage by expanding buffer size only if shared memory resources allow.
// Potentially unroll loops where possible to improve GPU execution efficiency.
// Ensure that __syncthreads() are necessary and correctly placed to avoid performance bottlenecks.
// Evaluate grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and performance balance.
