// Use shared memory to cache index values for reducing global memory access.
// Align data structures to 16 bytes to improve memory coalescing.
// Leverage asynchronous copy for memory operations.
// Consider using half-precision floats where applicable to reduce memory bandwidth demand.
// Evaluate using texture memory for potentially faster reads.
