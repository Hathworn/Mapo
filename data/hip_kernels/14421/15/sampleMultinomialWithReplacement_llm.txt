```
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing its occupancy to necessary threads
// Explore coalesced memory access for normDistPrefixSum to optimize data retrieval
// Use warp-level synchronization to reduce latency in binary search execution
// Limit the use of __syncthreads() to necessary synchronizations within warps
// Assess use of __shared__ memory to avoid bank conflicts during operations
// Reduce warp divergence by aligning thread operations within warp allocations
