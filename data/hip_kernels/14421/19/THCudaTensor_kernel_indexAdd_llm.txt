```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better memory bandwidth
// Minimize bank conflicts by carefully arranging shared memory access
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized within the loop for better efficiency
// Optimize use of registers by limiting the number of variables used
// Align data structures to 256 bytes to benefit from memory coalescing
// Use larger tiles for processing data to reduce overhead
// Consider using loop unrolling for outer loops to enhance performance
