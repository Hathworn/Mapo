```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Utilize unrolled loops for efficient memory access, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput
// Consider aligning input and kernel pointers within shared memory to prevent bank conflicts
// Ensure synchronization points are placed correctly to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency
// Explore potential loop transformations or vectorization techniques for better SIMD utilization
// Assess occupancy to balance between compute resource utilization and memory bandwidth efficiency
// Investigate the potential for memory coalescing to enhance memory access patterns and reduce transaction overhead
