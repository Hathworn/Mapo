```c
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequent data for faster access.
// Consider cooperative groups to optimize thread collaboration.
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing use of registers.
// Explore shared memory bank conflicts and reduce them.
// Optimize loop unrolling strategically to balance performance with register usage.
// Test different block and grid size configurations for peak performance.
// Use inline functions where applicable to reduce kernel launch overhead.
// Profile memory access patterns to identify bottlenecks.
// Reuse RNG states to improve randomness and reduce overhead.
