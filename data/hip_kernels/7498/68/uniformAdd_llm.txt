```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring data is accessed sequentially
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce latency and increase throughput
// Ensure uniform memory access pattern for improved performance
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Use memory prefetching to reduce global memory access latency
```
