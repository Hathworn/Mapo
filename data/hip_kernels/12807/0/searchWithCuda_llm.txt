```
// Use shared memory to store queryAtrib and currAtrib for faster access
// Employ coalesced memory accesses when reading from query and atribsValues
// Unroll the loop for comparing queryAtrib and currAtrib to reduce loop overhead
// Use atomic operations or reduction techniques if resultPossibilities might be updated concurrently 
// Optimize index calculations and avoid using pointers in the index expressions to prevent race conditions
