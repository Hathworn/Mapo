```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for threads within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branching within the kernel to optimize performance.
// Use `const` keyword for variables that do not change to help compiler optimization.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized data types (e.g., float4) for potential memory coalescing benefits.
