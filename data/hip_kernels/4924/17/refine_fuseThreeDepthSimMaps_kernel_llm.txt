```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like dpts and sims arrays
// Coalesced memory access can be optimized by ensuring sequential threads access successive memory locations
// Check if the data can be processed block by block to reduce global memory access
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could help reduce overhead and increase throughput
