```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for maskMap and fpPlaneDepthMap
// Minimize bank conflicts by optimizing shared memory use if applicable
// Evaluate whether memory access can be optimized using texture memory for read patterns
// Consider loop unrolling or reducing loop overhead if applicable
// Optimize synchronization points to minimize idle threads waiting
// Investigate potential use of asynchronous memory operations for improved performance
