```
// Use shared memory to reduce memory access latency by caching repeated data in sharedNumMax for faster access.
// Utilize __syncthreads() efficiently to ensure correct synchronization of shared data among threads within the same block.
// Optimize reduction operation by performing it in shared memory rather than global memory to minimize global memory transactions.
