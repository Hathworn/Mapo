// Consider increasing shared memory utilization for better data reuse
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from shared memory
// Evaluate optimal block and grid sizes for maximum concurrency
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Prefetch data into registers where possible to reduce latency
