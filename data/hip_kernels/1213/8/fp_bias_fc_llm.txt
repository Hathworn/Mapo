```
// Consider using shared memory if bias is reused multiple times within a block for better memory access pattern.
// Coalesced memory access pattern is already achieved due to simple linear indexing.
// Ensure that n_channel is a multiple of blockDim.x for efficient warp utilization.
// Profile the kernel to ensure maximum thread occupancy is achieved.
