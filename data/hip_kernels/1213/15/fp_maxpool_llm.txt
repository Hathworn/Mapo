```
// Consider using shared memory for the input array to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed variables such as kernel_size if their values remain unchanged.
// Align memory accesses to increase coalesced access patterns, optimizing memory throughput.
// Ensure the input data is aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
// Reduce the padding computation overhead by pre-calculating constants outside of kernel loops.
// Consider loop unrolling for better pipeline efficiency if the loop iteration count is known.
