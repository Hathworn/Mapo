```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns
// Optimize memory access by minimizing divergence and unnecessary calculations
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access when possible
// Ensure enough threads are used to fully occupy the GPU and hide latency
