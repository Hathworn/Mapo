```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache weights and inputs to reduce repetitive global memory access
// Implement loop unrolling further to enhance performance by decreasing iteration overhead
// Consider adjusting block size and grid size to better match the GPU architecture and workload
// Optimize the use of atomic operations to minimize contention and ensure efficient parallel execution
