```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring aligned access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Avoid redundant modulo operations to enhance performance
// Use float literal for more accurate computation
// Reduce global memory write operations by buffering values
// Investigate thread synchronization requirements
// Ensure coalesced memory access in global memory operations
```
