```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data accessed frequently
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate if split kernels can reduce execution time by processing outputs in separate kernels
// Profile kernel to verify and minimize branch divergence in conditional statements
// Use float4 or float2 for loading and storing data to potentially increase memory throughput
// Analyze occupancy and consider adjusting block size for optimal performance
