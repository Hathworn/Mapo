```
// Precalculate row and column to reduce redundant calculations
// Use linearized index to access input array to utilize coalesced memory access
// Larger block size could be used for better occupancy depending on hardware constraints
// Avoid branch divergence by simplifying output selection logic if possible
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced for optimal read/write performance
// Consider shared memory for buffering if required and beneficial
