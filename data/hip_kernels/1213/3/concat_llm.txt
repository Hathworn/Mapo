```
// Use optimized memory access patterns for better cache utilization
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data structures to warp boundaries to enhance coalescing
// Minimize divergent branches to reduce warp execution penalties
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to improve instruction throughput
// Analyze the impact of varying block size and grid size for performance tuning
