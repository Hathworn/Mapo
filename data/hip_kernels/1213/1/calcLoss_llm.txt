```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better bandwidth utilization
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use warp-level primitives if possible to optimize reduction operations
// Align block size and grid size to optimize for the GPU's occupancy
// Minimize thread divergence by reorganizing conditional calculations
```
