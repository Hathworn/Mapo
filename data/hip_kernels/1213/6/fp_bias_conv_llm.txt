```
// Consider using shared memory for bias if it fits to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing with appropriate stride for preact array
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access if shared memory is used
// Optimize memory access pattern for better cache utilization
// Use constant memory for bias if it does not change and is accessed frequently
