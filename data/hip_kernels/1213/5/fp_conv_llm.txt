```
// Ensure weights are loaded into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() after loading weights to synchronize threads
// Calculate global position 'pos' for each thread to enable parallel processing
// Use padding to simplify SAME padding calculations, avoiding unnecessary input checks
// Ensure shared memory for weights is large enough to accommodate all kernel loading
// Atomic operations used should ensure no race conditions occur during thread execution
// Consider unrolling loops for further optimization if necessary
// Limit the number of 'if' statements involving direct memory accesses
// Check for opportunities to reduce memory consumptions and enhance data locality
// Profile the kernel execution to identify bottlenecks specific to memory bandwidth
