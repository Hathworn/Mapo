```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache parts of weight and input for faster access.
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure aligned memory access for coalescing and improved bandwidth efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Explore using a half precision data type if precision requirements allow to reduce memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure enough threads per block to maximize occupancy and achieve better latency hiding.
