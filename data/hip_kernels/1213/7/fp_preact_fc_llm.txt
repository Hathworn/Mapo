```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input and weight data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Organize memory access to ensure coalesced loads and stores, which can improve performance on GPUs.
// Consider using warp-level primitives if possible for collective operations to improve efficiency.
// Ensure that the atomic operations are minimized as they can cause serialization and reduce performance.
// Evaluate the possibility of using half-precision arithmetic if applicable for improving performance and reducing memory usage.
