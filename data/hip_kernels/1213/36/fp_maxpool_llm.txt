```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning input and output arrays in global memory
// Reduce the overall number of thread synchronizations by minimizing diverging code paths
// Consider using shared memory to store partial results for further memory access optimization
// Leveraging vectorized loads/stores might improve memory throughput
// Use constant memory for kernel_size and padding if they are invariant across blocks
