```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_weight, d_preact, and p_output
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if applicable
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput
// Implement cache strategy if shared memory cannot fully optimize memory access patterns
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
// Evaluate warp-level synchronization to enhance parallel execution
```
