```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to enhance coalescing
// Analyze warp divergence due to conditional branches and manage accordingly
// Ensure memory access patterns leverage sequential access when possible
// Evaluate usage of shared memory to minimize global memory traffic
// Examine the kernel launch configuration for better occupancy
// Optimize stride calculation for more efficient loop execution
// Review batch index calculation to avoid potential redundant computations
