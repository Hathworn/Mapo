```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for weight calculations.
// Align memory access patterns to achieve coalesced memory access.
// Attempt loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Minimize usage of atomic operations, consider alternative reduction methods to optimize performance.
// Organize threads and data layout to maximize occupancy and warp efficiency.
// Evaluate if bank conflicts are minimized when using shared memory.
