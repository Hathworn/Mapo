```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Pre-calculate input index outside the loop to reduce redundancy.
// Reduce conditional checks within the loop where possible.
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Align input data to improve cache throughput and memory coalescing.
// Ensure the block size is a multiple of the warp size to maximize device utilization.
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditions.
