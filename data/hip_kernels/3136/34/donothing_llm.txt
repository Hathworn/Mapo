// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize data access patterns to ensure coalesced memory reads and writes.
// Minimize divergence within warp by ensuring threads follow similar execution paths.
// Evaluate thread block size to maximize warp occupancy and minimize idle threads.
