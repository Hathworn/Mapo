```cpp
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced by aligning memory layout.
// Minimize the use of global memory accesses - consider using shared memory for temporary storage.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce instruction overhead.
// Ensure efficient use of registers by minimizing register pressure within the kernel.
// Aim to balance computation and memory access to optimize for memory-bound or compute-bound performance.
// Consider using vectorized operations if supported by the architecture for higher throughput.
