```
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have written to shared memory before reading.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization on supported devices.
// If a and b will be used multiple times, consider loading them into shared memory.
// Examine if loop unrolling can be applied to further optimize performance.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures properly.
// Consider using constant memory for any read-only data if applicable.
