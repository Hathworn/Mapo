// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations.
// Optimize thread workload by balancing the loop iterations among threads.
// Consider using atomic operations for reducing synchronization overhead.
// Experiment with varying block and grid sizes to improve performance.
