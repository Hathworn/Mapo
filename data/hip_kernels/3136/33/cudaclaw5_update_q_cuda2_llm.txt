```
// Use shared memory to store fm, fp, gm, gp for faster access.
// Avoid bank conflicts by carefully aligning data in shared memory.
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers to reduce access latency.
// Use vectorized loads and stores if possible to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for qold, fm, fp, gm, gp arrays.
// Minimize arithmetic operations within the loop by factoring out computations.
// Use loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure that the loop bounds and strides align with memory caching strategies.
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous memory operations where applicable.
