// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory access by minimizing global memory fetches
// Coalesce memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure that variables such as flow_idx and image_idx are reused to avoid redundant calculations
// Utilize warp-level primitives for efficient parallelism
