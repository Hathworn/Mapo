```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage to fit block size and reduce bank conflicts.
// Use memory prefetching techniques to hide memory latency.
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced, especially for the src array.
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed iteration loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure that operations on shared memory are minimized to reduce contention.
// Optimize atomic operations to improve performance in critical sections.
// Reduce thread divergence by aligning conditions in if-statements.
