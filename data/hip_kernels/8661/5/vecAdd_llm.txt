```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access nearby memory locations.
// Prefetch data to optimize memory access latency.
// Minimize global memory accesses by using local variables for intermediate results.
// Ensure that data types are properly aligned to avoid memory access penalties.
