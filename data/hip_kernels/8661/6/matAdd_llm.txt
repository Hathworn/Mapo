```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory access efficiency.
// Ensure that the thread block dimensions are optimal for the hardware being used.
// Avoid using global memory pointers unnecessarily; use shared or register memory if possible.
// Review the possibility of aligning data structures to take advantage of memory bank optimizations.
// Minimize the use of indirect addressing by directly using local variables or constants when possible.
