```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring global memory accesses are contiguous
// Improve occupancy by adjusting block size and grid configuration
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads if necessary
// Utilize warp-level primitives for better performance
