```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Reduce global memory access by using registers for intermediate results.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for a, b, and c vectors to improve performance.
// Consider adjusting the block size and grid size for optimal occupancy.
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable to help the compiler with optimization.
