// Consider using shared memory to cache tiles of the input matrices a and b to reduce global memory access latency.
// Prefetch data to registers for loop invariant data to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures appropriately with block dimensions.
