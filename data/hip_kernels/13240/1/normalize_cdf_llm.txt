// Use __restrict__ to indicate no aliasing of pointers for better optimizations
// Minimize global memory accesses by using registers for intermediate computations
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need access to common data
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory for efficient memory access
