// Consider increasing the size of shared memory allocation based on maximum k for better utilization.
// Use shared memory for sub_searchPoints to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure synchronization after loading data into shared memory to avoid race conditions.
// Review memory coalescing, ensure referencePoints access is optimized for contiguous memory access.
