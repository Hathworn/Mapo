```
// Consider coalesced memory access for load/store operations to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory transactions
// Prefetch data from global memory into shared memory if re-using in multiple steps
// Use loop unrolling techniques for the innermost loop to reduce loop control overhead
