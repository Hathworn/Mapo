// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() after loading data to shared memory.
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce the number of loop iterations and increase execution speed.
// Consider the memory access pattern to maximize coalescing for referencePoints array.
