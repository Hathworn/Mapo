```
// Load searchPoints into shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory access
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently utilized and avoid bank conflicts
// Early exit when possible to reduce unnecessary computations
// Prefer loop unrolling for the innermost loops to enhance performance
// Optimize data access patterns within loops for better cache utilization
