// Consider using shared memory to cache referencePoints for faster access
// Align data to memory boundaries to minimize uncoalesced accesses
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimal and coalesced
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency
// Evaluate using float4 data type for potential register usage reduction and efficiency
