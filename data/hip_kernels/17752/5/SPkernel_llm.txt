// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for reference points.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for both searchPoints and referencePoints.
// Reduce __syncthreads() calls where possible to avoid thread synchronization overhead.
// Optimize thread usage to ensure warp-level execution whenever feasible.
