// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when accessing referencePoints
// Consider coalesced memory access for sub_searchPoints to improve memory throughput
// Utilize vectorized memory access patterns for sub_searchPoints and referencePoints
// Minimize redundant calculations within the loop to reduce computational overhead
// Consider loop unrolling for the computation within the for-loop to enhance performance
