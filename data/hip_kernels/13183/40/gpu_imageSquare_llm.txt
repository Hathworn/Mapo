// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize block dimensions to maximize occupancy and reduce warp divergence
// Consider using a coalescing access pattern for the input array
// Ensure memory access is aligned to improve data throughput
// Minimize data transfer between device and host, if applicable
