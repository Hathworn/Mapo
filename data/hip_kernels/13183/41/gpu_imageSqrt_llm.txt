// Consider coalesced global memory access to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to parallel data loading for neighboring blocks.
// Investigate potential loop unrolling for operations within each block for efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() sparingly to minimize stalls and performance bottlenecks.
