```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to cache mask data for each block if possible
// Consider vectorizing loads and stores to improve memory throughput
// Align memory accesses and ensure memory is properly aligned
// Optimize thread block size for better utilization of memory bandwidth
// Minimize synchronization points within the kernel to reduce overhead
// Ensure enough thread occupancy to hide latency of memory operations
