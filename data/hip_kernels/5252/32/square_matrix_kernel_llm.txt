// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for feats array
// Consider memory coalescing techniques for improved access speed
// Evaluate using texture memory for repetitive read patterns
// Implement loop unrolling inside the kernel
// Optimize block size and grid size based on hardware resources
// Experiment with half-precision floating points if possible for reduced memory bandwidth
