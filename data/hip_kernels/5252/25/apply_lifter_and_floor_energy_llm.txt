```cpp
// Use shared memory to store lifter coefficients for reducing global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling for warp-level parallelism
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block when modifying shared data
// Prefer __fmul_rn for more accurate floating-point multiplication if precision is critical
```
