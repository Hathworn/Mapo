```
// Consider using shared memory to store Ar and Aw for faster access.
// Unrolling the loop further if register pressure allows.
// Utilize float2 to improve vectorized operations and coalesced memory access.
// Prefetch data to shared memory or registers to hide memory latency.
// Separate the handling of boundaries to reduce branch divergence.
