```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp efficiency
// Optimize memory access by using __restrict__ for pointers if applicable
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization to maintain parallel execution efficiency
