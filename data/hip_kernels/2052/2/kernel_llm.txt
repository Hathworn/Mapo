```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better memory utilization.
// Ensure that adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts if shared memory is used.
// Use registers efficiently to reduce global memory access.
// Balance the workload among threads to avoid divergence.
// Profile the kernel to identify and address any further bottlenecks.
