```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data for threads in a warp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses when possible
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider using registers to reduce latency where appropriate
// Optimize data access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Align memory accesses to avoid misaligned loads and stores
