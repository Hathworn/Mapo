```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Consider using __shared__ memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp have similar execution paths
// Use warp shuffle or parallel reduction techniques to optimize intra-warp operations
