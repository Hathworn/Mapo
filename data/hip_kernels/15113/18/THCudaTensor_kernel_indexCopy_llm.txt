```
// Optimize memory access patterns to coalesce global memory access.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce memory traffic.
// Consider block size and grid configuration for better occupancy and performance balance.
// Use __syncthreads() carefully to synchronize threads without causing unnecessary overhead.
// Ensure data alignment for faster memory access and operations.
// Minimize branching and divergence within kernels to maintain efficiency.
// Reduce register usage per thread to maximize occupancy and parallel execution.
