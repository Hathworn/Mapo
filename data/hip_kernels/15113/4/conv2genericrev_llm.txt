```c
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for input, kernel, and output arrays
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Merge loops to improve memory access patterns and data locality
// Balance the workload among threads using batch, kid, and nkids variables
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads work on adjacent elements
// Use __syncthreads() carefully to avoid write-after-read hazards
// Optimize thread block dimensions to fully utilize shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for small kernel sizes to reduce loop overhead
