// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for res_stride.
// Ensure thread blocks are fully utilized for better performance.
// Consider aligning data accesses for coalesced memory transactions.
// Reduce the number of atomic operations when possible to minimize contention.
// Use constant memory for index array if dimensions are known beforehand.
