// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Improve data locality by accessing shared memory instead of global memory
// Minimize global memory access to improve performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns in shared memory usage
// Reduce thread divergence in conditional statements
// Balance shared memory usage with register allocation
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions
