```c
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing for accessing 'row[i]' to enhance memory performance
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to reduce shared memory bank conflicts
// Optimize the use of shared memory by reducing its usage to a necessary minimum
// Consider unrolling the inner for-loop to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Evaluate if the use of 'pow(fabs(row[i]), value)' can be optimized for common cases
// Assess potential benefits of employing atomic operations for reduction in some scenarios
