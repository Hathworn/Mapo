```c
// Optimize memory access by aligning data structures to improve coalesced access.
// Use shared memory to store portions of normDistPrefixSum for faster access if possible.
// Employ __syncthreads wisely to reduce idle time spent while ensuring correct data access.
// Reduce the number of computations in frequently called functions by pre-computing constant expressions.
// Try to minimize warp divergence by ensuring that all threads in a warp follow similar execution paths.
