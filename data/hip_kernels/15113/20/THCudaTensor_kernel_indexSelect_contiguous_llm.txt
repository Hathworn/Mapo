```
// Consider increasing the VT (vectorization factor) for better memory coalescing in appropriate scenarios
// Use shared memory to cache index values to reduce redundant global memory reads
// Ensure idxSize is small enough for efficient use of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory
// Implement memory coalescing to improve global memory bandwidth utilization
// Employ unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enhance parallel execution of memory operations
