```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and store frequently accessed variables
// Minimize divergence by combining conditions where possible
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads update shared memory before any global writes
// Implement atomic operations or reductions to efficiently update shared variables
```
