// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for 'cross_edges' and 'indices' arrays.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring warp synchronous execution.
// Leverage shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure 'atomicExch' operation is necessary to prevent redundant overhead.
