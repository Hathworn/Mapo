// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data such as parent values to reduce global memory accesses.  
// Aggregate repeated memory writes, especially for the flag and parent arrays, to minimize atomic operations and memory bandwidth usage.
// Optimize usage of __syncthreads() by ensuring threads are not waiting unnecessarily, potentially using warp-level primitives for synchronization.
