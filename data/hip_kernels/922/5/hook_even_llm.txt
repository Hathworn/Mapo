```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize the number of accesses to global memory.
// Initialize shared memory to track if any updates occur within the block.
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory is correctly initialized.
// Use a stride loop to ensure coalesced access to global memory.
// Deactivate edges directly within the loop to reduce further checks.
// Update the global flag only once per block to reduce global memory writes.
