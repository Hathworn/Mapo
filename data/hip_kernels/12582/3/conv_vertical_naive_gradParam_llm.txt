```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for dy and x arrays to improve bandwidth efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory for the x array to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Explore warp-level primitives for further optimizations in reduction operations.
// Investigate double buffering to hide memory latency when accessing global memory.
