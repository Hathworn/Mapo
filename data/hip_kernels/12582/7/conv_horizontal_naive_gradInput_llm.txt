```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache portions of w or dy if they are repeatedly accessed.
// Ensure dx is aligned to avoid misaligned memory accesses.
// Evaluate if accessing dy in a coalesced manner is possible for incremental memory throughput.
// Investigate whether loop unrolling can be employed to optimize the inner loop.
