```
// Consider using vectorized memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase parallelism.
// Assess the shared memory bank conflicts for shared_w and optimize if necessary.
// Consider double-buffering technique to optimize the shared memory utilization.
// Load weights in coalesced manner to improve global memory bandwidth.
