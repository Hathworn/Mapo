// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for better performance on AMD GPUs.
// Use shared memory for weight data to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize loop limits using integer arithmetic to minimize conditional checks.
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores, if alignment permits, for faster data throughput.
// Ensure memory alignment for dy and dx arrays to utilize faster memory access patterns.
