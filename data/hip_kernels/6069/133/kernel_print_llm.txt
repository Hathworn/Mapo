// Consider using shared memory for caching frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize the use of printf within the kernel as it can severely impact performance.
// Evaluate if computing results outside the kernel can reduce workload within the kernel and enhance performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimizing global memory access.
