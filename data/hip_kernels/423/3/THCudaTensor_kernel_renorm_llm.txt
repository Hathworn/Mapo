```
// Consider using shared memory and strided access to enhance memory coalescing.
// Minimize thread divergence within the reduction loop by ensuring all threads reach synchronization points.
// To optimize bank conflicts in shared memory, utilize padding or align data appropriately.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations for reduction to allow finer granularity in parallel accumulation.
// Restrict calculations inside conditionals to the warp level to maintain coherence in execution.
