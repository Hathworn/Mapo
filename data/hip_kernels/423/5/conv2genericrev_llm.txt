```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Using shared memory effectively can reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed the hardware limits to avoid performance degradation.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring proper access patterns.
// Utilize more parallelism by ensuring all available threads are actively working.
// Balance the workload among threads to prevent any thread from becoming a bottleneck.
// Ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency.
