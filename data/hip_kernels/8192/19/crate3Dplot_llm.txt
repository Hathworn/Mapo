```
// Consider using shared memory to store topVertices for better cache efficiency.
// Reuse computed indices like patchX and patchY to minimize redundant calculations.
// Unroll small loops like those for assigning topVertices to improve performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses while reading and writing vertexData for better performance.
// Avoid recalculating 'size' in multiple locations by storing it in a shared variable.
// Use a constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data like maxValue.
