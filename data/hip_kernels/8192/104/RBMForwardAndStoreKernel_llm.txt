```
// Consider coalesced memory access for outputPtr, weightPtr, and biasPtr
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access for inputPtr
// Optimize memory access patterns for dropoutMask for better cache utilization
// Minimize control divergence by potentially reordering condition checks
