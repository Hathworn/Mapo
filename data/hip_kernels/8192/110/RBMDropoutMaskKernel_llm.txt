```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for maskPtr
// Use constant memory for dropout if it is read-only
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by choosing optimal block size
// Utilize shared memory if there are any redundant memory accesses
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
```
