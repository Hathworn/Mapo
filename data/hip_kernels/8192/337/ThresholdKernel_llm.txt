```
// Consider coalescing access to input and output arrays
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for input and output pointers if applicable
// Place delta in shared memory to reduce redundant calculations
// Ensure delta computation occurs only once per block
// Reduce branching where possible, specifically in switch-case
// Ensure memory reads and writes are contiguous to improve throughput
