// Consider coalescing memory accesses in global memory to improve cache utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses and improve read efficiency.
// Evaluate using texture memory or warp shuffling for optimized data fetching.
// Align memory accesses to boundary conditions to enable memory access patterns.
