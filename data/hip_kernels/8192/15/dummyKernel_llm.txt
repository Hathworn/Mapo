```
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory latency
// Minimize divergent branching to maintain warp efficiency
// Align data access to warp boundaries when possible
// Consider using vector types to improve memory throughput
