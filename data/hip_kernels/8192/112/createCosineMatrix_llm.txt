```
// Optimize memory access pattern to improve coalesced access and reduce bank conflicts.
// Consider preloading constant values to shared memory for frequently accessed variables.
// Ensure aligned memory access for improved performance on sequential data.
// Minimize divergence by restructuring conditions that execute on all threads similarly.
// Investigate vectorization options for parts of the compute that fit the pattern.
