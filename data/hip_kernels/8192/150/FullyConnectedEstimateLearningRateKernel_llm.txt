```c
// Precompute repeated divisions for efficiency
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data if possible
// Avoid branching within loops to improve performance
// Consider loop unrolling for the loop over prevLayerSize
// Minimize the use of global memory by caching repetitive data
```
