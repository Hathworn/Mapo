```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Align memory access patterns to minimize uncoalesced accesses
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and enhance instruction throughput
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce latency within inner loops
// Consider memory alignment and padding to improve access speed
