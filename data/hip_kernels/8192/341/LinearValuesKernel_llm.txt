// Consider using compile-time constants for repeated expressions (e.g., fmaxf(size - 1, 1)) to reduce computation overhead.
// Evaluate potential bank conflicts within shared memory access.
// Check if accessing output using (id + shift) % size could be optimized to prevent frequent modulus operations.
// Ensure memory coalescing in output array access for improved bandwidth usage.
// Investigate if prefetching techniques could further optimize memory reads.
