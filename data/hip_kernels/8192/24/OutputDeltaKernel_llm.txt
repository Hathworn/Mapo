```cpp
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Ensure outputDeltas, target, and outputActivations are stored in global memory in a coalesced manner
// Minimize memory transactions by using shared memory if possible
// Strive for warp divergence minimization by checking if D_OUTPUT_UNITS is a multiple of threads per block
