// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance
// Evaluate loading multiple data points per thread for improved utilization
// Consider loop unrolling for operations inside the conditional blocks
// Use texture memory for frequently accessed data to enhance cache performance
