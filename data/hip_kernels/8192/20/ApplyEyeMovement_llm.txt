```cpp
// Store stats[4] in a register to reduce memory access.
// Compute clampedX using intermediate storage to save repeated calculations.
// Use fmaxf and fminf to clamp values, reducing conditional branches.
// Precalculate combinedVariance to minimize redundant operations.
// Minimize the use of sqrtf by performing it only once when calculating variance.
// Conditional blocks should be minimized to improve warp execution efficiency.
