```cpp
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory access for 'dimensionWeight'.
// Consider coalesced access for 'difference' to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Explore using warp-synchronous programming in the reduction loop to minimize thread divergence.
// Optimize memory access patterns to benefit from L2 cache usage.
// Minimize bank conflicts in access to shared memory if it is utilized.
