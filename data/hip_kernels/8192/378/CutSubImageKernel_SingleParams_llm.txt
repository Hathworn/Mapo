```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Consider using __ldg to hint the hardware that the data is read-only
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning sequential threads with data elements
// Minimize divergent code by restructuring conditional branches
// Pre-compute repeated calculations outside of loops if applicable
// Explore launch configuration adjustments to maximize warp occupancy
