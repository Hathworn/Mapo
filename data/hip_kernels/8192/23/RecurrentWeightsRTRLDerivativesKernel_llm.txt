```
// Consider using shared memory to cache recurrentWeights and previousRecurrentWeightRTRLDerivatives for threads in the same block
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Pre-compute repeated global memory access results to reduce latency
// Employ asynchronous prefetching of data to hide global memory latency
// Minimize divergent branches within warp, especially in critical loops
