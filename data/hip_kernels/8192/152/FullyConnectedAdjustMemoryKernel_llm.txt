// Use shared memory to store avgWeightGrad data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for contiguous memory accesses
// Unroll loop to reduce overhead and improve performance
// Explore using cooperative groups for synchronization and better memory access patterns
