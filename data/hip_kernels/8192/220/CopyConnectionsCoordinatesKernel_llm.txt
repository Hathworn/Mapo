```
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access for connectionMatrix
// Prefetch pointsCoordinates to registers to minimize latency
// Avoid atomic operations by reducing contention, if possible
// Align memory accesses for better cache performance
// Evaluate warp occupancy to ensure efficient execution
