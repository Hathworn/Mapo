```
// Consider using vectorized memory operations to improve memory access efficiency
// Reduce redundant synchronization by reorganizing code or using warp-level primitives if applicable
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal and does not exceed block memory limits
// Prefetch data into shared memory or registers to hide memory latency
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block and grid sizes based on usage
// Look into utilizing async copy features for faster memory transfers if HIP supports it
// Evaluate the use of constant memory for frequently accessed constants like D_HIDDEN_UNITS
// Investigate if loop unrolling could benefit the inner loops for performance gains
