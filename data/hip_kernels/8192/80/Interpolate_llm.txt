```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if input arrays are accessed multiple times
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to maximize utilization of GPU resources
// Minimize divergent branches within warp to improve execution efficiency
// Consider using texture memory or read-only memory cache for read-only data access patterns
