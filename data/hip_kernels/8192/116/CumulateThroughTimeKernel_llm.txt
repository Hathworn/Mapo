```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance
// Minimize the use of local and register memory by reducing temporary variables
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure optimal block size and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy
// Unroll loops to improve instruction throughput
