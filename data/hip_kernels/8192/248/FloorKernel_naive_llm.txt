```
// Use grid-stride loop for better parallelism
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Optimize memory access by utilizing shared memory if possible
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory usage through padding
// Consider using __restrict__ pointer qualifiers to reduce pointer aliasing
