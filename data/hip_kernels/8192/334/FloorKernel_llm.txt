```cpp
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for input and output pointers to advise the compiler about no aliasing
// Optimize memory access by ensuring input and output arrays are aligned to 32-byte boundaries
// Consider using vectorized data types (e.g., float4) to process multiple elements per thread
// Evaluate performance benefits of using shared memory if access patterns allow
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having contiguous memory accesses to input and output arrays by adjacent threads
// Consider using memory prefetching techniques to hide global memory latency
// Explore warp shuffle operations if reductions or inter-thread communications are needed
// Assess the trade-offs of using more registers versus shared memory for temporary variables
// Use appropriate launch bounds to maximize GPU occupancy based on register and shared memory usage
// Test running the kernel with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration
