```
// Consider using shared memory to load texture data for coalesced access.
// Optimize memory access by aligning data structures to natural boundaries.
// Maximize occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size based on GPU architecture.
// Ensure efficient use of registers by analyzing thread divergence.
// Use texture caching if the texture data is static for improved cache efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive computations to reduce instruction count.
