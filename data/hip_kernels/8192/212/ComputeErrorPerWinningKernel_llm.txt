```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for localError, winningCount, and errorPerWinning arrays for better performance.
// Utilize shared memory if there are repeated accesses to winningCount or localError within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threadId conditions are as uniform as possible.
// Consider restructuring data or adjusting thread block layout to reduce global memory latency.
