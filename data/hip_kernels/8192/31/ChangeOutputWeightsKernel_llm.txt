```
// Consider using shared memory to cache hiddenActivations to reduce global memory access
// Use float2 or float4 types to load and store multiple weights at once for coalesced access
// Explore launching fewer blocks with more threads per block for better occupancy
// Evaluate loop unrolling explicitly if register pressure allows for it
// Assess the impact of using `__restrict__` pointers for potential compiler optimizations
