```
// Use shared memory to cache recurrentWeights and improve memory access speed
// Consider optimizing alignment of memory accesses for coalesced reads
// Evaluate opportunities to reduce global memory accesses by using registers
// Optimize memory access patterns for hiddenActivationDerivatives
// Use __restrict__ to inform the compiler of non-aliasing pointers
// Check if using texture memory could improve performance for read-only data
