// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring alignment of `activityFlag`, `connection`, and `age` arrays.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory load.
// Minimize warp divergence by consolidating conditional checks.
// Assess the benefit of reorganizing data structures to improve coalesced memory access.
// Implement a direct memory copy for `connection` and `age` arrays if data layout allows.
