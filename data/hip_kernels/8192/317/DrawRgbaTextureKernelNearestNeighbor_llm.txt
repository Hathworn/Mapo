```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access, especially for texture data.
// Optimize the memory access pattern by coalescing reads from global memory.
// Explore using constant memory if texture data does not change frequently.
// Ensure global memory access is aligned to improve load and store efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branches, particularly around condition checks.
