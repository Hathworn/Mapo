// Use shared memory for blocks to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider vectorized loads and stores to utilize memory bandwidth better.
// Align memory access, particularly if using a vectorized approach, to avoid misalignment penalties.
// Consider whether a loop unrolling technique could benefit this copy operation.
// Evaluate if coalesced memory access patterns can be improved to minimize bank conflicts.
