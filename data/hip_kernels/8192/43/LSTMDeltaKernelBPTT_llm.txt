```
// Reuse loaded data to reduce redundant memory accesses
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to optimize memory bandwidth
// Minimize loop body computations by storing repeated calculations in variables
// Optimize global memory accesses by coalescing memory reads and writes
// Pre-fetch data into registers when possible to reduce latency
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reducing and sharing data efficiently
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to avoid misaligned memory transactions
