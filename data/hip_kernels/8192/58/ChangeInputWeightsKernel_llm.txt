// Consider using shared memory for outputWeights to reduce global memory access latency
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for inputWeightRTRLDerivatives to improve memory throughput
// Ensure all loops are unrolled properly to maximize instruction throughput
// Evaluate using warp-level primitives for reduction to further enhance parallel efficiency
