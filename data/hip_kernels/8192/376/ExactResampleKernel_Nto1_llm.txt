```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for the input data
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory transactions
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling on outer loops as well for further performance gains
// Explore usage of texture memory or constant memory for read-only data like the input array
// Profile performance to identify if a larger block size improves occupancy and throughput
