// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure data is coalesced when reading target and outputActivations
// Consider loop unrolling if performance gains are noticeable
// Evaluate the need for __syncthreads() for data dependencies
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance
