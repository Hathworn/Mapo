// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Evaluate potential benefits from loop unrolling to optimize performance in compute-intensive sections.
// Implement memory prefetching if applicable to hide memory latency.
