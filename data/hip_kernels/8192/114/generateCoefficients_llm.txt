```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory access patterns.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by padding shared memory if necessary.
// Avoid redundant calculations for threadGlobalID by calculating once.
// Explore using shared memory to promote data reuse among threads.
// Assess opportunity to use texture memory for read-only data like 'noise'.
// Check if warp-level primitives can optimize intra-warp operations.
