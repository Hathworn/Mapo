```
// Consider using shared memory to cache OF_value for coalesced access
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing shared memory
// Ensure alignment for OF_value loads for efficient memory transactions
// Utilize __syncthreads() appropriately when using shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for performance improvement
