```
// Consider coalesced memory access for weightPtr
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for inputPtr
// Avoid branch divergence by reconsidering the use of if conditionals
// Optimize memory reads by ensuring continuous access patterns for outputPtr
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing benefits
// Utilize loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead in the summation operation
// Prefer accessing __constant__ memory for frequently accessed constants like sigma
