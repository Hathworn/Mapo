```
// Consider coalesced memory access for input and output arrays
// Optimize subImageDefs memory access by loading into local variables early
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed input image regions
// Minimize divergent branches in safeBounds condition
// Fuse multiple operations to reduce arithmetic operations
// Use loop unrolling if applicable in bilinear interpolation calculations
