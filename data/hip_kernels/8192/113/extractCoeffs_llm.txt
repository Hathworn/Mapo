// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Minimize divergent branching by simplifying the control flow within loops.
// Utilize warp shuffle operations if possible to optimize data exchange between threads within the same warp.
