```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for chromosomes array to enhance memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance in loops where applicable
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for GPU architecture
```
