```
// Reduce redundant memory access by using shared memory where applicable
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize repeated global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to improve performance
// Align data access to improve coalesced memory access
// Use float4 or appropriate vector types to enhance memory throughput
// Consolidate conditional checks to minimize branching within the kernel
