```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for frequently accessed elements.
// Check if the grid and block dimensions are optimal for the target hardware.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size to maximize parallelism.
// Utilize __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronization.
// Evaluate the use of registers for temporary variables to reduce memory access.
