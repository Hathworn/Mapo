```
// Consider using warp level primitives to reduce sync overhead.
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Use vectorized loads/stores if applicable for global memory accesses.
// Investigate using __ldg for read-only data from global memory if appropriate.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit performance in any sections.
// Assess if larger blocks would improve performance by increasing parallel work.
