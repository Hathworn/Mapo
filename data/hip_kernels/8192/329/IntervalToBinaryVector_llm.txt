```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using consecutive threads accessing consecutive memory locations
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for input and outputs pointers to help the compiler with aliasing assumptions
// Use shared memory if further optimization is needed for repeated data access across threads
// Minimize divergence by structuring conditions to reduce branch disparities among threads
// Double-check the memory alignment for outputs to maximize memory transaction throughput
// If possible, precompute 1.0f / steps once outside the kernel to save computation at each thread
