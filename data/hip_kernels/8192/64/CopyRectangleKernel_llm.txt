// Optimize: Ensure coalesced access to global memory for better memory throughput
// Optimize: Prefer using shared memory if repeatedly accessed data can be reused
// Optimize: Try to maximize the arithmetic intensity to hide memory latency
// Optimize: Consider loop unrolling for a small number of operations inside the loop
// Optimize: Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
