// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns when reading from and writing to global memory
// Use memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure maximum resource utilization
