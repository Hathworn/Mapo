// Consider using shared memory to cache winningFraction[] for faster access within block
// Ensure that biasTerm[] is correctly aligned to avoid uncoalesced accesses
// Evaluate using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to potentially improve memory access efficiency
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts when accessing winningFraction[]
