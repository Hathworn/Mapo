```
// Use shared memory to cache A data for better memory access patterns
// Coalesce global memory reads by aligning access across threads in a warp
// Minimize repeated computation of Acols * (int)col_id by precomputing it in a register
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring all threads in the warp have similar execution paths
