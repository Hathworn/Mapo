```
// Consider using shared memory to store min and max values if they are accessed frequently
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous elements in the input array
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit performance for this kernel
// Check alignment of data structures to leverage coalesced memory reads
// Minimize register usage to allow greater occupancy
