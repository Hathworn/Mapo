```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate if compute capability allows warp-level memory optimization.
// Check if loop unrolling could improve performance.
// Assess if using a specialized rolling kernel would be appropriate.
