```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Align memory accesses for optimal use of memory bandwidth
// Consider using shared memory if access patterns are complex or reused
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for specific GPU architectures
// Ensure enough threads are launched to cover the entire array size
