// Use shared memory to cache data if input matrix A is accessed multiple times to reduce global memory accesses.
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput where possible.
// Consider prefetching elements of matrix A to registers before computation to hide memory latency.
// Ensure appropriate grid and block sizes to maximize GPU occupancy and resource utilization.
