```
// Ensure inputs are coalesced by aligning data to SIMD width
// Minimize divergent branches by using more arithmetic operations
// Employ __restrict__ keyword for input and output pointers to avoid pointer aliasing
// Prefetch data into registers for the access pattern before the interpolation
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse to reduce global memory access
```
