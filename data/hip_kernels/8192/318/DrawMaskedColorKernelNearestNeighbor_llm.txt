```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed arrays.
// Coalesce memory accesses to global memory to increase memory throughput.
// Use texture memory for accessing texture data to take advantage of texture caching.
// Minimize divergent branching by reordering conditions or using bitwise operations.
// Ensure enough thread blocks to fully utilize GPU resources for better performance.
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory transactions between host and device.
// Consider loop unrolling in cases where iterative processing is required.
// Reduce arithmetic operations by pre-computing invariant expressions outside of loops.
