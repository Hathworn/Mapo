```
// Consider using shared memory for centroidCoordinates to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing for visField accesses by aligning memory access patterns
// Use texture memory for centroidCoordinates if there is spatial locality
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and resource utilization
