```
// Use shared memory for referenceVector to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize redundant global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing referenceVector access patterns
// Consider using float4 or float2 for vectorized memory operations where appropriate
