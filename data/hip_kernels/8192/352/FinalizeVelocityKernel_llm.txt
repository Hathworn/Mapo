```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize thread index calculation for faster memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Leverage __syncthreads() to synchronize shared memory access across threads
// Consider further minimizing shared memory usage for larger globalFlow arrays
