```
// Use shared memory to cache input elements for better memory access patterns
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by aligning input and output arrays
// Consider loop unrolling for small fixed sizes to improve throughput
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same path
