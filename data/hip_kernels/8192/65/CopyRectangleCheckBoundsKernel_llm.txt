// Consider optimizing for memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Leverage shared memory to minimize redundant reads from global memory and maximize data reuse.
// Evaluate the potential of using warp-level primitives to reduce divergent branching when checking bounds.
