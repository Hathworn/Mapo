```
// Avoid recalculating static_cast<float> for pointX and pointY, compute once and reuse.
// Consider using shared memory for centroidCoordinates to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and potentially increase performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory transactions.
// Check if reducing the number of operations per thread in the loop can improve performance.
// Analyze if warp-level primitives can be applied to further optimize the kernel.
