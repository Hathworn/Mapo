```
// Consider coalescing memory access for symbolVectors to improve performance
// Preload inputVector elements into shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Evaluate using float4 data types for faster memory loads and computations
// Consider aligning symbolVectors and inputVector to cache boundary for optimal memory performance
// Unroll the loop to reduce loop overhead if the symbolSize is known at compile time
