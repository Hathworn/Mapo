```
// Consider memory coalescing to optimize global memory access pattern.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Utilize vectorized data types for better memory throughput.
// Align data structures and memory allocations to avoid memory access penalties.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations when possible to reduce contention.
// Pre-fetch data into registers to minimize latency from global memory access.
// Replace float division or multiplication in loops with pre-calculated values if constant.
// Ensure proper grid and block configuration to achieve full GPU occupancy.
