```cpp
// Use shared memory for dir, negDir, and origin arrays to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditionals
// Prefetch superposition[i] into a register to reduce memory latency
// Combine addition operations to minimize the number of arithmetic instructions
// Consider loop unrolling for the for loop to reduce loop overhead
