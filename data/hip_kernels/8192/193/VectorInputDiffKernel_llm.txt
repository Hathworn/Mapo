```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for input and referenceVector to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory access for input and referenceVector.
// Ensure memory alignment to avoid bank conflicts and improve access speed.
// Explore using vectorized loads/stores if input and referenceVector are large to enhance performance.
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead if applicable.
