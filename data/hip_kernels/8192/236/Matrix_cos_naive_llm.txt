// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure aligned memory accesses to take advantage of memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access if applicable
// Check if using __restrict__ keyword can help in conveying no-overlap info
// Optimize thread and block configuration for better occupancy
