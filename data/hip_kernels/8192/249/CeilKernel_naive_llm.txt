```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in A
// Use shared memory to buffer data and minimize global memory reads
// Ensure that all memory accesses are aligned to improve performance
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize warp occupancy and memory bandwidth efficiency
// Use asynchronous memory transfers to overlap data transfer with computation if applicable
