// Consider using shared memory for common computations to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses for input and output arrays
// Ensure memory alignment to improve memory read/write efficiency
// Evaluate if using float2 or float4 types could provide vectorization benefits
// Profile to check memory bandwidth utilization and optimize warp occupancy accordingly
