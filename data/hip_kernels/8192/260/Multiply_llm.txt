// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and load balancing.
// Use shared memory if necessary to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure enough threads are launched to hide memory latency and maximize bandwidth usage.
