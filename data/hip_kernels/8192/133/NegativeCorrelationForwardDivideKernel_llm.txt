```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory where possible to minimize global memory access for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure memory alignment to improve coalesced memory access and reduce bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling would be beneficial given the structure and size of loops.
