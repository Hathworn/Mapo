```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better memory access patterns
// Analyze the necessity and impact of atomic operations on performance
// Investigate if shared memory can be used to reduce global memory access
// Review if loop unrolling could enhance performance within bounds checks
// Assess thread block size to ensure optimal occupancy and performance
