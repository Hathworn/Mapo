```
// Consider using shared memory for `pointsCoordinates` to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced accesses in `vertexData` to improve global memory throughput
// Avoid branching by using arithmetic operations where possible to determine `halfSide`
// Pre-compute reusable values like `textureAbsLength` and make use of `constant` or `shared` memory if applicable
// Optimize register usage by reducing the number of variables within kernel scope
