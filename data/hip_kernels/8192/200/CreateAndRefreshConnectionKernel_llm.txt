```c
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize branching by ensuring only essential conditional logic within kernel.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance.
// Use __syncthreads() if necessary to prevent race conditions with shared memory.
