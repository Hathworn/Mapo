```c
// Consider using shared memory for mask and maskNewIds loading to reduce global memory access latency
// Align the data access to coalesce memory transactions for mask and maskNewIds
// Employ vectorized memory access for mask and maskNewIds if possible
// Use shared memory instead of local arrays to store center_updates to improve memory performance
// Combine atomic operations if possible to reduce overhead and contention on centers
// Tune block and grid dimensions to balance load and reduce warp divergence
