```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache data if there are repeated accesses to global memory
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Adjust grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and workload balance
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if no aliasing is guaranteed
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives like __shfl_down for data sharing across threads in a warp
