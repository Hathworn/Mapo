// Consider coalesced accessing for filterPtr and weightPtr to enhance memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory to cache weights within blocks if accessed multiple times.
// Opt for loop unrolling if applicable, to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
// Ensure optimal block and grid size configuration to fully utilize the device.
