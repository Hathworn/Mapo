```
// Use shared memory to store segments of weight data to reduce global memory access.
// Unroll the loop to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Align data structures to ensure coalesced memory access patterns.
// Consider using half-precision floats if precision requirements allow for reduced memory bandwidth.
