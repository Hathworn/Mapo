// Optimization: Use shared memory for input and previousOutput to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimization: Use loop unrolling for weightId calculation to reduce instructions
// Optimization: Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory throughput 
// Optimization: Use atomic operations if necessary to avoid race conditions
