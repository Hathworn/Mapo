// Consider using shared memory to cache inputs if they are accessed multiple times
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure any shared memory operations are completed before use
// Perform memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses within the warp
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring branches are minimized
