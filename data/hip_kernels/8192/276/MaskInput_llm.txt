```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by arranging data in a structure of arrays if possible
// Optimize use of shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using texture memory for the mask if it exhibits spatial locality
// Leverage asynchronous memory prefetching to hide memory latency
// Evaluate using occupancy calculator to maximize active warps per multiprocessor
