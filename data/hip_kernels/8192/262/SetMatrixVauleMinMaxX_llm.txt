// Optimize memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Avoid branching by using arithmetic logic for boundary checks
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block
// Minimize divergence by ensuring warp-wide uniform control flow
// Use occupancy calculator to maximize resource utilization on target hardware
