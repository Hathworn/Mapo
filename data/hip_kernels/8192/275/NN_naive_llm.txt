// Consider using shared memory for B vectors to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider unrolling the loop within Dist_between_two_vec for better performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access for both A and B vectors to optimize bandwidth usage
// Use float4 or similar data structures for aligned memory data to reduce load/store instructions
