```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for weightsGradPtr and shiftedWeightsPtr
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data like avgWeightGradPtr and avgBiasGradPtr
// Consider using loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce overhead
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditionals
// Employ prefetching techniques for dropoutMaskPtr to minimize latency
