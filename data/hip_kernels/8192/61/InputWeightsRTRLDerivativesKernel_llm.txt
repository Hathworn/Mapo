```
// Consider using memory coalescing for `recurrentWeights` and `previousInputWeightRTRLDerivatives` to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring `D_HIDDEN_UNITS` fits within the available shared memory per block.
// Implement double buffering or loop unrolling in the `for` loop to further reduce latency in shared memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns for `sharedRecurrentWeights` and `sharedPreviousDerivatives` if possible.
// Check thread divergence conditions, especially in the calculation of `unitId == to`, to avoid warp inefficiencies.
