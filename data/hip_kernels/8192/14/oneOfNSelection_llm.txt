```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for buffer and index arrays
// Consider using shared memory for index to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure that index access is minimized to avoid performance degradation
// Evaluate the possibility of using warp-level primitives to optimize conditional logic
