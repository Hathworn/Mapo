```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth
// Load pointsCoordinates using fewer transactions by aligning memory accesses
// Precompute halfSide only when activityFlag[threadId] is non-zero to save calculations
// Leverage shared memory to cache frequently accessed data across threads within the same block
// Use texture cache to read pointsCoordinates if spatial locality and reuse high across threads in different blocks
// Explore using __ldg() for reading pointsCoordinates and activityFlag if accessed multiple times
// Unroll loops when populating vertexData for improved instruction level parallelism
// Investigate warp-level intrinsics for potential optimizations in vertexData calculations
