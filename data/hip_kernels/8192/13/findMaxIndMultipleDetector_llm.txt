```
// Consider using a reduction pattern to optimize shared memory access.
// Use block-wise reduction to reduce global memory access.
// Avoid atomic operations by using local threads calculations.
// Ensure memory coalescing while accessing input data.
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy.
