// Use shared memory to store portions of input data and reduce global memory access.
// Perform coalesced memory accesses and ensure aligned loads in both input and output arrays.
// Consider adjusting block size to optimize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Explore using float4 data type for loading and storing to enhance memory throughput.
