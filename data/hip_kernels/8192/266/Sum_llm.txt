```
// Ensure memory access coalescing by accessing consecutive elements.
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse if partial sums can be used.
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data to cache line sizes.
// Utilize vectorized loads if hardware supports it for better performance.
// Reduce global memory accesses by employing register tiling techniques.
