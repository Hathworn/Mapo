```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures
// Use memory padding if necessary to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Investigate warp-level primitives for potential optimization in data handling
