```
// Consider using shared memory to buffer input data for improved access times.
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable for repeated computations to reduce instruction overhead.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to improve access efficiency for global memory transactions.
// Pre-fetch necessary data to reduce memory access latency.
