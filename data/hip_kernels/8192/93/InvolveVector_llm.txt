// Consider using shared memory for intermediate storage to reduce global memory reads and writes.
// Try to coalesce memory access by aligning data layout with warp size.
// Ensure effective utilization of threads by minimizing idle threads; use padding or revisit thread distribution.
// Investigate and minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
