```
// Use shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns
// Consider using loop unrolling for the inner loop
// Minimize the number of times avgWeightGrad and avgWeightGradVar are accessed in global memory
// Evaluate the impact of changing the order of loops to improve coalesced memory accesses
// Profile kernel performance to identify bottlenecks and adapt thread/block configuration
