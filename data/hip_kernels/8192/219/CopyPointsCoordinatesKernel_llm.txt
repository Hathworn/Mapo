```c
// Consider using shared memory for pointsCoordinates to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations for pointsCoordinates.
// Explore the use of restrict keyword to provide compiler optimization hints regarding pointer aliasing.
// Assess if loop unrolling could be applied here to improve instruction-level parallelism.
