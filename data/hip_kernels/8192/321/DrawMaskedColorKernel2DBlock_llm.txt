```
// Consider using shared memory to cache texture data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing global memory in a contiguous manner within warps.
// Utilize the constant memory for static kernel input parameters to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize divergent branches by minimizing conditional statements within warps.
