// Use shared memory to store data that is accessed frequently
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Use texture memory for read-only data to improve cache performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads to access consecutive memory locations
// Fine-tune block size for optimal GPU utilization and efficient memory access
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
