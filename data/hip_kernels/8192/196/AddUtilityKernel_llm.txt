```
// Consider using shared memory for storing intermediate values to reduce global memory access
// Check if the threadIdx condition can be optimized to avoid divergent branching
// Ensure data is coalesced when accessing the distance and utility arrays
// Verify that memory access patterns are optimal with respect to cache line utilization
// Explore using atomic operations if utility[s1] could be updated by multiple threads
// If possible, eliminate or optimize synchronization points in the code
