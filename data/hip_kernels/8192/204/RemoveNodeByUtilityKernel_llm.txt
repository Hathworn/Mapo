```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Coalesce memory accesses to connectionMatrix and connectionAge arrays
// Consider using texture memory for read-only utility and localError arrays
// Minimize use of global memory by storing temporary results in registers
// Avoid divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
