// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing sequential memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently used data
// Use atomicAdd for updating outputPtr to avoid race conditions
// Evaluate using warp-level primitives to reduce divergence and increase throughput
