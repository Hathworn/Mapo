```
// Consider using shared memory to store input data for faster access within a block.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by careful data layout.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to indicate that input pointers do not alias for more efficient memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data accesses to warp size.
