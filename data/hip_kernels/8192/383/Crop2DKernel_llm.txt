```
// Consider using shared memory for tiles to optimize data reuse and reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning memory access with warp size.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for input and output pointers to assert no aliasing and enable additional compiler optimizations.
// Evaluate if using texture memory might provide performance benefits for 2D image data access.
