```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures optimally
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance in accessing weight data
// Optimize conditional statements to avoid divergence in warp execution
// Apply vectorized operations for better memory throughput if applicable
// Balance thread block dimensions to improve memory efficiency
