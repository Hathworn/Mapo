// Consider using shared memory to cache the input data for faster access.
// Explore texture memory to optimize read operations.
// Evaluate warp-level optimizations and coalescing memory access patterns.
// Reduce global memory access by minimizing redundant calculations.
// Investigate occupancy by adjusting block and thread dimensions to optimize resource usage.
