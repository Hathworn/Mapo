```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Minimize divergent warps caused by conditional statements.
// Prefetch row_id to a register before the loop to decrease redundant global memory accesses.
