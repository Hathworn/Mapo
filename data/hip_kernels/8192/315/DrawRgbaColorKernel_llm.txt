// Consider coalesced memory accesses for target array by adjusting thread layout or memory access pattern
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed texture data if possible
// Avoid recalculating frequently used constants like 'targetPixels' and 'texturePixels' inside loops
// Ensure the grid is configured to fully utilize the GPU's resources for given target dimensions
