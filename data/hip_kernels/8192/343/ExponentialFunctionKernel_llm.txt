// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced accesses to global memory
// Consider using shared memory for input if it leads to frequently reused data within a block
// Ensure that the input and output arrays are aligned to memory boundary for faster access
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce the loop overhead and improve throughput
