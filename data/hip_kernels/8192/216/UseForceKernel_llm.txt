```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory with continuous threads
// Minimize global memory transactions by utilizing shared memory where applicable
// Consider the use of float4 for vectorized memory access
// Align data structures to improve memory throughput
// Ensure grid and block dimensions align with device architecture for peak performance
```
