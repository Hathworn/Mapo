// Utilize shared memory for block-wise computations to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for optimal memory transactions.
// Use shared memory to create a tile and synchronize threads to reduce data dependency.
// Limit redundant global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers.
