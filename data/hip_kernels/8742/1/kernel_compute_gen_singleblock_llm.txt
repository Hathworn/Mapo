```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalescing memory access for matrix_src and matrix_dst to improve bandwidth.
// Investigate the use of texture or surface memory for read-only data to optimize access patterns.
// Use warp shuffle operations for aliveCells calculations to further reduce memory access.
