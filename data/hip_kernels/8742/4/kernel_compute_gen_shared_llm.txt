```c
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing the number of redundant loads.
// Preload boundary data to reduce conditional checks within threads.
// Ensure threadIdx.x-based conditions are minimized to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory.
// Prevent memory bank conflicts by carefully aligning shared memory accesses.
