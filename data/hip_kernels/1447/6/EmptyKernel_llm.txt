```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to take advantage of its fast access speed and reduce global memory transactions
// Align data structures to natural boundaries for improved performance
// Explore using half precision floating points if applicable to reduce memory usage
// Verify that the grid and block dimensions are optimally configured for the hardware
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to decrease loop overhead
