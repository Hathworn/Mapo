```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for better memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses to gradInput and gradOutput by indexing them appropriately
// Minimize the number of floor and float operations within the loop
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize loop unrolling for output_h and output_w to improve pipeline efficiency
// Reduce divergent branching within the conditional statements
