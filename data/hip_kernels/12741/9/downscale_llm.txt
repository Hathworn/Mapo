```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring gradInput_data and gradOutput_data are aligned
// Minimize divergence by structuring warp execution paths uniformly
// Reduce memory transaction overhead using shared memory if applicable
// Use loop unrolling techniques if scale_factor is known at compile time
// Optimize index calculations by reducing redundant arithmetic operations
```
