// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for input patches to reduce global memory latency.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring proper memory access patterns.
// Use coalesced memory access for loading input data into shared memory.
// Utilize vectorized operations for input patch processing if hardware supports.
// Optimize thread block dimensions to maximize warp utilization and reduce divergence.
// Reduce register pressure by refactoring loop structures and minimizing temporary variables.
