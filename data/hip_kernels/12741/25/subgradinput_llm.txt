```cpp
// Consider optimizing shared memory size based on actual usage.
// Evaluate if pre-fetching gradOutput using shared memory improves performance.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data to sharedGradOutput.
// Investigate if using float4 or float2 types for memory transactions increases coalescing.
// Evaluate the loop unrolling for maximum performance on nested loops.
// Consider align memory accesses for gradInput to prevent bank conflicts.
