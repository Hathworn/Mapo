// Reduce atomic operations by minimizing pointer arithmetic
// Try to improve memory coalescing for improved bandwidth usage
// Consider changing loop orders for better cache efficiency
// Avoid repeated calculations by storing results in local variables
// Possible enhancements by utilizing shared memory for reused data
