```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory accesses.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses and improve bandwidth usage.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses to enhance performance.
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized or optimized to reduce potential performance bottlenecks.
