// Consider using shared memory to store dp values temporarily for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by adjusting thread and block configurations
// Use more aggressive loop unrolling if D is a small constant to reduce loop overhead
// Explore using memory prefetching techniques to reduce latency during reads
// Align dp and cost_image memory allocations to prevent uncoalesced access penalties
