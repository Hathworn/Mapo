```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage of dp values to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access consecutive memory locations in dp
// Unroll the loop if possible to reduce the loop overhead
// Use warp shuffling operations to perform reductions across threads within a warp if applicable
// Ensure that memory accesses to dp and stereo_im are aligned for better performance
// Minimize register usage by optimizing temporary variables and calculations
