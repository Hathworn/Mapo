```
// Consider coalesced memory access to dp array for all threads in a warp.
// Use shared memory to store cost_image and dp data for the current row to reduce global memory transactions.
// Consider loop unrolling for the loop over depth to improve performance.
// Try to minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Evaluate if the number of thread blocks and threads per block provides optimal occupancy on the target device.
// Use texture or constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data like depth information if applicable.
