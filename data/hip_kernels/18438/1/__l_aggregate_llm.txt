```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data structures and memory access patterns.
// Minimize global memory accesses by increasing the use of shared memory where applicable.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to synchronize only when necessary, reducing idle time.
// Try increasing the use of registers by optimizing variable storage at the register level.
// Balance the workload among threads to avoid divergence and ensure efficient warp execution.
// Optimize loop unrolling where appropriate to enhance throughput and reduce branching.
// Align data through padding or memory alignment techniques to improve memory bandwidth.
// Ensure shared memory is accessed in a coalesced fashion to take full advantage of memory bandwidth.
