```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store cost_image and dp to reduce global memory access
// Align memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction of prev_min
// Minimize divergent code within the kernel to optimize performance
// Balance compute and memory operations to avoid bottlenecks
// Consider fusing multiple kernel launches if data reuse is high
