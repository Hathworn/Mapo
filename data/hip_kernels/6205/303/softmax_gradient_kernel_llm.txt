```cpp
// Consider using shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Explore the use of warp shuffle operations to optimize warp-level reductions
// Try minimizing the use of __syncthreads() for better occupancy
// Ensure that the warp-level reduction assumes blockDim.x is a multiple of 32
// Evaluate if using cooperative groups for reduction could yield performance gains
