// Ensure data is aligned for coalesced memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if applicable.
// Consider occupancy optimization for better resource utilization.
// Adjust grid and block size for optimal load balancing.
// Prefetch data to reduce access latency if needed.
