// Consider using shared memory for data that can be reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve efficiency.
// Assess the use of atomic operations for updates to minimize race conditions.
// Evaluate occupancy by adjusting block size and threads per block to improve utilization.
