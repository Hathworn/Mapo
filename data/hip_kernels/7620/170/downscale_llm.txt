```
// Consolidate the scale factor multiplication outside the loops to reduce redundant calculations
// Use atomic operations to ensure thread safety during updates on shared memory
// Minimize thread divergence by maintaining uniform execution paths for warps
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads and writes
// Consider prefetching data to reduce latency in memory access
