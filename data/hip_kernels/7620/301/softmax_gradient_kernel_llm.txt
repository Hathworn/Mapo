```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Consider using float4 for coalesced memory access if dim is a multiple of 4.
// Align memory accesses to ensure coalescing and reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Use loop unrolling in the reduction phase to minimize loop overhead.
// Adjust block size for optimal occupancy and performance balance.
