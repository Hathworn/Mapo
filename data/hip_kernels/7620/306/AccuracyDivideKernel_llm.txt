```c
// Consider loading N into a register if it's used multiple times in a larger kernel
// Ensure *accuracy is not frequently accessed by multiple threads to avoid contention
// Prefetch data into shared memory if multiple threads need the same data
// Make sure the memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce global memory accesses when applicable
```
