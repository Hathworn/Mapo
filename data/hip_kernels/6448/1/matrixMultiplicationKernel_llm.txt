// Optimize using shared memory for faster access compared to global memory.
// Ensure As and Bs arrays are optimized to fit in shared memory per block.
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory.
// Tile loop should account for out-of-bound indices, preventing invalid memory access.
// Consider additional memory coalescing optimization for global memory access.
