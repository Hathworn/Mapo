// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for d_energy and d_fatigue by arranging data in a sequential manner.
// Consider using shared memory to cache d_energy and d_fatigue for reducing global memory accesses.
// Reduce divergent branches by refactoring or reviewing condition computations within the ternary operator.
// Check for optimal block and grid size configuration for enhanced occupancy and reduced warp divergence.
