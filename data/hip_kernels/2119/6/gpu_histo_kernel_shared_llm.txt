```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when reading from global memory
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing unnecessary shared memory operations
// Consider using loop unrolling to improve performance in the histogram accumulation
// Evaluate the impact of using tiling techniques to reduce global memory access times
// Consider the use of warp-level primitives for more efficient atomic operations
