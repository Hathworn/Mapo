```
// Consider using shared memory to cache Source values for each tile to reduce global memory loads.
// Optimize the calculation of gx and gy by minimizing repeated memory accesses.
// Experiment with coalesced memory access patterns for Source to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Preload shared memory before the computation loop to improve performance.
