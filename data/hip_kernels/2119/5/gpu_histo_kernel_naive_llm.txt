```
// Consider using shared memory for histogram bins to reduce global memory access.
// Implement warp-level atomic operations to improve efficiency on histogram updates.
// Explore cooperative groups for better handling of thread collaboration.
// Ensure coalesced access to the Source array to maximize memory throughput.
// Use multiple partial histograms per block and combine them at the end to minimize atomic collisions.
