// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency
// Balance workload among threads by adjusting block size and grid size to optimize occupancy
// Explore using vectorized operations if supported by hardware for better throughput
