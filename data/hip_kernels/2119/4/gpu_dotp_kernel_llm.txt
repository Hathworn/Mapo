```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Synchronize threads to ensure all operations on shared memory are complete
// Perform in-block reduction to minimize global memory use
// Use atomic operations sparingly to reduce contention
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
