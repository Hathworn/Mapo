```cpp
// Use shared memory to store curandState if multiple accesses happen within a block
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for better global memory throughput
// If applicable, use warp-shuffle operations for intra-warp random number generation
// Ensure memory alignment to maximize memory throughput
```
