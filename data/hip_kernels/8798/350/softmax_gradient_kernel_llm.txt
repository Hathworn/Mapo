```
// Consider aligning data accesses for coalescing
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Reduce the use of shared memory by using warp-level primitives
// Minimize the number of synchronizations for efficiency
// Optimize the reduction process by leveraging warp shuffle operations
// Implement loop unrolling if dim is known to improve performance
