```
// Consider using shared memory for gradOutput_data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to gradOutput_data for improved memory throughput
// Optimize thread block size and shape for better occupancy and warp efficiency
// Evaluate the impact of using vectorized loads/stores for gradOutput_data if applicable
// Consider merging small kernels if kernel launch overhead is significant
