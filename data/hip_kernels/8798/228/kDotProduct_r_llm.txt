```
// Use coalesced memory accesses when possible to optimize global memory access.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by minimizing thread divergence.
// Avoid redundant synchronization by ensuring threads are properly grouped and utilizing warp shuffle.
// Implement loop unrolling for reducing latency and increasing throughput.
