// Use shared memory for row_sum and col_sum to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalesced access patterns for row_sum and col_sum to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize the loop by unrolling to improve ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Ensure output access is coalesced for efficient memory writes.
