```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Increase block size if occupancy allows for more parallelism
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing data or conditions
```
