```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring access patterns are well-aligned.
// Use warp-level primitives if possible to reduce shared memory use and improve performance.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the specific hardware's occupancy and resources.
// Use double buffering in shared memory to overlap computation and memory accesses for better performance.
