```
// Consider using cooperative groups for more flexible synchronization patterns.
// Use persistent threads to reduce kernel launch overhead.
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts.
// Efficiently utilize vectorized memory accesses if possible.
// Review warp divergence and ensure memory accesses are coalesced.
// Look into doubling blockDim size to enhance parallelism.
