```
// Consider implementing shared memory usage to cache repeated data reads from global memory
// Optimize with loop unrolling to increase pipelining efficiency in the inner loop for 'j'
// Use __restrict__ qualifier on pointer arguments to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Evaluate benefits of using warp synchronous methods for reduction of `sum` variable
// Analyze if coalesced memory access patterns can be applied for gradOutput_data read operations
