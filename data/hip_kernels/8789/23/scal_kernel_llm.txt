```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure ALPHA is loaded into a register to minimize repeated global memory accesses.
// Use shared memory if multiple warps in a block access the same data.
// Assess launch configuration to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency.
