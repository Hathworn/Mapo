// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Assess if loop unrolling can improve performance given the size of N.
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal memory transaction efficiency.
