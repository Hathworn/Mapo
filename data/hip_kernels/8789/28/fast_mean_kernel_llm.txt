// Consider using coalesced memory access for x to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that the access pattern maximizes memory coalescence for global memory reads.
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data to leverage cached loads, if applicable.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by optimizing the reduction code structure.
