```
// Remove redundant arithmetic operations for index calculations
// Consider using shared memory to support multiple threads accessing common data
// Use warp shuffle operations for efficient inter-thread communication
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform branching
