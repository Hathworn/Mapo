```
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve bandwidth utilization
// Use vectorized memory loads and stores if the hardware supports it
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of the warp size to avoid partial warp inefficiencies
// Consider using a loop unrolling technique to increase instruction-level parallelism
