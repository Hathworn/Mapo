```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing data in a contiguous manner
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently used data like mean and variance
// Minimize the use of expensive operations like sqrt by precomputing them if possible
// Explore the use of asynchronous memory transfers for overlapping computation and data transfer
// Check if using dynamic parallelism can enhance kernel launch efficiency
// Investigate the use of warp shuffle operations to reduce global memory access
