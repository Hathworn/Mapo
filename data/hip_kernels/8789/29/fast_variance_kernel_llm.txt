```
// Ensure coalesced access pattern for x and mean arrays
// Consider using shared memory for storing mean[filter] for improved access speed
// Investigate the possibility of minimizing register pressure by optimizing the pow calculation
// Consider unrolling loops to reduce loop overhead for better performance
// Validate if the division by (spatial * batch - 1) can be optimized or pre-computed
