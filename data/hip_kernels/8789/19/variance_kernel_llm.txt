```cpp
// Pre-compute scale factor outside of kernel loop for improved efficiency
// Calculate global thread index for parallel processing
// Use blockDim.y to distribute filters across multiple blocks if necessary
// Combine nested loops into a single loop for better memory access patterns
// Directly access flattened index for improved data locality
// Utilize powf to leverage hardware acceleration for float operations
```
