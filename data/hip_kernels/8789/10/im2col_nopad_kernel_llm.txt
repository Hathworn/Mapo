// Consider coalesced memory access for reading from 'im' array.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing 'data_col' for writing.
// Use shared memory to buffer frequently accessed data portions.
// Optimize thread block and grid size for better occupancy.
// Review and confirm stride alignment for memory access optimizations.
