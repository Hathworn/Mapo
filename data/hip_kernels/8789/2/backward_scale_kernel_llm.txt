// Unroll loops to reduce the loop control overhead and improve memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to store intermediate sums to reduce global memory access
// Reduce synchronization overhead by optimizing the reduction operation
// Use parallel reduction instead of sequential to exploit parallelism and speed up computation
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring global memory access patterns are aligned
