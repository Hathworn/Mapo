```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Reduce the number of divisions and modulo operations by using loop unrolling or pre-calculated offsets
// Ensure all threads within a warp access consecutive memory addresses (coalesced access) for optimal performance
// Check if the use of atomic operations can be minimized or replaced to avoid performance bottlenecks
// Evaluate whether loop transformations can help with memory access patterns and reduce latency
