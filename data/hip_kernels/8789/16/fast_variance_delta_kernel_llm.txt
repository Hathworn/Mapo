```
// Use shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory access
// Ensure efficient memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns
// Optimize the local memory usage to minimize bank conflicts and maximize throughput
// Consider unrolling loops if possible to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Reduce syncthreads usage by carefully managing thread dependencies
