```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring continuous threads access continuous memory locations
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads within a block access the same data frequently to reduce global memory traffic
// Experiment with different block sizes to determine optimal occupancy and performance balance
// Use efficient intrinsic operations like __fadd_rn, __fmul_rn where appropriate as already utilized
// Avoid thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
