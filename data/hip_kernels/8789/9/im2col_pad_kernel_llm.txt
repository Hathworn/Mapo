```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize thread divergence for better execution efficiency
// Use shared memory if frequent data reuse occurs to reduce global memory access
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize occupancy and performance
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned for potential caching benefits
