// Ensure coalesced memory access to data_col and data_im to improve memory bandwidth
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated access data and reduce global memory reads
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing redundant calculations within the loop
// Explore loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enhance computational efficiency
