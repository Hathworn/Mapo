```
// Consider using `atomicAdd` to avoid race conditions when updating `mean_delta`.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing unnecessary storage or increasing shared memory per block.
// Try to reduce memory divergence by ensuring access patterns are aligned for contiguous memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for the `for` loop iterating over `batch` to reduce loop overhead and enhance instruction level parallelism.
// Evaluate thread/block configurations to ensure optimal occupancy based on available registers and memory.
