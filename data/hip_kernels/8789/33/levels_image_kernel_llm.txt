// Consider using shared memory for image data within each block to reduce global memory accesses
// Explore using texture memory for constant image data when image size is large
// Minimize branching or conditional statements within the kernel for better runtime efficiency
// Unroll loops, if any, for better performance benefit
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Evaluate precision requirements and refactor to use half precision if suitable for further speedup
