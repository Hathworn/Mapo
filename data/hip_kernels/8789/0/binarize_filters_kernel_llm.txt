// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for loading data into shared memory to improve efficiency
// Optimize synchronization points to avoid unnecessary stalls
// Balance thread workloads to ensure efficient usage of computational resources
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to optimize the mean calculation
