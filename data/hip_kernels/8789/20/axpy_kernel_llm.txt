```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Align data to improve memory throughput
// Make use of shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Assess using texture memory for better cache behavior on read-only data
// Explore thread/block optimizations to balance workload effectively
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration
