```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize thread cooperation
// Reduce kernel launch overhead by combining tasks
