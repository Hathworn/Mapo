```
// Consider coalesced memory access to maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp efficiency.
// Explore increasing thread block size for better SM occupancy.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency, if applicable.
// Ensure aligned memory accesses to take advantage of memory coalescing.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to match the hardware configuration.
