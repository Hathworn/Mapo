```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning data access within shared memory
// Consider optimizing global memory access by reducing stride in the loop
// Potentially unroll loops to increase instruction throughput
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced for both col_sum and output arrays
