```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store row_sum[blockIdx.x] to minimize global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for writing to output to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that memory writes to output are properly aligned for improved performance.
// Consider occupancy optimizations by adjusting block and grid sizes for maximum parallelism.
