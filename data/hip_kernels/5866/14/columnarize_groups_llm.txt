```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning columnar_buffer and rowwise_buffer
// Examine possibility of shared memory use for frequently accessed data
// Check if reducing thread divergence by processing rows with similar column widths together is viable
// Explore loop unrolling for small col_count to reduce overhead
// Assess potential of prefetching into registers to minimize global memory latency
// Investigate alignment of memory accesses for col_base and read_ptr
// Examine data types to ensure memory transactions are efficiently sized
