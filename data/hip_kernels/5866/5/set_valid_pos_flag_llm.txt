```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider employing memory coalescing for count_buff accesses
// Ensure pos_buff accesses are coalesced for increased bandwidth
// Utilize occupancy calculator to determine optimal block size
// Minimize divergence by restructuring the if condition usage
```
