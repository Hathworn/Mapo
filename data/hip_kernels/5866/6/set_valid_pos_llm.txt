```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data into shared memory to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to the highest degree possible
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to further optimize data retrieval
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for better caching performance
