// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated accesses to col_widths and init_vals.
// Optimize coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Investigate the impact of different block sizes on kernel performance to improve occupancy.
// Utilize __restrict__ qualifiers if possible to hint the compiler about exclusive data access.
