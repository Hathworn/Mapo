```
// Combine bounds check conditions in one if-statement to reduce branching.
// Minimize accesses to global memory by utilizing shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to decrease loop overhead.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for global memory to maximize throughput.
// Evaluate potential benefit of using texture memory for read-only data access.
// Optimize atomic operations if they contribute significantly to memory contention.
