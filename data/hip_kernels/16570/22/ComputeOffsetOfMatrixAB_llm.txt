```
// Use shared memory to cache row sums for better memory access patterns
// Reduce global memory reads by loading row_sum into shared memory
// Ensure memory coalescing by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations in col_sum
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for col_sum if possible
// Balance the workload across threads to utilize available processing power
