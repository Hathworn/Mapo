```
// Optimize shared memory access by using warp-level parallelism for better memory coalescing.
// Pre-compute indices reused in loops to reduce redundant calculations in the kernel.
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed variables like stride parameters.
// Consider loop unrolling for the loop iterating over inputImages_channels to enhance performance.
// Use vectorized memory access patterns to improve throughput if possible.
// Ensure that the blocks are well-sized to keep high occupancy on the GPU.
