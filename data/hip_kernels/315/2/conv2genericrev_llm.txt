```
// Consider using constant memory for frequently accessed data like kernel_p for faster access
// Optimize shared memory usage to ensure all grid threads can utilize it effectively
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning input_p memory accesses among threads
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to enhance instruction parallelism
// Ensure shared memory buffer doesn't exceed the hardware's limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Reduce syncthreads usage when possible to decrease synchronization overhead
