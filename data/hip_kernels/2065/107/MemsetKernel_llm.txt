```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads properly
// Use __restrict__ pointers to hint at non-aliasing for compiler optimization
// Consider loop unrolling if loops are present in the kernel
// Avoid bank conflicts if shared memory usage is implemented
