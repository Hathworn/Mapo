// Ensure that input arrays are accessed in a coalesced manner
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed values
// Minimize branch divergence by simplifying conditional logic
// Optimize atomic operations to reduce contention
// Use vectorized operations to leverage SIMD capabilities
