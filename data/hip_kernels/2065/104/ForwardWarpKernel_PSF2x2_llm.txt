```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for the src, u, and v arrays to improve memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory if data reuse within a block is significant to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced writes to the dst and normalization_factor arrays for optimal write bandwidth.
// Utilize prefetching techniques to hide global memory latency.
// Minimize potential bank conflicts if using shared memory within the kernel.
