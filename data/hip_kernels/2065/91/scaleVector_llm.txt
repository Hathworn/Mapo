// Use shared memory to cache data for better memory access patterns.
// Minimize global memory access by using registers for frequently accessed variables.
// Optimize block and grid size configuration for improved occupancy and parallelism.
// Consider using constant memory if scale is uniform across threads to leverage faster access.
