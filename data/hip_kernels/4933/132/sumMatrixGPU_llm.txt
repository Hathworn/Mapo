```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced accesses to global memory for MatA and MatB
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory sMatC
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads() after loading data into shared memory
// Optimize block size for better occupancy and memory throughput
