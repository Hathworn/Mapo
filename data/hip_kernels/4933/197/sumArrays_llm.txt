```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache A and B subarrays for increased bandwidth
// Further unroll the loop to exploit more parallelism and reduce loop overhead
// Ensure that loop unrolling does not exceed register limits of the GPU
// Align data to cache line boundaries for improved memory access efficiency
