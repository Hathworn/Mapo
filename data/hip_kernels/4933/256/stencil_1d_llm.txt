```cpp
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for improved performance
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses
// Utilize __syncthreads to synchronize shared memory access
// Consider increasing thread block size for better occupancy
// Exploit data locality by reusing data from shared memory
// Apply loop unrolling for better instruction throughput
```
