```
// Consider coalesced memory access for g_idata to optimize global memory access.
// Evaluate the benefit of accessing g_idata as float2 or int2 to achieve coalesced access.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for idata and improve performance.
// Investigate warp shuffle operations to replace __syncthreads() within a warp.
// Utilize loop unrolling for the in-place reduction loop to minimize the loop overhead.
// Explore using thread-fence operations for atomic operations if needed.
// Minimize divergence in the if conditions to exploit warp parallelism effectively.
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to inform the compiler about non-aliasing pointers.
