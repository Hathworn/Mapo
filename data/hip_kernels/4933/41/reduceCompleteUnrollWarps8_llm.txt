// Consider aligning memory access to improve coalescing and reduce latency
// Use shared memory wisely to further decrease global memory traffic
// Investigate the potential for loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure data dependencies are minimized to improve parallel execution
// Evaluate the impact of block size on performance and adjust as needed
