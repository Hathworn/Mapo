```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when reading from global memory
// Ensure halo regions are loaded efficiently into shared memory
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Implement boundary checks to prevent out-of-bound memory access
// Utilize loop unrolling to enhance computational throughput
// Ensure synchronization for correct stencil computation
