```
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate data to reduce global memory accesses
// Preload data into registers for repeated access within the loop
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize synchronization and data sharing
// Minimize divergent branches inside the kernel loop
