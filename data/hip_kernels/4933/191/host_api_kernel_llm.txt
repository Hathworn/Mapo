```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Implement coalesced memory accesses to improve memory read efficiency
// Minimize branch divergence by simplifying conditionals within the loop
// Reduce arithmetic operations inside the loop to optimize performance
// Align data structures to ensure natural size for potential memory access benefits
