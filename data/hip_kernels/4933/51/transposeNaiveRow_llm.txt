```
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access
// Ensure shared memory array is padded to avoid bank conflicts
// Align data access patterns with transpose to improve cache utilization
// Minimize divergent warps for better performance
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure synchronization between threads within block
```
