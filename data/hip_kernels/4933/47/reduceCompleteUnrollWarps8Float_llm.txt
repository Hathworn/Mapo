```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to g_idata and g_odata for improved performance.
// Ensure all thread blocks have enough work to avoid idle warps in the unrolling process.
// Evaluate the block size to optimize occupancy and resource usage in the GPU.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses by considering the shared memory stride.
// Consider using __restrict__ to provide the compiler with more optimization opportunities.
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to prevent unnecessary synchronization delays.
