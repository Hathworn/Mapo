```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data access patterns efficiently
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block and avoid data hazards
// Unroll loops to optimize warp execution and reduce instruction overhead
// Use volatile keyword for variables involved in the warp unrolling to prevent compiler optimizations that could lead to incorrect results
// Check boundary conditions to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() inside loops to reduce synchronization overhead
