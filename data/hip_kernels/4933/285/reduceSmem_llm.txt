// Consider using half precision for smem to save memory bandwidth if precision allows.
// Ensure memory alignment for accessing idata and smem to optimize coalesced memory access.
// Use bank conflict avoidance techniques when accessing shared memory.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling further for the reduction phase could improve performance.
