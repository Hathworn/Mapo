```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses in the loop for improved memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for intermediate results
// Consider aligning data structures to achieve faster memory access
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed data to potentially reduce memory latency
// Explore loop unrolling further for potential performance gains
