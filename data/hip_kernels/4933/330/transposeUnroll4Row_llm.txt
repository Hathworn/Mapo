```
// Ensure global memory access is coalesced by aligning loads with warp size
// Consider using shared memory to minimize redundant global memory loads
// Use loop unrolling to enhance memory throughput by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Check boundaries effectively to reduce divergent branches
// Align data structures in memory for more efficient access patterns
