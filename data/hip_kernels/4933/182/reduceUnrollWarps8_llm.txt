```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access times.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive global memory addresses.
// Try to minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to help the compiler with optimization.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling offers performance benefits in your context.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations (__shfl_down_sync) to optimize warp reduction.
// Ensure proper alignment for global memory accesses.
// Avoid unnecessary memory operations by storing results only when needed.
