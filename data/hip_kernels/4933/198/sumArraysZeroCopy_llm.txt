```cpp
// Use memory coalescing for improved memory access efficiency
// Ensure alignment of A, B, C arrays to optimize memory transactions
// Experiment with different block size to achieve optimal occupancy and performance
// Leverage shared memory if possible to further improve memory access patterns
```
