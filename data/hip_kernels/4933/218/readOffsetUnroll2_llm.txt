// Use shared memory to minimize global memory latency.  
// Align memory accesses to reduce memory coalescing issues.  
// Ensure loop unrolling is used effectively to increase throughput.  
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage.  
// Optimize offset calculation to avoid redundant computations.  
// Consider increasing thread block size to improve occupancy.
