// Consider coalesced memory accesses by aligning data on 128-byte boundaries.
// Ensure that each thread accesses memory contiguously to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Utilize shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses if needed.
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy and bandwidth usage.
