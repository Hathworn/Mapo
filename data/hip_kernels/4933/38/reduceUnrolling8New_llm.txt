```cpp
// Leverage memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses during reduction
// Consider using half-warp striding to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure synchronization after memory updates to avoid race conditions
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by proper data placement
// Reduce the amount of global memory updates by using atomic operations if applicable
// Use loop unrolling pragmas to improve loop performance through compiler optimization
