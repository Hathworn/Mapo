```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using loop unrolling for larger matrices to improve performance
// Ensure optimal block and grid size for better occupancy and performance
// Minimize register usage by optimizing thread-level computations
