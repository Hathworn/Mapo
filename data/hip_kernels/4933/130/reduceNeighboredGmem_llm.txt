// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for efficiency.
// Make use of __syncthreads() to ensure memory consistency within the block.
// Boundary check to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
// Consider using multiple warps to fully utilize the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.
