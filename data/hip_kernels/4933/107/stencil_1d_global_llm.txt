// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider increasing BDIM to maximize data throughput while staying within shared memory limits.
// Explore using a larger RADIUS for potential speed-ups if memory bandwidth allows.
// Evaluate caching strategies to further optimize data locality and reduce memory latency.
