```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant memory access within the block
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures with warp size
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to improve cache hit rates
// Investigate potential performance gains from loop unrolling in relevant sections
// Assess the impact of memory bank conflicts and minimize if possible
