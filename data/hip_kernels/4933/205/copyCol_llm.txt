```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing consecutive memory locations within warp
// Consider shared memory usage for reused data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and reduce latency
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Use loop unrolling if the compiler doesn't optimize it automatically
```
