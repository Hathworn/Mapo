```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Use warp shuffling to reduce synchronization overhead during reduction
// Minimize synchronization calls by combining strides in reduction loops
// Consider adjusting block size to fit shared memory size constraints
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve cache utilization
```
