```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Avoid unnecessary recomputations by precomputing common expressions
// Ensure proper alignment of memory accesses for efficient fetching
// Use more register variables to hold intermediate results and reduce memory latency
// Minimize synchronization by balancing the use of shared and global memory
// Consider loop unrolling strategically to minimize loop overhead and better utilize GPU resources
