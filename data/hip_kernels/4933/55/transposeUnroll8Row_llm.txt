```cpp
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access by reducing global memory transactions
// Align shared memory access to prevent bank conflicts
// Unroll loops for better ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory writes
