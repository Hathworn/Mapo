```
// Consider increasing the size of data processed per thread to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses and thus improve performance
// Use volatile keyword for accessing shared memory during warp unrolling to hint compiler for faster access
