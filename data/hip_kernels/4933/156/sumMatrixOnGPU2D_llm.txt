```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for coalesced access
// Ensure data is accessed sequentially to maximize memory throughput
// Align data structures to avoid misaligned access penalties
// Utilize vectorized loads and stores if possible
// Minimize divergent branches within the GPU kernel
