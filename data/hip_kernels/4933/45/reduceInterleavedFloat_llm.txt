```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within each block
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data accesses within warps
// Consider loop unrolling for the reduction loop to reduce branching and improve performance
// Use early exit strategy if unnecessary computations are detected based on data size
```
