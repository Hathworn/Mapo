```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved throughput
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Use asynchronous memory copies where applicable for overlapping computations and data transfers
