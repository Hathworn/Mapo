```
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved performance
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure the kernel launch configuration matches hardware capabilities
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
// Profile the kernel to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly
