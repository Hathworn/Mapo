```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for repeated elements
// Try to increase thread block size for better occupancy
// Ensure coalesced accesses in global memory reads/writes
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated patterns
// Reduce synchronization points where possible
// Evaluate bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Adjust NPAD value if possible to better match your device's memory architecture
