// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for loading data into shared memory.
// Use atomic operations or warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate the use of warp unrolling to optimize reduction computation within shared memory.
// Review grid-size and block-size configurations to ensure optimal occupancy and performance.
// Prioritize shared memory usage to minimize accesses to global memory.
