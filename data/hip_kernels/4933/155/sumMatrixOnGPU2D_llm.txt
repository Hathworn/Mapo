// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing thread blocks to match matrix dimensions.
// Minimize warp divergence by avoiding conditional statements if possible.
// Optimize data layout for better cache utilization and alignment.
