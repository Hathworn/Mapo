```
// Unroll the loop to reduce global memory access latency.
// Perform a single bounds check instead of multiple to reduce instruction overhead.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for faster access.
// Employ warp-level unrolling for further reduction in synchronization overhead.
// Utilize volatile in warp to ensure memory coherence.
