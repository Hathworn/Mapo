// Use shared memory for coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Load data from global to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory.
// Write data from shared to global memory to take advantage of shared memory speed.
