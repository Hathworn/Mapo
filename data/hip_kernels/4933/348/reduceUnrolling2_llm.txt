// Consider using shared memory to store input data to reduce global memory access.
// Add __syncthreads() after updating g_idata to ensure all threads see the change.
// Ensure boundary check before accessing g_idata to avoid accessing out of bounds.
// Utilize warp shuffle or warp reduction for further reduction within warp level.
// Consider using atomic operations for final result aggregation across blocks.
