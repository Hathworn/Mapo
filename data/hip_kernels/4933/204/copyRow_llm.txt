// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance
// Ensure occupancy by using an optimal number of threads per block
// Replace threadIdx and blockIdx with 2D indices for better readability
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring uniform execution paths
