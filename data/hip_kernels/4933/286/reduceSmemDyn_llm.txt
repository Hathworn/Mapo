```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure out-of-bounds threads don't access g_idata to prevent unnecessary computations
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and enhance performance
// Leverage warp shuffling to avoid using __syncthreads() within a warp for better efficiency
// Utilize volatile keyword to prevent compiler reordering of memory operations within a warp
