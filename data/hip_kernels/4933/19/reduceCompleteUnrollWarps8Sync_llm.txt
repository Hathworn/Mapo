// Consider coalescing memory access for g_idata to improve memory access efficiency.
// Optimize memory transactions by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access during the accumulation phase.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to optimize intra-warp communication and reductions.
