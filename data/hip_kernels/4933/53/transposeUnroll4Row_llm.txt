```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Utilize shared memory for reduced global memory traffic if possible
// Consider using warp synchronous programming for further optimization
// Experiment with different block sizes to find optimal configuration
// Maximize occupancy by adjusting grid and block dimensions
```
