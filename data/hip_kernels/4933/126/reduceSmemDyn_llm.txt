```
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns
// Initialize out-of-bound threads to 0 to avoid invalid memory access
// Perform in-place reduction in shared memory with loop unrolling to optimize computation
// Unroll the final warp operations to reduce iteration overhead and eliminate unnecessary __syncthreads
// Store the block's reduced result in global memory only from thread 0 to minimize global memory writes
