```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning global memory access.
// Increase block size for more threads to improve occupancy.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access overhead.
// Preload data into shared memory to minimize latency.
// Ensure correct handling of halo regions to avoid race conditions.
// Use loop unrolling to improve the pipeline efficiency.
