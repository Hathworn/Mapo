```
// Use shared memory to store tiles of MatA and MatB for coalesced access
// Consider loop unrolling if the operation inside the loop is computationally intensive
// Optimize memory access by ensuring all threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing data reuse within shared memory tiles
// Align memory accesses with memory boundaries for improved performance
