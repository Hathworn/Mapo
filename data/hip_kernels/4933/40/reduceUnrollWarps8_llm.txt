```
// Consider coalescing memory access by aligning data structure
// Use shared memory to reduce frequent access to global memory 
// Unroll loops to decrease loop overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Optimize memory access patterns for efficient global memory usage
// Consider warp-level primitives to reduce thread divergence and synchronization
