```
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers for potential memory access optimization
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Use shared memory if frequent data reuse is identified for better performance
// Minimize printf usage or replace with a more efficient logging technique
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory access
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
