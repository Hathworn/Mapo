```c
// Ensure data is accessed in a coalesced manner to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure synchronization to avoid race conditions after each step of reduction
// Adapt shared memory allocation to match block size for better occupancy
// Consider loop unrolling to further optimize reduction operations
```
