// Consolidate I/O operations by using one thread per block to minimize redundant printing.
// Ensure kernel launch configuration uses minimal resources by setting threads per block.
// Consider using shared memory to optimize data access patterns if applicable.
// Reduce block count if possible to minimize overdraw and competition for GPU resources.
