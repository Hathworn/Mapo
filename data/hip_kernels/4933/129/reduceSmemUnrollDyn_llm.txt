```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for g_idata to utilize memory bandwidth effectively.
// Unroll loop further for idx computation to reduce loop overhead.
// Use __ldg() for read-only access to global memory to leverage L1 cache.
// Consider increasing shared memory usage to avoid global memory dependency within the block.
// Align block dimension and size with hardware warp size for maximum efficiency.
// Reduce __syncthreads() where possible to minimize thread synchronization overhead.
// Use vectorized loads (e.g., int4) to further optimize memory transactions.
// Evaluate using shuffle instructions (e.g., __shfl_down_sync) instead of shared memory for reductions.
