//Consider coalesced memory access for MatA, MatB, and MatC to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
//Use shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
//Assess occupancy and adjust block size to optimize the use of available resources.
//Consider loop unrolling for operations inside the if statement to enhance performance.
