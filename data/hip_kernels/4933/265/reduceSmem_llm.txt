```
// Ensure boundary check is in place during shared memory load
// Reduce synchronization by using loop optimization for reduction
// Use volatile keyword to prevent unwanted compiler optimizations on shared memory
// Use warp-level operations for reduction when thread count is lower than 32
// Ensure appropriate result storage to global memory after reduction
