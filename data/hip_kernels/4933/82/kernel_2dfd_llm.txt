```
// Consider using warp-wise memory access patterns to improve coalescence.
// Investigate if register usage can be optimized further for better latency hiding.
// Evaluate the benefit of using multiple streams for overlapping computation and data transfer.
// Analyze the memory access patterns to determine if additional shared memory usage can be beneficial.
// Ensure all accesses to global memory are coalesced to prevent unnecessary memory transactions.
