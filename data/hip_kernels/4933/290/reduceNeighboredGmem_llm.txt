```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for better performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to global memory when reading and writing g_idata and g_odata.
// Use more aggressive loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead.
// Reduce synchronization points to minimize thread block synchronization latency.
