```
// Unroll loop to increase instruction-level parallelism and reduce branch divergence
// Use shared memory or registers to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all previous operations are completed before proceeding
// Use volatile for warp-level reduction to ensure memory consistency
// Unroll warp-level reduction to minimize branch divergence and improve performance
// Store block results in global memory only once to minimize write operations
