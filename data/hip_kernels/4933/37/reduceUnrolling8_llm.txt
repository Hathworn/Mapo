```c
// Use register accumulation to reduce global memory access times.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced and efficiently use the memory bandwidth.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce the frequency of accessing global memory.
// Optimize the loop to minimize the use of shared memory synchronization where possible.
// Avoid divergent branches to ensure warp efficiency.
