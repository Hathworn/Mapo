```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Apply loop unrolling to increase throughput and reduce loop overhead
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper data access patterns
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() within block
// Avoid diverging branches to maintain warp efficiency
// Align data structures to ensure proper memory alignment and access speed
// Use atomic operations if needed for reduction in global memory
```
