```
// Consider coalesced memory access when loading g_idata into shared memory
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring data alignment
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce synchronization overhead
// Balance workload among threads to ensure efficient use of parallel resources
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to improve performance
// Optimize shared memory usage to minimize memory access latency
