```
// Unroll loop operations to reduce number of iterations and improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory for reduction to minimize global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing adjacent elements in global memory.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure data consistency among threads in the block.
