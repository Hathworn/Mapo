```
// Consider using shared memory for block-level data reuse to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Explore half-warp unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure alignment of data to avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory.
