```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory if reusing data loaded from global memory multiple times within the block.
// Ensure data alignment to enhance memory access efficiency.
// Avoid bank conflicts if shared memory is utilized.
// Optimize the grid and block size for better occupancy and memory efficiency.
