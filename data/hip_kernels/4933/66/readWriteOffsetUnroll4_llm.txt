```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Preload data into shared memory to minimize memory access time
// Ensure bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have finished loading data
// Avoid divergent branches by aligning access with blockDim.x
```
