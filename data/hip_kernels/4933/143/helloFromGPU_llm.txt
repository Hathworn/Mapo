```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access overhead
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced access
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately to synchronize threads after shared memory operations
// Avoid frequent usage of printf in device code to reduce performance impact
