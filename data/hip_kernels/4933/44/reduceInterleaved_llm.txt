```
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve bandwidth.
// Minimize thread divergence for efficient execution.
// Ensure data is aligned in memory for optimal access patterns.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further optimize reduction.
