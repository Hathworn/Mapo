// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve performance.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Unroll loops further for additional performance gains.
// Ensure minimal synchronization to avoid performance bottlenecks.
// Optimize memory access patterns for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Align data in shared memory for efficient memory access.
