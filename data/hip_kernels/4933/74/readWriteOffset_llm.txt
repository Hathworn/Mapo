```
// Consider using shared memory for coalesced access to A and B
// Ensure that the offset is aligned with memory access patterns
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Use vectorized data types if possible for better memory throughput
// Load data into registers before using in calculations to reduce latency
