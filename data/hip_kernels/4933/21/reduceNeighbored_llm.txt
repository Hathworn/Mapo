```
// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory appropriately.
// Reduce global memory access by employing shared memory for intra-block reduction.
// Consider minimizing the use of __syncthreads for better warp efficiency.
// Ensure proper alignment and coalesced memory access to improve performance.
