```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for g_idata and g_odata
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Minimize memory transaction size by using shared memory when possible
// Ensure stride accesses are aligned to improve memory access efficiency
// Reduce synchronization overhead by placing __syncthreads() conditionally
