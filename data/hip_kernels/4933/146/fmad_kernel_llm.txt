```
// Use shared memory if multiple writes are combined
// Ensure coalesced access patterns by adjusting data layout in memory
// Minimize global memory accesses by prefetching data into registers
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions to reduce memory traffic
// Align data structures to improve memory transaction efficiency
