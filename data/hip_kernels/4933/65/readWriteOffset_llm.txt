```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations in A, B, and C.
// Optimize memory access patterns to utilize L2 cache effectively, especially for large arrays with offset handling.
// Evaluate the necessity of offset for performance impact and reduce its influence if possible to maintain memory coalescing.
