```
// Consider increasing unroll factor for better memory coalescing.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer inputs to assist compiler optimization.
// Align idx calculation with warp size to improve memory access patterns.
// Experiment with different shared memory bank configurations to avoid conflicts.
// Balance shared memory usage to prevent resource contention among blocks.
// Ensure proper alignment of shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate register usage per thread to ensure optimal occupancy.
