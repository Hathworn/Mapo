```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data structures.
// Use shared memory to improve memory access patterns within blocks.
// Evaluate loop unrolling for better instruction pipelining.
// Ensure that tiling strategies exploit memory hierarchy effectively.
// Choose block and grid dimensions to enhance warp and occupancy efficiency.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Implement memory access pattern analysis for further optimization.
