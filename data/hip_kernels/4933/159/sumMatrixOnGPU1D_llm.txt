```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data to minimize the number of global memory accesses
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Optimize for memory access patterns that align with L2 cache lines
// Implement warp-based synchronization to avoid excessive divergence
// Utilize vectorized operations to further enhance memory bandwidth
