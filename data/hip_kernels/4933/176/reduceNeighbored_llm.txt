```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to global memory by aligning data
// Minimize bank conflicts during in-place reduction
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize divergence
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance performance
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to improve efficiency
```
