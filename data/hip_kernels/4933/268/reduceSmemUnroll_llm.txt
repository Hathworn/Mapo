```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning global memory accesses
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate summation to avoid redundant global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory writing
// Employ unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase throughput
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp take the same execution path
// Enable occupancy by configuring block size to efficiently use resources
