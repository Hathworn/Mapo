// Ensure that shared memory access is coalesced and minimize bank conflicts
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access and enhance performance
// Avoid redundant global memory accesses by performing calculations in shared memory
// Check for warp divergence during reduction to improve execution efficiency
// Ensure global memory writes are coalesced for maximum throughput
// Consider using loop unrolling techniques to enhance reduction process
// Optimize synchronization points to minimize overhead and improve performance
