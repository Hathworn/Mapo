```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance
// Consider using shared memory to reduce latency during intra-block reduction
// Use loop unrolling to minimize overhead associated with branch instructions
// Align memory access patterns with warp size for efficiency
// Ensure __syncthreads() is correctly placed to prevent race conditions
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
