// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve access efficiency.
// Ensure that the shared memory usage is optimized to avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling can be applied in the reduction step for performance gains.
// Assess if occupancy could be improved by adjusting block and grid sizes.
