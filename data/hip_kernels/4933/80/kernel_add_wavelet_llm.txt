```cpp
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Try loop unrolling if applicable to enhance performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data
// Consider occupancy optimization for better utilization of hardware resources
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ to provide the compiler with optimization hints
// Investigate cacheability options to improve memory access times
