```
// Consider using shared memory to alleviate global memory bandwidth pressure
// Use loop unrolling to reduce synchronization overhead and improve performance
// Employ block-level reduction with shared memory for faster access compared to global memory
// Minimize global memory access by updating variables within registers wherever possible
// Focus on optimizing memory coalescing for better memory transaction efficiency
