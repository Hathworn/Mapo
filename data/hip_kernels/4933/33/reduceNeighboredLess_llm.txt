```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store block data to reduce global memory access.
// Enable compiler optimizations or inline PTX to improve performance.
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize shared memory usage and performance.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage by restructuring reduction operations if possible.
