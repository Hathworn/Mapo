```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve performance.
// Ensure that data loaded into shared memory does not exceed shared memory limits.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for A and B to enhance efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after data is loaded into shared memory.
// Evaluate data alignment to avoid memory bank conflicts in shared memory.
