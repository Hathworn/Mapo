// Use shared memory for faster intra-block communication and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider unrolling the reduction loop to improve performance
// Reduce synchronization overhead by minimizing __syncthreads() usage
// Align memory access patterns to coalesce global memory reads and writes
// Avoid warp divergence to enhance parallel efficiency
