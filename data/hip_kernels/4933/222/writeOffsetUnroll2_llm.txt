```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory if accessing A and B repeatedly to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure grid and block sizes maximize occupancy
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if applicable to allow compiler optimizations
// Align data structures to 128-byte boundaries when possible for better performance
