// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to A and B within a block  
// Optimize memory access coalescing for A and B arrays  
// Use stride-based loop if the number of threads does not divide N evenly  
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for improved performance  
// Explore using warp-level primitives for reductions if applicable
