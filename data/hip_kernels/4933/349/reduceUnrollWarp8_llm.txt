```c
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for optimal performance.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Explore using __shfl_xor_sync for warp-level primitives to replace volatile memory operations.
// Profile and adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency.
