```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align data accesses to improve memory coalescing.
// Consider warp-level synchronization for efficient memory operations.
// Check if the loop can be further unrolled to reduce loop overhead.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy.
