```cpp
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to enhance coalescing
// Utilize shared memory if there are opportunities for data reuse
// Ensure efficient use of registers by reducing variable usage where possible
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives for potential parallelization gains
// Balance workload between threads to avoid divergence
