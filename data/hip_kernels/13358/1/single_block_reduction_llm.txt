```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads/writes
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if there are no aliasing issues
// Unroll loops where possible to reduce loop overhead
// Use padding in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Prefer __shfl_sync or warp-level primitives for reductions within a warp
// Reduce the overhead of __syncthreads() by minimizing its usage
// Merge multiple kernel launches into a single launch if applicable
