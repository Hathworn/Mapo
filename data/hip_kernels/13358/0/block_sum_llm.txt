```
// Consider using memory coalescing patterns for better memory access efficiency
// Ensure the shared memory size does not exceed hardware limitations
// Use conditional operator to optimize bounds check and minimize branch divergence
// Optimize syncthreads calls to reduce overhead
// Evaluate using warp-level reduction where applicable to improve performance
