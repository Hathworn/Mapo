```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to improve performance.
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced for device memory access.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Consider loop unrolling for performance-critical loops.
// Balance the workload among threads to maximize warp efficiency.
// Use scalar replacement to avoid redundant memory loads.
// Minimize register pressure by using local variables judiciously.
// Experiment with different thread block sizes for optimal occupancy.
