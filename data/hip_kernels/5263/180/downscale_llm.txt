```c
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory access.
// Perform memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Consider using the hipMemcpyAsync function for asynchronous data transfer if applicable.
// Optimize memory access patterns to leverage the L2 cache effectively.
