```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth
// Use vectorized data types to optimize memory throughput
// Minimize divergence in warp execution for better performance
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency
// Utilize constant memory for read-only data access pattern
// Align data structures to improve access efficiency
// Verify occupancy to ensure enough threads per block are used
