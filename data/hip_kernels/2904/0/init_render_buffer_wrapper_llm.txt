```
// Consider using memory coalescing techniques for improved access patterns
// Optimize for L1 and L2 cache usage by aligning data with cache blocks
// Reduce global memory accesses by minimizing the number of accesses within the loop
// Consider using shared memory if possible to store intermediate computations
