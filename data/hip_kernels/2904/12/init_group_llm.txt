```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loading col_widths into shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory access.
// Use const memory for init_vals if they don't change and need to be accessed by all threads.
// Ensure aligned memory access to prevent bank conflicts and improve performance.
// Minimize the size of the kernel if possible to improve occupancy and reduce register usage.
