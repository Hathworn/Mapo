```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache input data if reused across iterations
// Coalesce memory accesses to outgrad and indata arrays for better performance
// Consider increasing occupancy by adjusting block size or using launch bounds
// Avoid warp divergence by processing boundary conditions uniformly
```
