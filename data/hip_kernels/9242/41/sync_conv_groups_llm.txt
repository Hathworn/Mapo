```
// Consider using __shared__ memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Prefer using float4 instead of float for vectorized operations when applicable.
// Utilize __restrict__ keyword to improve compiler optimization opportunities.
// Align data structures to ensure memory alignment and improve access speed.
