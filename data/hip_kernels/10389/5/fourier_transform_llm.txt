```
// Consider increasing block size to better utilize GPU resources
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently utilized and not exceeded
// Potential reduction of thread divergence by aligning data sizes
// Evaluate coalescing of global memory accesses to decrease latency
// Fine-tune synchronization points to avoid unnecessary stalls
// Profile memory bandwidth utilization to identify further optimizations
