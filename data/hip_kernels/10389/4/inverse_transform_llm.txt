```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache input data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced access patterns when reading from and writing to global memory
// Ensure proper memory alignment to maximize performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword to inform compiler about non-aliasing pointers
// Optimize the calculation of angle to avoid repeated calculations
