```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Precompute constant values outside the loop to minimize computation
// Use loop unrolling for the inner 'for' loop to improve performance
// Align memory accesses to coalesce loads and stores
// Consider adjusting block size to maximize occupancy and throughput
