// Consider using shared memory for A and B to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and memory throughput.
// Ensure data arrays A, B, and C are aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for increasing instruction throughput.
