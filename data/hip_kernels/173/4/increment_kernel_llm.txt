```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved memory throughput.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for your device.
// Ensure data is aligned to enable efficient vectorized memory transactions.
