```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for improved memory bandwidth
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous data is accessed by threads
// Minimize the use of global memory by reusing register values whenever possible
// Ensure access patterns cause minimal bank conflicts within shared memory
