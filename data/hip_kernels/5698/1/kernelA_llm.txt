```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently used data for each block.
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global reads and writes.
// Ensure loop unrolling for performance improvements where possible.
// Use aligned memory access to reduce the number of memory transactions.
// Minimize thread divergence within the warp.
