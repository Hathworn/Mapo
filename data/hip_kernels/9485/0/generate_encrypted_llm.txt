```
// Consider coalesced memory access for pDataPointer and pRandomData to improve bandwidth.
// Ensure that pSize is a multiple of the block size for optimal resource utilization.
// Utilize shared memory if repetitive access to pRandomData can benefit from reduced global memory access.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring well-aligned block sizes.
// Experiment with different block sizes to achieve maximum occupancy.
