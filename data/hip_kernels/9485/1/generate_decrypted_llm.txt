// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for pDataPointer and pRandomData to improve performance
// Ensure pSize is aligned to optimal memory transactions for efficient access
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same memory location frequently
// Optimize thread block size for maximum occupancy and memory throughput
