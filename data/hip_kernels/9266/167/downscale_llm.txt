// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to improve memory bandwidth
// Use memory coalescing techniques to ensure threads access contiguous memory locations
// Optimize block and grid configuration to maximize occupancy and minimize thread divergence
