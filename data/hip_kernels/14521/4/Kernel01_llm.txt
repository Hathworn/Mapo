```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load tiles into shared memory for coalesced global memory access
// Synchronize threads after loading to ensure all threads are ready for computation
// Perform computation using data in shared memory to maximize reuse
// Synchronize threads after computation to avoid race conditions in next iteration
```
