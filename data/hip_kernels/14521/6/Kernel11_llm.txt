```
// Consider reducing global memory accesses by utilizing shared memory more efficiently
// Check coalesced memory access for arrays A and B to improve performance
// Ensure that the TILE_SIZE is set appropriately to maximize occupancy and performance
// Investigate if loop unrolling in the accumulation step could provide a performance boost
// Confirm grid dimensions are optimized for the given input size for maximal throughput
