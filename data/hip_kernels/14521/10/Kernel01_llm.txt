// Use pointer arithmetic to improve memory access patterns
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for matrices A and B
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads and writes
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use vectorized operations where possible for improved throughput
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy
