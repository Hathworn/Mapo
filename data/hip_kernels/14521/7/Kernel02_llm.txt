```
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure shared memory allocation correctness
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
