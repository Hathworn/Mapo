// Consider using shared memory to cache data from matrices A and B for faster access
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring data coalescing in the global memory reads and writes
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by adjusting memory access patterns if needed
// Try to reduce the number of conditional checks within the kernels' execution paths
// Investigate the use of vectorized operations for improving data throughput and parallelism efficiency
