```cpp
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for better performance.
// Consider using float4 or float2 for loading global memory if possible.
// Ensure that shared memory access is free of bank conflicts.
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Consider adjusting the SIZE for optimal occupancy and memory usage.
// Explore tuning block size and grid size based on the target GPU architecture.
