```
// Consider using float4 instead of float for improved memory coalescing.
// Ensure a is aligned for better coalesced access patterns.
// Ensure b is aligned for better coalesced access patterns.
// Use __restrict__ to allow more aggressive compiler optimizations.
// Optimize shared memory usage by avoiding bank conflicts.
// Implement loop unrolling within the while loop for reduced loop overhead.
// Adjust grid size to be a multiple of DP_BLOCKSIZE for better occupancy.
