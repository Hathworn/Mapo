```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve memory access optimization
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses by checking alignment of Y, dY, and dX
// Use shared memory efficiently by limiting the size of reduction_buffer
// Consider avoiding unnecessary synchronizations if possible
// Balance computations between threads to maximize occupancy
