```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for Y, dY, and dX.
// Ensure __shared__ memory usage is optimal to reduce bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance in sum calculation.
// Implement warp-level reduction to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Align warp-level operations to avoid warp divergence.
