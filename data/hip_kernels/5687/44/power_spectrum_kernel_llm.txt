```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for values accessed multiple times within a block.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory for improved performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for reading and writing global memory.
// Align data structures for better memory access patterns.
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data that can benefit from cache.
// Improve data locality by restructuring computation to reduce cache misses.
// Utilize atomic operations only when necessary to avoid serialization overhead.
