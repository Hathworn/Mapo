```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to store Ar and Aw portions.
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning shared memory usage.
// Prefetch global memory data to registers to reduce latency.
// Use more uniform and coalesced memory access patterns.
// Ensure data is being accessed with aligned memory operations.
// Employ loop unrolling to optimize the iteration over global thread ID.
// Consider using __syncthreads for synchronizing threads effectively.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations if needed.
// Ensure thread-block dimensions are optimized for the GPU architecture.
// Tune grid and block dimensions based on kernel performance analysis.
