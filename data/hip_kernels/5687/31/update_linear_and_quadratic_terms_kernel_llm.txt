```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring linear and quadratic arrays are accessed in a contiguous manner
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
// Use shared memory if possible to store values that are repeatedly accessed within threads
// Repeat the optimization for quadratic term updates with warp-level reduction to minimize global memory accesses
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to achieve full utilization of the GPU cores
// Double-check memory bounds and alignment to prevent memory access bottlenecks
