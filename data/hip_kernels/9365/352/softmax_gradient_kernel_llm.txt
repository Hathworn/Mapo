```cpp
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing.
// Use shared memory effectively by reducing bank conflicts.
// Consider using half precision arithmetic if accuracy permits.
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce global memory transactions.
// Balance the number of threads per block with the memory bandwidth.
