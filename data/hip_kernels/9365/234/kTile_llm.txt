```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data from global to shared memory
// Ensure shared memory size matches the tile size to optimize for bank conflicts
// Consider changing tile dimensions or using loop unrolling for better performance
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls by ensuring threads work independently where possible
```
