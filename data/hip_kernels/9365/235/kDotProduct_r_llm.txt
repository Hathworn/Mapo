```
// Use local variables wherever possible to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize shared memory access by grouping calculations
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for arrays a and b
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by proper index calculation
// Optimize reduction with arithmetic optimizations to reduce instruction count
