```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data like labels and maxProbs to reduce global memory access
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores for probs array to enhance memory bandwidth usage
// Use loop unrolling techniques for the loop iterating over numOut to minimize loop overhead
