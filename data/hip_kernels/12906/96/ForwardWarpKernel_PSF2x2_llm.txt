// Use shared memory for commonly accessed variables to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using a texture cache for src array to optimize memory read operations
// Use loop unrolling techniques to improve performance of tightly-bound loops
// Minimize atomic operations by optimizing data structures and parallel reduction methods
