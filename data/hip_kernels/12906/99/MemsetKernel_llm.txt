// Consider using shared memory to store data that multiple threads within the same block may reuse.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that global memory accesses are contiguous.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy.
// Minimize register usage to allow more threads per block.
