```
// Consider using shared memory to cache normalization_factor to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize thread block dimensions to enhance coalesced memory access patterns.
// Ensure that block size is a multiple of warp size to fully utilize the hardware.
// Ensure that aligned memory access patterns are used for both image and normalization_factor.
// Prefetch data to registers where possible for reduced latency.
