```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for array 'u', 'v', 'src' to maximize memory throughput
// Minimize branching by streamlining conditions for early return and boundary checks
// Explore latency hiding strategies by utilizing additional computation or instruction overlap
// Assess warp occupancy and adjust block size for maximized parallel efficiency
