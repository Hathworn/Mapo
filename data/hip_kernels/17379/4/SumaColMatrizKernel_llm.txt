```
// Consider using a memory coalescing approach to optimize global memory access
// Utilize a block size that prevents bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Explore increasing the block size or grid size for better occupancy
// Evaluate loop unrolling based on the number of iterations and register usage
// Implement warp shuffle operations for a more efficient reduction
// Assess if more shared memory usage could further optimize reduction
