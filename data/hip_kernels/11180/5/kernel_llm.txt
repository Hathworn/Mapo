```
// Use coalesced accesses to load from global memory into shared memory.
// Pad shared memory allocation to prevent bank conflicts where possible.
// Consider using __device__ functions for repeated boundary condition logic.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can provide performance benefits.
// If N is not a multiple of block size, handle edge cases to avoid out-of-bounds access.
// Optimize shared memory usage to minimize __syncthreads overhead.
// Ensure global memory writes in c[idx] are coalesced for improved performance.
