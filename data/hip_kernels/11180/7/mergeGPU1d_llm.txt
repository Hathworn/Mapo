```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access to enhance memory throughput
// Minimize branching within the kernel to improve performance
// Balance the use of registers and shared memory to optimize resource use
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy and efficiency
