```
// Use shared memory to store input data tiles to optimize global memory access.
// Increase the block size for better occupancy if shared memory usage allows.
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for src and dest arrays.
// Use texture memory for read-only access patterns to avoid repeated global memory accesses.
