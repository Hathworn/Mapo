```
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced memory access
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance further
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to potentially allow additional compiler optimizations
// Potentially align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
```
