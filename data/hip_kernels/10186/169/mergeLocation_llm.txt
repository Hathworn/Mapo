```c
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for x and y calculations
// Reduce global memory accesses by leveraging shared memory
// Ensure to balance the use of shared memory considering hardware limitations
// Align the block sizes to fit shared memory usage effectively
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after writing to shared memory
// Optimize the block size to match the device's warp size for better performance
