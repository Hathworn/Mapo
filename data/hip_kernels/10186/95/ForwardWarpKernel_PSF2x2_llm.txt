```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as src and flow arrays.
// Optimize global memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access, especially when accessing src, dst, and normalization_factor.
// Reduce divergence by aligning if conditions where applicable to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Consider merging adjacent threads' operations to reduce atomic operations if data consistency allows.
