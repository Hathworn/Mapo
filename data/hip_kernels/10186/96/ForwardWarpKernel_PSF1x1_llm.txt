```c
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for u and v by using shared memory.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for src and dst to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Pre-fetch src data into registers before use to reduce memory latency.
// Ensure stride values allow coalesced accesses across warp for src, u, v, and dst.
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling if applicable depending on the loop structure.
