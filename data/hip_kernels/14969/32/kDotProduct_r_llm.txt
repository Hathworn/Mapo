// Use registers for accumulation to reduce global memory access.
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate results to minimize global memory bandwidth.
// Apply shared memory reduction to improve parallel computation efficiency.
// Ensure balanced workload distribution across threads to optimize performance.
// Use loop-based reduction to manage non-power-of-2 block sizes efficiently.
