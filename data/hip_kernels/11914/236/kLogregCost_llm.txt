// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like maxProbs and labelLogProbs.
// Minimize bank conflicts by accessing shared memory in a coalesced manner.
// Investigate use of texture memory for read-only access to probs and labels.
// Evaluate warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations like numMax calculation.
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers when possible to minimize latency.
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced to increase memory throughput.
