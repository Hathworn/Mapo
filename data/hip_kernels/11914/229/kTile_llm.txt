```
// Use shared memory if possible to cache src data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing tgt array with continuous memory patterns
// Investigate using read-only data cache for src to enhance read efficiency
// Check if warp shuffling techniques can be applied for further optimization
