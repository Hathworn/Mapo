```cpp
// Consider using coalescing memory access for arrays a and b to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Explore the possibility of using warp shuffle functions for intra-warp reduction to reduce the reliance on shared memory
// Ensure maximum occupancy by choosing optimal block size and checking register usage per thread
// Investigate if using a more advanced reduction technique could further enhance performance
