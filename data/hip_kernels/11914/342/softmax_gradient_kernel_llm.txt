```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for Y, dY, and dX arrays.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to synchronize shared memory usage.
// Optimize use of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure all threads within a warp access consecutive memory for optimal performance.
// Implement loop unrolling to improve performance if it fits within the register limit.
