```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure enough threads per block to maintain high occupancy and hide latencies
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Minimize divergent branching to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Consider using constant memory for parameters like fact if they are unchanged
