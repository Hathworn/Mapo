// Consider using shared memory to store values temporarily to avoid repeated global memory access  
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance  
// Utilize warp level operations to minimize divergence and optimize memory transactions  
// Evaluate if loop unrolling provides significant benefits, as hardware optimizations may cover some of these cases  
// Investigate whether textures or read-only data caches may provide faster access for the specific data patterns
