```
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize loop iteration by ensuring stride access to avoid warp divergence.
// Prefetch data to registers before the loop to optimize access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses with warp size.
