```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Apply loop unrolling with best-fit unroll factor for better ILP.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data layout.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if there are no aliasing concerns.
// Experiment with adjusting block size for optimal occupancy and performance.
