```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for better performance
// Leverage shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Use more aggressive unrolling if possible to reduce loop overhead
// Evaluate if using float2 or float4 for data access can improve efficiency
// Check if using atomic operations is more efficient than reduction in this context
```
