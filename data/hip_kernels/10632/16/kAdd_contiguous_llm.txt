```cpp
// Align memory access with coalesced memory patterns
// Ensure memory accesses are within the same warp for optimized throughput
// Consider caching frequently accessed data in shared memory if possible
// Minimize memory access latency by using strided access patterns
// Assess the use of __restrict__ to improve compiler optimizations
```
