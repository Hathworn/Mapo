```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced access
// Reuse loaded data within the block to minimize global memory reads
// Consider prefetching data to reduce wait times
// Group atomic operations to reduce contention
// Minimize the use of atomic operations if possible
