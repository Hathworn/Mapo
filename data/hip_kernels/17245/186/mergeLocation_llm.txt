```
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for loc_, x, and y pointers to optimize memory access
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring global memory writes for x and y are done in a contiguous manner
// Check alignment for loc_ to ensure efficient memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory if applicable to further reduce global memory access
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for this kernel
