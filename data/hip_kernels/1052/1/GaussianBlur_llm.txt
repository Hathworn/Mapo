```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// The mask array can be stored in shared memory to reduce register pressure
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to reduce latency when accessing neighboring pixels
// This might allow further optimization by reducing conditional checks on border pixels
// For non-edge pixels, implement coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth
