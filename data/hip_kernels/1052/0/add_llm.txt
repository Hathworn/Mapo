// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables.
// Optimize thread block size for better hardware utilization.
// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations.
// Use vectorized memory operations if possible to reduce instruction overhead.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
