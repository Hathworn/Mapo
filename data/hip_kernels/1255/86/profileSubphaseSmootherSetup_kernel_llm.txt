```
// Consider assessing if the empty kernel needs any computation.
// If computation is needed, ensure coalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory effectively if data reuse is possible.
// Investigate the possibility of loop unrolling if loops are added.
// Optimize any potential conditionals within the kernel to minimize divergence.
