```cpp
// Optimization: Allocate shared memory if necessary
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Ensure efficient use of allocated shared memory to overlap computation and data transfer

// Optimization: Use threads efficiently
// Optimize thread block size to achieve maximum occupancy
// Use warp-level primitives if applicable for data reuse and coordination

// Optimization: Reduce global memory access, use registers/shared memory
// Cache frequently accessed data in registers for lower latency
// Consider data layout transformations to achieve coalesced memory access
```
