```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for further optimizing global memory access.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure sufficient use of __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions with shared memory.
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives for more efficient parallel processing.
// Review the block and grid size settings to achieve better occupancy and reduce idle threads.
