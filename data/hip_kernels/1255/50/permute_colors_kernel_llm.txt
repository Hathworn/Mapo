```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to exploit cached memory accesses
// Minimize shared memory usage by utilizing registers instead
// Optimize grid-stride loop for better load balancing across threads
// Consider varying block and grid sizes based on problem dimensions
