```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Utilize constant memory for any read-only data that doesn't change during execution.
// Minimize register usage to enable better occupancy.
// Leverage loop unrolling for iterations with a small, fixed count.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring each thread of a warp follows the same execution path.
