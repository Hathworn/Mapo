```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on the specific hardware to maximize occupancy
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses to reduce transaction replays
