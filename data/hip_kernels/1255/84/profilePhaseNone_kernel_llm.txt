```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for efficient memory utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by careful padding and alignment
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when necessary
// Prefetch data into registers to hide global memory latency
// Optimize data layout to improve cache line utilization
```
