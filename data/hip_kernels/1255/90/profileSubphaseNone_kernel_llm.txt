```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Try cooperative groups for efficient data exchange between threads.
// Prefer vectorized loads/stores to utilize memory bandwidth effectively.
// Analyze thread block size for optimal GPU occupancy.
