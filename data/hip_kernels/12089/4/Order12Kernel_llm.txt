// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Load data into shared memory before computations
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses
// Reduce syncthreads calls to improve performance
// Evaluate loop unrolling for repeated computations
// Align data accesses to improve memory throughput
