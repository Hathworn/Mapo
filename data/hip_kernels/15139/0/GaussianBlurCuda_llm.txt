```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for the mask.
// Unroll the inner loops to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Use texture memory for read-only data like pic to take advantage of caching.
// Avoid integer divisions and modulus by using bitwise operations if possible.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data accesses for better throughput.
// Review bank conflicts in shared memory if shared memory is introduced.
