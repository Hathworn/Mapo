```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to gradOutput_data for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Employ loop unrolling in the accumulation loop to maximize throughput.
// Ensure all threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations to benefit from cached reads.
