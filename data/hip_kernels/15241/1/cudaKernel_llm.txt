// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve data reuse.
// Ensure weights are loaded into shared memory in a coalesced manner to improve memory access efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory to store boundary data, reducing redundant global memory accesses.
// Use `__syncthreads()` effectively to prevent race conditions and ensure all threads have completed their tasks before proceeding.
