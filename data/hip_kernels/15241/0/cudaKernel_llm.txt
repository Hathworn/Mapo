```
// Consider loading frequently accessed global data into shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use texture memory or read-only data cache for constant or read-only data to optimize memory bandwidth
// Evaluate using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to fully utilize the GPU's compute capability and memory bandwidth
