```
// Consider coalesced memory access for etau, etav1, and etav2 to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant access to global memory for reused variables like alpha1_sq and alpha0_sq_4.
// Consider loop unrolling for computations involving etau, etav1, and etav2 to maximize performance.
// Ensure data alignment to optimize memory access and reduce memory transaction overhead.
