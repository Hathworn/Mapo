```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory reads for arrays a, b, c, and p.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
// Verify that each thread reads and writes memory in a coalesced pattern.
