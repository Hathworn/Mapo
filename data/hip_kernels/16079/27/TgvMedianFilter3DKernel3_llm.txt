```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for neighboring data.
// Optimize memory coalescing by adjusting the memory access pattern.
// Ensure that all memory accesses are correctly aligned for better performance.
// Explore the use of registers for frequently accessed data to minimize memory latency.
// Analyze if loop unrolling could provide performance benefits in the loading or sorting operations.
