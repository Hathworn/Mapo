```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for global memory
// Use shared memory to cache data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory access is aligned to improve coalescing
// Minimize the use of global memory by utilizing registers efficiently
// Experiment with different block sizes to improve occupancy
```
