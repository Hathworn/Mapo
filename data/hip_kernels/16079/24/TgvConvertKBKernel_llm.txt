```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like disparity to reduce global memory access.
// Unroll the loop in Newton-Raphson iterations to reduce loop overhead.
// Fuse calculations where possible to minimize the number of arithmetic operations.
// Reuse precomputed values across threads to minimize redundant calculations.
// Check if using intrinsics for mathematical functions like sqrtf and tanf improves performance on the target architecture.
