```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for block-wide outputs
// Utilize hardware interpolation for efficient texture sampling
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations when copying to global memory
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a block follow similar execution paths
