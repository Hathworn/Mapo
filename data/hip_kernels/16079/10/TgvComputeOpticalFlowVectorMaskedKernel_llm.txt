```
// Load mask value into a register to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses for warpUV by processing data in contiguous blocks
// Consider using shared memory for temporary variables like 'us' and 'tv2s' to minimize redundant global reads
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to improve coalescing efficiency
// Minimize divergent branching by redesigning the conditional logic if possible
