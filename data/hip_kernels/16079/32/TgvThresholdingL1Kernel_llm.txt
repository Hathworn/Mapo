// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block
// Minimize global memory accesses by using registers for intermediate calculations
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data such as Iu and Iz to exploit spatial locality
// Optimize conditional statements to avoid divergence and improve branch prediction
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory transactions and reduce misaligned accesses
