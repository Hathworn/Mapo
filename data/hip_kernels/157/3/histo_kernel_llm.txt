```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for buffer reading
// Ensure all shared memory accesses are within the warp to prevent bank conflicts
// Utilize vectorized memory loads if possible for improved read efficiency
// Minimize the use of atomic operations in global memory for reduced contention
// Explore loop unrolling for stride iteration to enhance performance
