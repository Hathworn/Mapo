// Use cooperative groups to optimize synchronization and reduce overhead.
// Ensure that threads respect memory coalescing to maximize bandwidth.
// Consider the use of atomic operations for efficient carrying of block sums.
// Optimize stride operations to minimize warp divergence.
// Evaluate the use of persistent threads to handle boundary conditions efficiently.
