```c
// Use shared memory to cache ucharImg data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for ucharImg to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure alignment of ucharImg for potential vectorized loads if hardware supports it
// Check if loop unrolling benefits the computation of grayImg
