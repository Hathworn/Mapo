// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to improve memory access speed.
// Ensure optimal coalesced memory access to global memory.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring conditional statements align across threads within a warp.
// Consider using larger blocks to minimize overhead and improve performance.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce frequent global memory access.
// Unroll loops past a certain threshold for better register utilization.
