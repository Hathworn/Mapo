```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory reads
// Ensure shared memory is utilized effectively to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling for further performance improvement in reduction
// Prefer warp synchronous programming for warp-level reductions to avoid __syncthreads overhead
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring correct memory access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches in warp-level operations
