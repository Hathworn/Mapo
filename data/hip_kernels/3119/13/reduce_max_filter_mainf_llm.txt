```
// Consider using cooperative groups for better warp synchronization.
// Ensure memory alignment to prevent potential bank conflicts.
// Use shared memory more effectively to cache repeated data.
// Minimize global memory accesses via shared memory caching.
// Consider unrolling loops for reduced instruction count and improved pipeline utilization.
// Increase blockSize for better parallelization and memory throughput.
// Prefer atomic operations to handle race conditions efficiently.
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed GPU constraints.
