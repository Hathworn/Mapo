```cpp
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory initialization
// Unroll the loop to process consecutive elements for improved memory access coalescing
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for faster access
// Perform reduction using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Use volatile variables for warp-level reduction to prevent memory access optimization issues
// Ensure warp-level reduction operates without __syncthreads() for active warps
