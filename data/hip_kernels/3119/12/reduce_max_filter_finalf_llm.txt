```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory bandwidth requirements.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to optimize the inner while loop performance.
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is used correctly to prevent race conditions.
// Reduce bank conflicts by accessing shared memory in a coalesced manner.
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for intra-warp reduction to minimize shared memory usage.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed available shared memory per block.
// Use volatile keyword judiciously to prevent compiler optimization from disregarding required memory reads.
