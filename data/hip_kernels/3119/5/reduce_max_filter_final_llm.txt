```c
// Consider coalesced global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use loop unrolling strategically to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
// Leverage shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure aligned memory access to avoid misaligned memory transactions.
// Optimize use of shared memory by limiting the size and scope of variables stored.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring memory access patterns are optimized.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
