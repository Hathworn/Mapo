```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Minimize divergent branches for warp efficiency
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy
// Explore loop unrolling techniques if applicable for performance boost
