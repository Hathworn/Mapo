```
// Consider using shared memory for cache-sensitive data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory coalescing for input and rand arrays to improve access efficiency
// Use __restrict__ keyword on pointers if applicable to inform the compiler about non-aliasing
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and load balancing
