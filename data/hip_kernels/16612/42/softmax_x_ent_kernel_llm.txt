// Optimize memory access by ensuring global memory reads and writes are coalesced
// Consider using shared memory to cache common data if there are shared calculations
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring consistent execution paths within a warp
// Leverage constant memory if there are any constant inputs that can be reused across threads
