```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better bandwidth utilization
// Preloading mean[i] to a register might reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Check if loop unrolling can improve performance by reducing loop overhead
```
