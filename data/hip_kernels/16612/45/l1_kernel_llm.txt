```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements in 'pred', 'truth', 'delta', and 'error'
// Avoid branching where possible to enhance performance; consider using intrinsics and arithmetic operations
// Utilize shared memory if data reuse within a block is needed to further improve access times
// Ensure memory accesses are properly aligned to improve cache utilization and bandwidth efficiency
// Check occupancy and ensure the number of threads per block is optimal for the specific GPU architecture
// Consider loop unrolling if the operation involves repetitive instructions on data
