// Consider using warp shuffles instead of shared memory for intra-block reductions to optimize memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses to global memory for both input and binary arrays.
// Investigate the use of atomic operations or additional warp-level optimizations to further improve reduction efficiency.
