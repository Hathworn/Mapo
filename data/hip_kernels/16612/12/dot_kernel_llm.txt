// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Consider loop unrolling to optimize repeated computations.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced global reads.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to avoid serialization.
// Evaluate different block sizes for optimal occupancy and efficiency.
