```c
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve bandwidth usage
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed portions of X and Y if possible
// Reduce global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to help compiler optimize pointer aliasing
// Avoid bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Consider loop unrolling if it significantly benefits the performance
```
