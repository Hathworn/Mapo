// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for repeated x[idx] calculations.
// Employ warp-level intrinsics for more efficient reduction operations.
// Improve memory coalescing by optimizing access patterns within inner loops.
// Reduce divergence by ensuring that conditional checks are minimized within warp execution.
