```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure pred and truth are aligned for better memory access efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory if applicable to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Verify that n is a multiple of the block size for optimal execution.
