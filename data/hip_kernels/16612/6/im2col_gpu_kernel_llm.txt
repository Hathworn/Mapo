```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced read patterns
// Prefetch global memory into shared memory for faster access
// Align memory accesses to minimize cache misses
// Reduce branching by eliminating conditions inside critical loops
// Parallelize outer loops where possible to improve throughput
