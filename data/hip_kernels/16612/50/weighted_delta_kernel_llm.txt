```
// Consider ensuring memory alignment for optimal access.
// Prefetch data to shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to enhance throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Minimize branching by using conditional assignment techniques.
