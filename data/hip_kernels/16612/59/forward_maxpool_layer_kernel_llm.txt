// Consider coalesced access for 'input' and 'output' using shared memory.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditionals.
// Optimize memory access patterns for better cache utilization.
// Unroll loop iterations to improve pipeline efficiency.
