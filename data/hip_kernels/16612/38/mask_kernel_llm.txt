// Utilize shared memory to cache mask[i] values within blocks for faster access.
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize global memory reads.
// Investigate whether texture memory can be applied for mask array to improve access patterns.
// Ensure thread block is optimally sized for the specific GPU architecture.
