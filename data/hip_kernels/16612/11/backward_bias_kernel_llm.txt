// Consider using loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize use of atomic operations to minimize synchronization overhead
// Ensure alignment of data to improve memory access speed
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal occupancy and performance
