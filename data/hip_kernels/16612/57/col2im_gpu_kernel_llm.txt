```c
// Utilize shared memory to cache blocks of the data_col for faster access
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer arguments to reduce aliasing
// Use cooperative matrix to improve memory coalescing and reduce contention
// Ensure global memory accesses are aligned and coalesced
```
