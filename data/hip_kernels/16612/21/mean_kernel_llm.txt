// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access
// Experiment with loop unrolling for j-loop and k-loop to increase instruction level parallelism
// Assess the benefits of using atomic operations if race conditions are observed in mean calculations
