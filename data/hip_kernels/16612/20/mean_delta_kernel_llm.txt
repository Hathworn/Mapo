// Consider using shared memory for the delta array to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize index calculations by precomputing indices that are reused.
// Utilize loop unrolling techniques to decrease loop overhead and potentially increase performance.
// Evaluate if accessing variance[i] multiple times can be optimized through caching in registers.
