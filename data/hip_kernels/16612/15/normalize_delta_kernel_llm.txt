```
// Consider using shared memory for reusable variables like variance and mean to reduce global memory access within the same block
// Merge variance and mean memory accesses to minimize global memory transactions
// Fuse computations where possible to reduce instruction count, like combining arithmetic operations
// Consider loop unrolling if there are loop-like structures for better instruction-level parallelism
// Explore if pre-fetching data from global memory helps reduce memory latency
