```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for reduced global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous threads access continuous memory locations
// Consider using warp-shuffle operations for efficient intra-warp data exchange
// Minimize atomic operations by restructuring data update patterns to reduce race conditions
