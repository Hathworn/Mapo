```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth
// Ensure data is aligned and padding is minimized to prevent uncoalesced accesses
// Minimize usage of global memory by utilizing registers where possible
// Evaluate loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
