```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by reorganizing data layout if needed.
// Use shared memory to store parts of input data for faster access.
// Minimize global memory accesses; consider registering frequently accessed variables.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to allow for more efficient read/write operations.
// Utilize warp shuffling to reduce the number of overall iterations in loops.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy and performance.
