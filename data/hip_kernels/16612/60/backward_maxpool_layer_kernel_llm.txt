// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations in delta and prev_delta.
// Explore the possibility of using shared memory to store parts of the delta or indexes arrays for faster access.
// Reduce global memory transactions by combining reads where possible.
// Minimize divergence by restructuring conditional statements within the loops, especially the checks on out_w and out_h.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to 32-byte boundaries for optimal performance.
