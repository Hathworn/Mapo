```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for common data like rand
// Unroll loops to minimize branching and improve performance
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using texture memory for repeated read access to image data
// Evaluate using atomic operations if concurrent writes can be avoided
// Check if float operations can benefit from using __fmul_rn for fast multiplication
