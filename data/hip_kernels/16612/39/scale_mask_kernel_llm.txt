```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory allocation for float arrays
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same mask data
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring data in shared memory is accessed in a coalesced manner
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to balance the workload across GPUs
