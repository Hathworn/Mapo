```
// Optimize: Use shared memory for block-level data reuse if applicable
// Suggestion: Coalesce global memory reads by ensuring input[i] accesses are sequential
// Suggestion: Use atomic operations if reduction across threads in a block is needed
// Suggestion: Consider using a different grid dimension to maximize occupancy
