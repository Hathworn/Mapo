// Use shared memory to buffer weight values for reduction, reducing global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing shared memory access.
// Synchronize threads efficiently, minimizing __syncthreads() calls where possible.
// Consider loop unrolling for the reduction process to enhance performance.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy and efficient memory usage.
