```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for X and Y arrays.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers X and Y to facilitate compiler optimizations.
// Consider loop unrolling if INCX or INCY values are known at compile time.
// Use shared memory if there are reused values across threads for further optimization.
// Minimize use of powf by caching ALPHA value if it's constant.
