```
// Combine bounds check to reduce conditional branches
// Precompute the base input index to minimize redundant calculations
// Unroll the loop to improve performance by increased instruction-level parallelism
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within the block is possible
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance
