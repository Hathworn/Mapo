```
// Consider using shared memory if the computation requires more complex operations to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking if INCX is 1 for optimal performance.
// Use texture memory if the data access pattern demonstrates spatial locality.
// Adjust blockDim and gridDim for optimal occupancy to utilize GPU resources efficiently.
// Employ loop unrolling techniques if appropriate to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure the alignment of data if possible to take advantage of memory optimizations.
