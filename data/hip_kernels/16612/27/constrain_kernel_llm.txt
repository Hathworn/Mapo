```
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern by using contiguous memory
// Minimize divergence by avoiding conditional statements in loop
// Optimize occupancy by choosing the right block size
// Leverage shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that N is a multiple of blockDim.x for optimal performance
