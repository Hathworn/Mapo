```c
// Consider using shared memory for reduction to improve memory access speed
// Use vectorized loads/stores if possible to increase memory throughput
// Balance the workload across threads to avoid divergence
// Use __restrict__ keyword on pointer arguments to enhance compiler optimizations
```
