// Use coalesced memory access for gradOutput_data
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring thread workload is uniform
// Consider using shared memory for reducing repeated access to global memory
// Use atomic operations if accumulation might lead to race conditions in more complex scenarios
// Optimize with correct choice of block and grid dimensions based on hardware architecture
