```
// Use shared memory to store probabilities for all threads in a block to improve memory access pattern.
// Prefetch probabilities into registers to hide latency from global memory access.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp take the same execution path as much as possible.
// Reduce the number of operations within the loop with efficient indexing.
// Explore using warp-level primitives for reductions instead of atomic operations for better performance.
// Tune the number of threads per block to ensure full occupancy without underutilizing shared resources.
