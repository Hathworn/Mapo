// Consider using shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize coalescing opportunities
// Ensure the block size is maximized for effective utilization of resources
// Consider using atomic operations for reduction if conflicts arise
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can reduce instruction overhead in loops
