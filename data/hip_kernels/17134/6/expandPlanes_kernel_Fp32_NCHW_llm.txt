```
// Optimize shared memory load by coalescing memory access
// Use fewer shared memory accesses by utilizing shared indices
// Ensure __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce overhead
// Use registers effectively to reduce shared memory usage
// Optimize loop unrolling for parallel utilization
// Align memory access to avoid bank conflicts
