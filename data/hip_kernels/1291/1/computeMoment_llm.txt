```
// Consider using shared memory for reused data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate memory alignment to prevent bank conflicts and optimize access speed.
// Assess the use of texture memory for read-only data as an alternative to global memory.
// Review cache utilization to prevent cache thrashing and improve performance.
