```c
// Use shared memory for weightArr to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure threads from the same warp access shared memory in a coalesced manner.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data to shared memory.
// Consider padding sharedWeightArr to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure all threads within a block participate before __syncthreads() for correct behavior.
```
