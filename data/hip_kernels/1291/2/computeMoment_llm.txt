```
// Consider using more threads to load weightArr to shared memory to reduce serialization.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive elements for readArr.
// Check if MIN_MARGIN boundaries can be expanded to reduce edge case handling overhead.
// Evaluate if using float for influence can be optimized to reduce precision issues or overhead.
// Investigate potential for loop unrolling in the nested loops to increase pipeline efficiency.
// Assess if usage of warp shuffle instructions could benefit the influence calculation.
