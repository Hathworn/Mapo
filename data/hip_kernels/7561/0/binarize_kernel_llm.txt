```
// Consider using shared memory if frequent access to x is required by many threads
// Use memory coalescing techniques to improve global memory access patterns
// Attempt to ensure that binary[i] is accessed in a coalesced manner
// Evaluate the benefit of loop unrolling for this operation
// Profile the kernel to determine if occupancy optimization is necessary
