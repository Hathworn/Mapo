```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for data frequently accessed within the block
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access
// Minimize register usage within the kernel if possible
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance within the while loop
// Check the occupancy and adjust block size accordingly
// Ensure that all memory allocations are aligned to improve access speed
