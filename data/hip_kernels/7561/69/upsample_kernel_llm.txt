// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergent branches to optimize thread execution efficiency.
// Evaluate loop unrolling or warp-level operations to reduce unnecessary control overhead.
