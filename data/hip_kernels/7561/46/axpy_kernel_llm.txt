```
// Ensure memory coalescing by using a strided loop
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize the use of magic numbers in grid and block calculations
// Avoid warp divergence by aligning data access with thread ID
// Potentially unroll the loop for performance gains
