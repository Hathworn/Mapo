```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if needed.
// Consider using a larger block size for better memory throughput.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for the 'src' array.
// Explore using asynchronous memory operations for potential overlap with computation.
// Check if vectorized memory stores can be utilized for enhanced performance.
