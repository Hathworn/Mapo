```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for both x and mask arrays.
// Ensure that block size is a multiple of warp size for optimal execution.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same memory locations.
