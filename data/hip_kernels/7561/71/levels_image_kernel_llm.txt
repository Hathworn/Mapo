```
// Consider coalesced memory access for image reading and writing to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed values like rand elements to reduce global memory accesses
// Reduce divergent branching in if conditions where possible
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately if shared memory is implemented for synchronization
```
