```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to coalesce reads and writes.
// Ensure the index computation minimizes divergent branches.
// Reduce the use of atomic operations if possible, to improve performance.
// Assess if padding can be minimized or simplified for better efficiency.
