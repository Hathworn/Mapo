```
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring INCX is 1 or a small stride
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access if repeated reads occur
// Consider using warp shuffle functions to reduce memory traffic when updating X
// Ensure ALPHA is stored in a register to speed up accesses
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy based on hardware specifications
```
