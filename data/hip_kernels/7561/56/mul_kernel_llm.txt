```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking memory alignment with INCX and INCY
// Explore loop unrolling if INCX or INCY is a compile-time constant
// Evaluate occupancy and grid size to maximize parallelism and resource utilization
// Profile and align data accesses to take advantage of memory burst coalescing
