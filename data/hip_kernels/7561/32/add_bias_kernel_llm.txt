```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize the number of divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory if there are opportunities for data reuse within a block.
// Use appropriate compiler flags to optimize performance for targeted hardware architecture.
