```
// Combine index calculations into fewer operations to reduce instruction count
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses across threads
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory traffic
// Consider loop unrolling for the calculations if the compiler does not optimize automatically
