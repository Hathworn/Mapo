```
// Use shared memory to cache input data within each block to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for loading input and weights
// Use loop unrolling for the filter height and width loops for increased performance
// Minimize divergent branches due to boundary checks by calculating valid start and end points for x and y
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
