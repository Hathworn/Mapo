```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for pred and truth arrays
// Apply thread-level parallelism by optimizing block and grid size
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory throughput
// Minimize branch divergence in conditional operations
// Consider prefetching data to enhance access efficiency
