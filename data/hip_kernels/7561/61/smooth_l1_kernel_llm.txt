```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Utilize shared memory if there are common sub-expressions suitable for reuse.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to maximize instruction throughput.
// Profile for potential memory bank conflicts and optimize accordingly.
// Apply half2 data types for vectorized operations if applicable.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes for hardware efficiency.
