```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by properly aligning the data when accessing `x` and `out` arrays.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access and increase data reuse.
// Consider using vectorized memory accesses for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize thread block size and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and throughput.
// Assess potential warp divergence and minimize conditional branching in the kernel.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce the global memory access latency.
