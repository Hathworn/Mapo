```
// Use shared memory to cache 'delta' and 'indexes' to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize the loop structure to maximize coalesced memory access patterns
// Consider preloading data for threads to improve memory access efficiency
// Reuse memory accesses wherever possible within the loop
// Minimize divergent branches inside the loop to reduce warp serialization
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
