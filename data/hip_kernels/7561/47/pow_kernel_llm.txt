```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure memory coalescing by working with consecutive floats for better memory access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Make sure the kernel is launched with occupancy in mind to fully utilize GPU resources.
