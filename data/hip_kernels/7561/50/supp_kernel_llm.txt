```
// Combine kernel launches or use occupancy calculator to find optimal block size
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable for pointers to improve compiler optimization
// Consider using warp shuffle functions to reduce shared memory usage
// Ensure proper coalesced memory access patterns for X array
// Profile memory bandwidth and use asynchronous memory transfers if applicable
// Review load/store instructions for potential improvements with vectorized types
