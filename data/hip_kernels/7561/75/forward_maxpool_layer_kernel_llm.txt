```
// Consider using shared memory for the input array chunks to reduce global memory access latency
// Explore warp-level operations to further minimize control overhead in the unrolled loops
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring memory coalescing in the input array access
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditionals inside loops
