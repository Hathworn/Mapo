// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to maximize throughput.
// Consider aligning data in shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Investigate unrolling loops for improved performance.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory to optimize read operations.
// Ensure that array 'weights' is stored in a contiguous memory layout.
