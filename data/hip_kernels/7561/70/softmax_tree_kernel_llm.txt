```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for input values for coalesced access and reduced global memory transactions.
// Use warp synchronization and warp-level primitives for parallel reduction to optimize largest element computation.
// Apply loop unrolling for the computation loops to enhance performance.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce latency and improve access speed.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced writes in output storage.
// Reduce synchronization overhead by minimizing __syncthreads() usage where possible.
