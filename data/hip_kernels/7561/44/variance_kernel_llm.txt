```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache mean values for faster access within threads
// Balance the workload across threads to eliminate any unnecessary unused threads
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput and reduce control overhead
// Minimize the use of powf by replacing with simple arithmetic operations where possible
// Coalesce memory access patterns for x and variance arrays for better memory throughput
```
