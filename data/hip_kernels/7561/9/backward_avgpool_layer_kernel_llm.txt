```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure proper alignment to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better memory coalescing
// Maximize occupancy by tuning block and grid sizes
// Optimize loop unrolling further for reduced instruction overhead
```
