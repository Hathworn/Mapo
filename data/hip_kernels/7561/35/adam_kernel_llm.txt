```c
// Precompute reused variables outside of the per-thread scope to save computation
// Consider aligning data in memory to improve cache utilization and access time
// Minimize global memory access by reusing values within the registers
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for x, m, and v arrays
// Prefetch data into shared memory if applicable and beneficial
```
