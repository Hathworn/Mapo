```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions and improve memory access speed
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to further enhance memory efficiency
// Optimize data reuse within each block to minimize global memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure memory alignment in global memory accesses for better performance
// Consider employing loop unrolling further in reduction to enhance computational throughput
