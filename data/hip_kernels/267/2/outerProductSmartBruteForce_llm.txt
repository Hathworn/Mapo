```
// Consider using shared memory to cache vec elements and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having consecutive threads access consecutive elements in vec
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by organizing data layout properly
