// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced by aligning block and thread indices properly.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by carefully organizing shared memory indices.
// Optimize the loop that iterates over shared memory blocks to avoid unnecessary computations.
// Reduce __syncthreads() calls where possible to minimize synchronization overhead.
