```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when loading data from global memory
// Ensure data is stored in shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Leverage __syncthreads() to synchronize threads to ensure data consistency in shared memory
// Utilize loop unrolling pragmas to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Optimize tile size for the best occupancy and usage of shared memory
