```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve cache efficiency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance in small fixed-size loops.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Use registers to hold frequently accessed data for faster computation.
// Check if texture memory or read-only cache could benefit access patterns for constant data.
