```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for data and n_xy_coords to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory when accessing n_xy_coords.
// Use shared memory to load blocks of data if there are reuse opportunities across threads.
// Optimize index computations to reduce redundant arithmetic operations.
// Ensure memory accesses are within bounds to prevent out-of-bounds errors.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to take advantage of cache for frequently accessed data.
