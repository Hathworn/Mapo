```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory access for `queue`, `startPoints`, `endPoints`, and `weightArray` 
// Ensure `parentArray` and `resultWeightArray` are accessed efficiently to improve cache usage
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to reduce contention
// Evaluate the possibility of using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block
