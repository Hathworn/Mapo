```cpp
// Coalesce global memory accesses for better memory throughput by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements.
// Minimize memory accesses by storing frequently used global memory data in shared memory or registers.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce contention and increase parallelism when updating shared variables like queueSize.
// Ensure thread blocks are fully occupied to maximize the utilization of GPU resources.
// Reduce branching divergence by structuring conditional statements to minimize varying execution paths within a warp.
