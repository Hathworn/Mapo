```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to achieve better performance.
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Maximize occupancy by adjusting block and grid dimensions.
