// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if multiple threads within a block access the same data
// Seed setup can be done in a more memory-efficient manner if possible, consider using fewer unique seeds
// Consider using warp-level operations to reduce divergence and synchronization overhead
// Ensure alignment to avoid misaligned accesses which result in lower memory bandwidth
