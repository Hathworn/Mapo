```
// Use shared memory to cache row_sum locally for faster access
// Use shared memory to cache col_sum locally for faster access
// Consider coalesced memory access for output array
// Optimize loop to reduce divergent warps
// Prefetch data for col_sum to minimize memory latency
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to avoid bank conflicts
