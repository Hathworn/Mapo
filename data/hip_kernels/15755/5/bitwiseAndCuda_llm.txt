```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to store local data for each block to improve memory access speed
// Ensure data alignment to prevent potential memory access penalties
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory if used
// Optimize block and grid size for maximum occupancy and efficiency
// Utilize __syncthreads() appropriately if using shared memory to avoid race conditions
