```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for pixel data.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries.
// Avoid divergent warp execution by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Prefetch data in registers to reduce latency of memory accesses.
// Increase occupancy by adjusting block size based on GPU architecture specifications.
// Use texture memory for read-only input data to take advantage of cache mechanisms.
