```
// Use shared memory for value array to reduce global memory access latency
// Only load value array into shared memory once per block to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Employ early exit strategy for threads outside the image bounds to save computation
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming for more efficient synchronization, if applicable
// Optimize search loop in shared memory to potentially use binary search if values are sorted
// Limit the use of atomic operations as they can be a bottleneck; consider alternative reduction methods if feasible
