```
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data access patterns
// Minimize global memory transactions by reducing address calculations
// Evaluate if shared memory can be advantageous for frequently accessed data
// Check if memory access is aligned and coalesced
// Consider loop unrolling for performance enhancement
// Use as few registers as possible to avoid register spilling
// Ensure optimal grid and block size configuration for better occupancy
