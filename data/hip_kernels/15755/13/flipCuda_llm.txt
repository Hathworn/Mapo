```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Minimize branching by replacing if-else statements with conditional expressions
// Consider using shared memory if input data reuse within the block is needed
// Align data structures to improve global memory access patterns
// Evaluate if using texture memory offers benefits for 2D spatial locality
