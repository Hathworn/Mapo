// Consider coalesced memory access by processing consecutive data elements in a warp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access when processing blocks
// Explore use of more appropriate data types (e.g., int32) to reduce memory transactions
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to better utilize GPU resources
