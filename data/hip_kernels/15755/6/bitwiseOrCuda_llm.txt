// Consider using shared memory for loading input data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses by arranging data accesses using warp-friendly patterns.
// Use constant memory for any constants or read-only data to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size or register usage to maximize hardware utilization.
