```cpp
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to store intermediate results
// Reduce global memory transactions through local aggregation in shared memory
// Use atomic operations in shared memory to avoid global memory access collision
// Minimize synchronization by reducing syncthreads use only when necessary
```
