// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve memory access
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting indexing patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like variance and mean
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by careful data placement
// Optimize memory access patterns for better cache utilization
// Use atomic operations for shared data updates if required
