```c
// Consider using shared memory for partial sums to optimize memory access.
// Unroll the inner loop for spatial to increase instruction throughput.
// Try coalesced memory access patterns for the delta array.
// Use asynchronous memory operations if the data allows.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency.
