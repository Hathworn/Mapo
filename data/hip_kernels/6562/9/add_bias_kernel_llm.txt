// Consider coalescing memory access for output and biases
// Ensure biases are loaded into shared memory for faster access
// Reduce global memory load by storing indexes in registers
// Align data types for better memory load/store efficiency
// Reassess the choice of gridDim and blockDim for optimal occupancy
