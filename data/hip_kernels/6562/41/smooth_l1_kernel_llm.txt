```
// Use shared memory for cache-friendly access to frequently used data
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead within the if condition
// Align memory accesses to improve data-fetching efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
