// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider aligning data structures or padding to ensure no bank conflicts
// Utilize shared memory if applicable to reduce repetitive global memory access
// Profiling might reveal potential warp divergence; address if feasible
// Optimize the loop for better occupancy by adjusting block and grid size
