```
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy
// Reuse data loaded in registers where possible to reduce global memory access
// Align memory access patterns to leverage coalesced memory transactions
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads within the warp
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory throughput
