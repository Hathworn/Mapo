// Consider using shared memory for blocks to reduce global memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling to decrease the number of iterations and improve instruction-level parallelism
// Calculate 'batch * spatial' outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations
// Apply the calculated scale at the end to minimize operations within the loop
