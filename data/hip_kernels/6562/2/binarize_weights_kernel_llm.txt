```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory is being utilized effectively by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Optimize the loop to reduce the number of synchronizations needed.
// Implement loop unrolling to further improve performance.
// Evaluate whether increasing block size provides better performance for this kernel.
// Make sure that each thread accesses consecutive memory locations to enhance cache performance.
