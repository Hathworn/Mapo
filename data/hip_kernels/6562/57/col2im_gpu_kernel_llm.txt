```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache data_col elements to reuse memory efficiently.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access by appropriately aligning data.
// Unroll loops for h_col and w_col to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for loading data from global memory to reduce memory latency.
// Use proper grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and ensure efficient execution.
// Evaluate if the atomicAdd operation can be reduced or avoided to minimize synchronization overhead.
