```
// Combine index calculations to reduce instruction count and improve readable code
// Minimize conditional branching to enhance performance
// Use shared memory where beneficial to reduce global memory access and latency
// Ensure all global memory accesses are coalesced
// Leverage constant memory for invariant inputs
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming to increase efficiency
