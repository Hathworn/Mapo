```
// Unroll inner loops to enhance data locality and increase parallelism
// Use shared memory judiciously to reduce global memory accesses
// Pre-fetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy and performance
// Align memory accesses to coalesced patterns for improved memory bandwidth
// Minimize branch divergence by simplifying conditional operations
```
