// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads within softmax_device.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to improve throughput in the largest value computation.
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning input and output accesses to avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate the possibility of using warp shuffles to perform reduction operations efficiently.
// Investigate if persistent threads can maintain occupancy and reduce kernel launch overhead.
// Check the possibility of using atomic operations for any necessary synchronization.
