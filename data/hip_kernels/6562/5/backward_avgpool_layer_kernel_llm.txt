```
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for in_delta for potential memory coalescing.
// Ensure that in_delta and out_delta are aligned to enable coalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory to cache out_delta data if bandwidth is a concern.
// Prefetch out_delta[out_index] into a register to reduce global memory access.
// Check if the loop can be unrolled to reduce instruction overhead.
// Align access patterns to ensure global memory transactions are optimized.
