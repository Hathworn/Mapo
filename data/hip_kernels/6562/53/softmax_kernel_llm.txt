```c
// Use shared memory for coalesced access to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Consider thread block size adjustments to maximize device occupancy.
// Optimize memory usage by ensuring shared memory size aligns with warp size.
// Implement loop unrolling in the parallel reduction for finding the maximum value.
// Look into using warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Apply atomic operations carefully to minimize contention and ensure performance.
// Analyze vectorized memory access to enhance access patterns.
