```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to optimize memory bandwidth
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find optimal configuration
// Minimize the divergence within warp to improve performance
