```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input values for faster access
// Use loop unrolling to optimize the reduction operation in the loop
// Explore using warp-level primitives for efficient reduction
// Organize memory access in a coalesced manner to improve throughput
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target GPU
