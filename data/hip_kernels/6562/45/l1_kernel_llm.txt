```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Avoid branch divergence by using intrinsic functions
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve read/write efficiency
// Ensure enough threads are launched to cover the entire data set
// Minimize the use of expensive operations within the kernel
