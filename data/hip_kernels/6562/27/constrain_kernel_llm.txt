```c
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data elements.
// Optimize thread block size to better suit the GPU architecture.
// Avoid divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
