```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing consecutive elements
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated read data from global memory
// Aim to minimize divergent branches within the warp
// Unroll loops to improve instruction throughput if size is known at compile time
// Balance grid and block sizes to match the GPU architecture for better occupancy
