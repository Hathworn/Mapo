// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data to warp boundaries
// Consider using shared memory for mean and variance to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Ensure that the memory for mean and variance is cached effectively using __ldg for read-only access
// Evaluate occupancy and explore the use of appropriate grid and block dimensions to maximize utilization
