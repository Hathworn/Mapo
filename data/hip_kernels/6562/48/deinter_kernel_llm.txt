```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking memory alignment
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp efficiency
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Explore the use of float4 for coalesced access in cases with contiguous memory
// Consider loop unrolling to optimize the loop execution
// Adjust grid and block sizes based on hardware architecture for improved performance
// Use asynchronous memory transfers where applicable to hide memory latency
