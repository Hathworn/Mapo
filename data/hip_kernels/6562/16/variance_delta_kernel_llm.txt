```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory performance
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses within loops
// Try vectorizing operations to take advantage of hardware capabilities
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory transaction efficiency
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditional logic where possible
