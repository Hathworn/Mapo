```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for x and dx
// Use shared memory more effectively by minimizing bank conflicts
// Ensure synchronization uses __syncthreads() only when necessary
// Optimize the use of atomic operations to prevent contention
// Consider loop unrolling for the normalization step to improve performance
