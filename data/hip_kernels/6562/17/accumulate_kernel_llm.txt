```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for x to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all shared memory operations are complete before writing to sum
// Optimize thread block size to better match GPU architecture for improved performance
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to further enhance computational efficiency in the loop
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to minimize bank conflicts
// Experiment with different execution configurations to achieve optimal resource utilization
