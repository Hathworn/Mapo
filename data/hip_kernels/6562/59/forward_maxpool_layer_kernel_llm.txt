```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache input tiles and further reduce global memory access.
// Reduce redundant calculations by storing frequently used indices or expressions.
// Look into using vectorized memory access to coalesce memory operations.
// Optimize thread block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and better match warp sizes.
// Use constant memory for parameters that do not change and are repeatedly accessed.
// Analyze the divergent branches in the loop and attempt to minimize divergence.
