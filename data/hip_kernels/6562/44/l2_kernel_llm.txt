```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive elements
// Consider using shared memory if the data is reused among threads
// Optimize memory access patterns for better cache performance
// Check for potential bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Utilize warp-level primitives to reduce latency in calculations if applicable
// Balance the workload among threads to avoid idle threads
