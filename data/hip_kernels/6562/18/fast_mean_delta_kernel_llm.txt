```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread indices with memory locations.
// Prefetch data to reduce global memory latency by amortizing access cost over iterations.
// Use shared memory to save intermediate results and reduce global memory traffic.
// Implement warp-level reduction to minimize synchronization and improve efficiency.
// Optimize synchronization by reducing the number of __syncthreads() calls.
// Consider using atomic operations if applicable to avoid the final step loop.
