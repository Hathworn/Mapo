```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structure offset and stride.
// Minimize warp divergence by avoiding conditional statements inside the critical path.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques if further performance improvements are needed.
