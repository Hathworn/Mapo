```cpp
// Use shared memory for faster data access and accumulation
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by each thread
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use warp-level primitives for efficient intra-warp reduction
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed-size operations
// Manage occupancy to balance between latency hiding and shared memory usage
```
