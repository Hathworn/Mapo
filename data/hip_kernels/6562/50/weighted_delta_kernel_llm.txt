```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use more warps and smaller block size for better memory latency hiding
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers to reduce latency
// Minimize use of global memory by reusing loaded data within the loop
// Ensure stride access pattern to leverage memory coalescing
// Check if `da`, `db`, and `ds` can be accessed in a coalesced manner
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling might reduce overhead in the loop
