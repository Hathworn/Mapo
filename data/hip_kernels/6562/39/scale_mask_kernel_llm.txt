```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for reuse and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns.
// Experiment with different block sizes for improved occupancy and execution efficiency.
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable to inform compiler about non-aliasing pointers.
