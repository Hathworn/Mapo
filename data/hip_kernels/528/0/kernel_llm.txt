```
//Consider using coalesced memory accesses by storing adj_mat in column-major order
//Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
//Use double buffering in shared memory to hide memory latency
//Apply loop unrolling in the inner loop for col_idx to increase instruction-level parallelism
//Minimize usage of global memory by caching cap_max_mat into shared memory
//Evaluate the use of texture memory for visited array to benefit from cached reads
