// Use shared memory to store pixel values within the blur window to reduce global memory accesses.
// Rearrange loops to ensure coalesced memory access patterns for d_inputArray.
// Consider using texture memory which can provide cached memory access for repetitive read patterns.
// Check for bank conflicts within shared memory usage if implemented.
