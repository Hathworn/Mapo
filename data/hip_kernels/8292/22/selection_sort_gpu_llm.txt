```
// Consider using loop unrolling to enhance performance in the inner loops
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for reading data into shared memory
// Consider optimizing for memory bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Ensure enough shared memory per block based on n, adjust block size as necessary
// Check occupancy and adjust block size or use `__launch_bounds__` for hardware constraints
