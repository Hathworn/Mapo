```
// Pre-fetch as much data as possible into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to further reduce the loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations in global memory
// Align data structures and types to 16-, 32-, or 64-byte boundaries for better memory throughput
// Reduce divergent branches within the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
