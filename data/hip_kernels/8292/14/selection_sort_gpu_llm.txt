```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning accesses within the warp
// Use shared memory to buffer data and reduce global memory access
// Leverage loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize the reduction in the inner loop
// Ensure proper synchronization after the initial copy to enable correct operation on shared data
