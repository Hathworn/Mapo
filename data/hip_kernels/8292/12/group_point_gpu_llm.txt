```
// Consider coalesced memory access for points and idx arrays.
// Review usage of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Evaluate loop unrolling to optimize for the c dimension loop.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate use of warp-level primitives for further optimization.
// Optimize stride and grid configurations based on GPU architecture.
