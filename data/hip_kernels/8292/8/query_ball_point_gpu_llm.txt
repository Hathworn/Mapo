```
// Use shared memory to cache xyz2 coordinates for each block to reduce global memory access.
// Loop unrolling for improving instruction-level parallelism and reducing loop overhead.
// Check memory coalescing for writing current_idx array to enhance global memory throughput.
// Prefetch the radius value into a register to avoid redundant global memory reads.
