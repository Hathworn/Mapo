// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring data access patterns are aligned.
// Assess use of atomic operations for potential bottlenecks; explore warp-level reduction strategies.
// Re-evaluate stride and batch indexing for potential memory access inefficiencies.
