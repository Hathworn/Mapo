```
// Consider coalescing memory access for xyz1 and xyz2 for better memory performance.
// Reduce the number of sqrtf() calls by comparing squared distances.
// Use shared memory to cache xyz2 for faster access if memory is reused.
// Use a different indexing strategy to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Consider using __shfl_down_sync or warp shuffle operations for thread communication if needed.
// Minimize branch divergence by sorting or grouping threads with similar control flows.
