```c
// Consider using shared memory for repeated loads of xyz1 to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement loop unrolling for the loop iterating over 'k' to enhance ILP.
// Prefetch radius[0] outside the loop over 'k' to minimize memory latency.
// Use squared distance comparison instead of calculating square root for performance gain.
// Combine multiple conditional checks within the loop to reduce control divergence.
// Align memory accesses to prevent bank conflicts and optimize memory coalescing.
