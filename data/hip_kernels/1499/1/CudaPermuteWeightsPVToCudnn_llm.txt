```
// Use shared memory for intermediate storage to reduce redundant global memory access
// Consider using memory coalescing techniques to improve the access pattern of global memory
// Investigate the possibility of loop unrolling for reducing instruction overhead
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() if shared memory is utilized to avoid race conditions
// Analyze if texture memory can be leveraged for read-only data access for improved cache efficiency
