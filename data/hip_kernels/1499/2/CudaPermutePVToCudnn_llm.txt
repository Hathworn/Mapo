```c
// Pre-calculate destination parameters to minimize repeated computations.
// Ensure that shared memory or local memory is used effectively to cache data.
// Minimize the divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Use coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory reads and writes.
// Consider block size and grid size that best utilize the hardware for better performance.
// Avoid using too many registers per thread to increase occupancy.
