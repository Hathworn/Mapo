```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Employ shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Reduce bank conflicts by aligning shared memory allocation
// Consider loop unrolling if indexing pattern allows for it
