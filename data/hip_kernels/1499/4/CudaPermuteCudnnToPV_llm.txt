```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant data fetches from global memory
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and hide latency
// Evaluate if a texture or cache could optimize memory access patterns given usage constraints
// Revisit grid and block configurations to ensure all elements are covered without divergence
```
