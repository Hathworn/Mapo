```
// Reduce redundant calculations of newpos within the loop
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequent data access
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure that computations within the kernel maximize instruction throughput and minimize diverging branches
