```
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for coalesced memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for the scale_factor loops if it is a compile-time constant
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if data does not overlap
// Minimize the use of global memory by using registers when possible
