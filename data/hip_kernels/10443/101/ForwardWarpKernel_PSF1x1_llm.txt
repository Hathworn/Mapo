```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when reading u, v, and src arrays.
// Consider loop unrolling for any significant repetitive computation within the kernel.
// Profile the kernel for warp divergence to ensure optimal branching.
// Consider using a larger block size for better occupancy based on device specifications.
