```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to improve data reuse and reduce global memory access
// Consider grid-stride loops for handling images larger than grid size
// Align data allocations to avoid memory misalignment and potential bank conflicts
// Utilize asynchronous memory copy operations for overlapping data transfer and computation
