```cpp
// Ensure memory access patterns leverage coalesced memory accesses
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Utilize appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and efficient memory usage
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied to improve performance
// Monitor bank conflicts in shared memory if implemented
```
