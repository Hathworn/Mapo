```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for maxProbs and labelLogProbs
// Prefetch data into shared memory using cooperative fetching to minimize latency
// Unroll loop further if numOut is known at compile time to reduce branch overhead
// Use vectorized memory loads where possible to improve memory throughput
// Consider using texture memory for reading probs if access patterns are suitable
