```
// Use coalesced memory access for arrays a and b to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Increase the occupancy by choosing an appropriate block size (DP_BLOCKSIZE) that maximizes the use of shared memory and CUDA cores.
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching to hide global memory latency.
/// Ensure that any read-write accesses to shared memory (shmem) are properly aligned and minimized to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use atomic operations or a separate kernel for final reduction across blocks if target array will be further reduced.
