// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in M and N
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling within the inner compute loop for better performance
// Assess the use of constant memory for frequently accessed, read-only data
// Investigate potential warp divergence caused by the boundary condition checks
// Increase tile size if registers and shared memory allow, for larger computations per block
