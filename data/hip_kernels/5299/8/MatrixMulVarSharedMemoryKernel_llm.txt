```
// Use loop-specific conditions directly to minimize branching
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Reduce use of conditional instructions by simplifying control flow
// Aggressively use shared memory for caching block data
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop for potential performance gains
// Ensure coalesced access for both reads from global memory and writes to global memory
