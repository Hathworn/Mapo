```c
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced reads.
// Ensure data alignment to reduce misaligned memory access overhead.
// Minimize memory transactions by reorganizing data structures if possible.
// Use memory prefetching techniques to hide latency.
