```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when reading and writing global memory to improve efficiency.
// Minimize memory accesses by reusing data from shared memory whenever possible.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not cause bank conflicts for optimal performance.
// Consider increasing block size to maximize occupancy, but ensure it does not exceed shared memory limits.
