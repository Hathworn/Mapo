```c
// Consider using coalesced memory access by aligning input data to warp boundaries
// Use bank conflict-free access patterns for shared memory
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy based on device-specific characteristics
// Prefetch data where possible to hide global memory latency
// Minimize unnecessary __syncthreads() calls to reduce synchronization overhead
// Evaluate performance impact of using atomic operations for final output reduction
