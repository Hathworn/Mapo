```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for matrix tiles
// Ensure memory coalescing in global memory transactions
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Synchronize threads to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity
// Load data from global memory to shared memory efficiently
// Minimize redundant computation and memory operations
// Maximize occupancy by optimizing tile size and grid configuration
```
