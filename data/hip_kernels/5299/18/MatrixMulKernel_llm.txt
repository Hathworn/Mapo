```
// Use coalesced memory accesses when loading data into shared memory
// Ensure shared memory is fully utilized to optimize memory bandwidth
// Consider adjusting BLOCK_SIZE to fit within available shared memory and reduce bank conflicts
// Unroll loops to improve instruction throughput and latency hiding
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() where possible to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider using float2 or float4 for loading/storing multiple elements at once to optimize vectorized memory operations
