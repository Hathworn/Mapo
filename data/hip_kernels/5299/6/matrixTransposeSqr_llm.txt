```
// Use shared memory to improve access speed as it is faster than global memory
// Ensure all threads load data into shared memory before proceeding
// Tile dimensions should match block dimensions to maximize shared memory utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring memory access patterns are coalesced
// Ensure xIdx and yIdx recalculations after transposition step
// Reduce global memory access by reusing data stored in shared memory
