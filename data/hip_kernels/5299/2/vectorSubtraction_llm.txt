// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring contiguous memory access for thread blocks.
// Use shared memory for repetitive access data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Balance the workload across the threads to ensure efficient utilization.
// Optimize block and grid size to maximize GPU occupancy.
