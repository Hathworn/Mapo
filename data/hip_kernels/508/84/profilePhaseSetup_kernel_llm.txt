```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Adjust the working data set size for optimal block and grid configuration
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data appropriately
// Use proper synchronization techniques if shared memory is implemented
// Experiment with different block sizes to achieve maximum occupancy
