```
// Consider coalesced memory access if the kernel were to process data
// Implement shared memory usage to reduce global memory traffic if handling larger data sets
// Explore memory access patterns for reducing bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use loop unrolling strategies if iterations are present in future versions
