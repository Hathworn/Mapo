```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit the specific computation involved.
// Leverage register usage effectively to minimize memory latency.
// Consider warp synchronization to prevent thread divergence.
