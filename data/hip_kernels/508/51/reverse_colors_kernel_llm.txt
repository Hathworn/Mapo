```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are set such that they maximize occupancy and fully utilize the GPU
// Use shared memory if applicable to store frequently accessed data within threads of a block
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain GPU warp efficiency
