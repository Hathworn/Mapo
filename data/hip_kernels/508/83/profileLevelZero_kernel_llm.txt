// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize cache misses
// Align memory accesses to warp size for efficient data transfer
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
