```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved performance
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Use `__syncthreads()` judiciously to optimize parallel execution
// Ensure global memory access patterns are efficient
// Reduce register usage by optimizing shared data
// Take advantage of memory alignment for faster access
