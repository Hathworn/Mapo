```
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy and performance
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced accesses by aligning data structures in memory
// Use `__syncthreads()` to synchronize threads when using shared memory
// Prefetch data to shared memory outside of loops for improved efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce control overhead and improve performance
```
