// Use shared memory for frequently accessed node data such as rat counts to reduce global memory accesses.
// Organize memory access patterns for neighbor and node_weight arrays to improve coalescing.
// Consider vectorization for operations if applicable, but test the impact on performance.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling is beneficial given this specific use case and data size.
// Balance atomic operations across multiple threads to minimize contention and maximize throughput.
