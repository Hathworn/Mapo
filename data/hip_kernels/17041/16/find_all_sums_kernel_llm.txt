```
// Consider coalesced access for node_weight array to optimize memory access.
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop for better warp execution efficiency.
// Implement shared memory caching for frequently accessed neighbor data.
// Consider using atomic operations if concurrent writes to neighbor_accum_weight_result cause race conditions.
// Explore leveraging texture memory for node_weight if data reuse is high.
