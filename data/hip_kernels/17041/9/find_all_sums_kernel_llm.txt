```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve throughput
// Use more registers to lower the number of shared memory accesses
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing the size of shared_weights when possible
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls to only when truly necessary
// Consider prefetching node_weight and neighbor data to shared memory earlier
// Reduce conditional branches for better warp execution
