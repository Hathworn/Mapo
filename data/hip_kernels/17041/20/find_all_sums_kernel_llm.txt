```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for neighbor and node_weight arrays to optimize bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Opt for loop unrolling in the accumulation loop to optimize arithmetic operations.
// Try reducing synchronization overhead by grouping threads that have active nodes.
// Analyze and minimize divergent executions paths especially with conditional checks.
