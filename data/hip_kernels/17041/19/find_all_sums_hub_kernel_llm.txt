```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory locations
// Try to avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Review loop unrolling to determine if it effectively overlaps computation with memory latency
// Analyze if asynchronous memory prefetching can be used to further optimize memory access patterns
