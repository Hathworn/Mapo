```
// Use shared memory to cache node_weight values to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced access to the neighbor and node_weight arrays for better performance.
// Consider increasing block size to optimize occupancy and throughput.
// Apply data prefetching techniques to hide memory latency.
