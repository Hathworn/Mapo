```cpp
// Use registers to minimize global memory access and avoid repeated computations
// Consider using shared memory if neighboring threads access overlapping data
// Coalesce memory accesses to the node_weight array for better performance
// Minimize branching inside loops to reduce divergence in warps
// Ensure alignment of data structures for optimal memory access
// Evaluate use of texture memory for potentially better cache utilization
