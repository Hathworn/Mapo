// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to cache node weights
// Reduce global memory access by caching node_weight in shared memory
// Ensure all threads synchronize after writing to shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block
// Ensure each thread reads from the cached shared memory instead of global memory
