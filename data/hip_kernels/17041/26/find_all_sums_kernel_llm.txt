// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve efficiency.
// Optimize synchronization by reducing the number of __syncthreads() statements.
// Ensure memory access is aligned to prevent bank conflicts or misaligned access penalties.
// Minimize redundant memory loads by caching data in shared memory where possible.
