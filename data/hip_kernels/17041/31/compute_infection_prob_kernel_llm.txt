```
// Use shared memory to store rat_counts for better memory access patterns.
// Consider memory coalescing for accessing infectious_rat_count and exposed_rat_count.
// Minimize arithmetic and division by precalculating constants that do not change per iteration.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to utilize the texture cache for infectious_rat_count and exposed_rat_count.
