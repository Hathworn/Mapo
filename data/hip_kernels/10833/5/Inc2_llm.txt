// Consider increasing thread block size to maximize occupancy
// Cache Ad[tx] to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Store computed values in temporary variables to minimize repeated calculations and memory access
// Optimize loop by caching values to reduce redundant memory loads inside inner loops
