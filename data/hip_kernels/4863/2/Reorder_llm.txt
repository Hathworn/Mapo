```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load histogram data into shared memory to minimize global memory usage
// Synchronize threads to ensure all histogram data is loaded before use
// Apply atomic operations on shared memory for better efficiency
// Ensure thread synchronization after updating shared memory
// Transfer updated shared memory data back to global memory efficiently
