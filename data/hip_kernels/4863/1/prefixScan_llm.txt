```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading from global to shared memory.
// Consider minimizing bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Use double-buffering to overlap computation with memory access if applicable.
// Assess the impact of warp divergence and try to minimize it.
// Use a larger block size to better utilize the GPU if shared memory allows.
