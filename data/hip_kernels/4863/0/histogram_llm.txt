```c
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize usage of shared memory for better occupancy
// Consider unrolling the loop for initializing shared histogram if block size is known
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure global memory access is aligned for better bandwidth utilization
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable to pointers for better optimization
```
