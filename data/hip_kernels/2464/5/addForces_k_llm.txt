// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory reads and writes.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for common data.
// Optimize memory alignment to improve access speed and reduce bank conflicts.
// Evaluate GPU occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance.
