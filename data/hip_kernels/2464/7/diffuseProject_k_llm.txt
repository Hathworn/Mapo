```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data within blocks to reduce global memory access.
// Merge nested loops where possible to improve data locality and instruction-level parallelism.
// Explore loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput.
// Use conditional checks to minimize divergence within warp execution.
// Evaluate reducing precision (if applicable) to decrease resource utilization and improve speed.
