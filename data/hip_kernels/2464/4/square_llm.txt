```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if the same data is used multiple times within the kernel
// Evaluate the use of multiple streams to overlap memory transfers and kernel execution
// Align data structure to meet the memory alignment requirements to increase memory access efficiency
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
