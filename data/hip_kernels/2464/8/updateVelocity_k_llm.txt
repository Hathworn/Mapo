```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for vx and vy to reduce global memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling for 'p' loop if 'lb' is known at compile time to increase performance
// Prefetch vx and vy values to registers before the 'if (fi < dy)' condition for efficiency
// Optimize pitch calculation if possible or align data to avoid misaligned memory accesses
