```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data used across multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses
// Use float2's coalesced memory access pattern to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize accesses to global memory inside the loop by storing frequently used values in registers
// Reorder computations to place memory accesses close together to improve coalescing
// Check if using texture memory could optimize read access patterns and caching behavior
