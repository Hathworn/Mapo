```cpp
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize the use of global memory through registers where possible for individual thread operations.
// Ensure memory allocation is aligned for optimal access across the compute units.
// Consider adjusting block and grid sizes for better occupancy and memory access patterns.
