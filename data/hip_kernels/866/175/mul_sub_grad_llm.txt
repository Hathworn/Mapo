// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for repeated data
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns 
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming to optimize parallelism
// Reduce memory latency by prefetching data into shared memory before computation
// Implement double buffering technique to overlap computation and data transfer
