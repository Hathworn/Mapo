// Consider using `__restrict__` keyword for pointers to optimize memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access for `d`, `m`, and `x` arrays
// Use `__syncthreads()` consistently to ensure shared memory is fully synchronized
// Align shared memory size for optimal access patterns
// Explore loop unrolling for further optimization
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives for reduction tasks
