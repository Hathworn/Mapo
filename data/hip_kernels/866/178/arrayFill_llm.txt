// Consider asynchronous data prefetching to hide memory latency
// Align data accesses to ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Optimize memory access patterns to prevent bank conflicts in global memory
// Evaluate the potential use of warp shuffle operations to minimize unnecessary memory operations
