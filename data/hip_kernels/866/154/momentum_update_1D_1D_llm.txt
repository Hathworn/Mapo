```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access.
// Try coalescing global memory accesses for better memory throughput.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced by aligning and padding data if necessary.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ keyword for pointers to potentially optimize memory access.
// Assess the potential benefits of prefetching data if memory latency is a bottleneck.
// Investigate if loop unrolling can improve performance by reducing loop control overhead.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to optimize performance and resource usage.
