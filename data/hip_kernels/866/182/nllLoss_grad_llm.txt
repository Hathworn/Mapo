```
// Consider using shared memory to cache yGrad for coalesced memory access.
// Ensure that xStride is properly aligned to improve access patterns.
// Evaluate thread block sizes to match the memory access pattern and SM occupancy.
// Minimize use of atomic operations by restructuring data or using warp shuffling.
