```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Use cooperative thread groups to efficiently handle shared memory and improve data locality
// Optimize memory access by ensuring that global memory reads are coalesced
// Align accessed memory data on proper boundaries to avoid misaligned memory access penalties
