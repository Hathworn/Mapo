// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Use constant memory for read-only data to optimize access times
// Evaluate whether using texture memory can improve performance with spatial locality
