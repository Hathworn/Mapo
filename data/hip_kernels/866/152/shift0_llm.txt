```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure all threads cooperatively load data into shared memory and synchronize correctly.
// Avoid redundant processing by checking conditions early and minimizing unnecessary computation.
// Consider adjusting block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and parallel execution.
