```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is high within blocks
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Preload data into registers for faster access
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel
// Optimize memory bandwidth by ensuring continuous data access patterns
// Evaluate the use of vectorized loads and stores if applicable
