// Consider increasing the shared memory size if necessary to accommodate more data
// Align shared memory access by ensuring shared_out_idx matches the warp size
// Employ loop unrolling to optimize the for loop and reduce instruction overhead
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for in and out arrays to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper alignment and padding
