```
// Consider using shared memory to cache in2 data for better memory access patterns
// Ensure in1 and out are accessed with coalesced memory patterns
// Increase block size for better warp utilization
// Profile memory bandwidth utilization and optimize stride as necessary
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching for improved performance
