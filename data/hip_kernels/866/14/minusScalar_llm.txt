```
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse and reduce global memory access
// Implement memory coalescing to optimize data transfer between global memory and GPU
// Explore further loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure aligned memory accesses to utilize full memory bandwidth
