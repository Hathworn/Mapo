// Use shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for increased data throughput.
// Balance the number of blocks and threads to maximize occupancy for better resource usage.
