```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for improved performance
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse patterns allow
// Optimize for occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if aliasing is not occurring with memory pointers
// Ensure alignment of data structures for vectorized access if possible
