```cpp
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store input data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance of the accumulation loop
// Align the grid and block dimensions with the hardware to maximize occupancy
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements
