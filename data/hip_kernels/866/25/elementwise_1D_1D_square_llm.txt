```
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory to store input data to reduce global memory accesses if size is large
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance by minimizing loop overhead
// Ensure memory accesses are properly aligned for optimal performance
