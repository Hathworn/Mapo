```cpp
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Evaluate if shared memory could improve performance for this kernel
// Consider unrolling the loop to enhance performance if appropriate
// Assess if reducing the grid and block size or using a different configuration improves occupancy
// Verify if any bank conflicts occur and optimize access patterns to avoid them
