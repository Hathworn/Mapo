```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for loading data into shared memory.
// Ensure that the shared memory array is sufficiently sized to handle out-of-bounds accesses.
// Evaluate if using shared memory here significantly improves performance given the access pattern.
// Consider unrolling the loop if the `size` is known and fixed at compile time.
// Assess the grid and block dimensions to optimize occupancy and resource utilization.
