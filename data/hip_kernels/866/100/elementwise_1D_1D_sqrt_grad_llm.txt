```
// Use shared memory to cache data between threads to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize divergence by avoiding warp-level branching and ensure branches are coherent across warps.
// Choose an optimal block size to maximize occupancy and balance it with register and shared memory usage.
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers for improved memory bandwidth usage.
