// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth usage
// Employ shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use loop unrolling for iterations within the kernel to enhance performance
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to better utilize GPU resources
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to reduce serialization
