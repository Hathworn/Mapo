// Use loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and improve memory throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by adjusting data alignment and access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory if applicable to further reduce global memory access latency.
// Assess block and grid size configurations for optimal utilization of GPU resources.
