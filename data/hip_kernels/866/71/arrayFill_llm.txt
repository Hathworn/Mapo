// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing for improved bandwidth utilization
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance
// Avoid potential bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to enable compiler optimizations
