// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Ensure memory is aligned to avoid misaligned access penalties
// Employ memory prefetching to minimize data fetch delay
// Explore using fast math operations for potential speedup
