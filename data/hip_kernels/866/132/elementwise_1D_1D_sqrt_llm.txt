```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by processing consecutive elements
// Utilize shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory access
// Consider using float4 for vectorized memory operations if applicable
// Align memory allocations to improve memory access speed
// Ensure grid and block sizes are optimized for maximum occupancy
