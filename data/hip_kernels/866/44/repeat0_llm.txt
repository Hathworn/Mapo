```cpp
// Use __restrict__ to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure shared memory usage to reduce global memory access latency
// Load data into shared memory to improve coalesced access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory
// Ensure each thread accesses different parts to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider tuning block size to optimize shared memory utilization and occupancy
```
