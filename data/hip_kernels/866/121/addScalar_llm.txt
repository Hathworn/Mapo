```
// Use coalesced memory access to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Ensure inputs and outputs are aligned to 128-bit boundaries.
// Minimize divergence within warp for efficient execution.
// Reduce the global memory accesses by using shared memory if applicable.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce global memory latency.
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
