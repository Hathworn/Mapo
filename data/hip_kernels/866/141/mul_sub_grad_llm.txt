```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access for in2_x
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded their part of sharedIn2X
// Implement loop unrolling to process multiple elements per iteration
// Increase stride size to maximize memory coalescing and reduce access time
