```
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers for input and output to aid compiler optimizations
// Evaluate if coalesced memory accesses can be improved by aligning data structures
// Benchmark different block and grid sizes to find the optimal configuration
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Use prefetching techniques if applicable to hide memory latency
// Ensure memory accesses are within proper bounds to avoid race conditions
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied for further instruction level parallelism
