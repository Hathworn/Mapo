```
// Use shared memory to further reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize loop unrolling factor depending on specific GPU architecture
// Evaluate if a different thread block size could improve performance
// Check if memory access patterns can benefit from L1/L2 cache usage
```
