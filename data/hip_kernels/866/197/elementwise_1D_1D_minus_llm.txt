// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.  
// Optimize the grid and block configuration to ensure coalesced memory access.  
// Implement loop unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism.  
// Use asynchronous memory copies where possible to overlap computation with data transfer.
