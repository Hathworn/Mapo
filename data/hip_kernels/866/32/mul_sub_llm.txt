```
// Consider aligning shared memory access for better performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if applicable to allow for better compiler optimizations
// Pre-fetch data into registers where possible to reduce repeated memory access
// Ensure in2ScalarCount does not exceed shared memory allocation size (256 in this case)
