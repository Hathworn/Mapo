// Consider reducing shared memory usage to avoid potential bank conflicts
// Optimize data loading to shared memory for coalesced access
// Ensure the kernel is launched with appropriate block size to maximize occupancy
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to minimize synchronization overhead
// Evaluate if loop unrolling would improve performance in the stride loop
