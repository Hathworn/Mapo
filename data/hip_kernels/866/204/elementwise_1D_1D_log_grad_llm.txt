// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Optimize data layout for better cache performance
// Increase register usage through loop unrolling
// Ensure adequate occupancy for the target GPU architecture
// Consider warp-level primitives for further optimization
