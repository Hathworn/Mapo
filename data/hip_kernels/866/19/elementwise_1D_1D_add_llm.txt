```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve data reuse within thread blocks.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifiers to assist the compiler with alias analysis and potentially improve memory load/store efficiency.
// Adjust the block size and grid size for better occupancy and ensure maximum utilization of the streaming multiprocessors.
// Explore the possibility of using memory prefetching directives or functions to hide memory access latencies.
