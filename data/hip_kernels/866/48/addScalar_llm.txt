```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations
// Use shared memory if repeated access to the same data element is needed
// Reduce global memory transactions by using vectorized data types if applicable
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Optimize for memory latency by adjusting grid and block sizes
