// Use shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data are needed
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for adjacent thread communication
// Ensure coalesced memory access by arranging data access pattern correctly
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize thread divergence
// Use constant memory for div if it remains unchanged throughout the kernel execution
