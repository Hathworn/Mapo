```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory if possible to further reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure enough threads are launched to cover the entire data size
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
// Consider using asynchronous memory transfers if applicable
