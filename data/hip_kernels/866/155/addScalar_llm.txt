```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by using sequential access patterns
// Utilize shared memory where possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Use loop unrolling to minimize control overhead and improve throughput
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and reduce warp divergence
