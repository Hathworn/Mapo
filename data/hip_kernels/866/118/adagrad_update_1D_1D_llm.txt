// Consider using shared memory for small data chunks to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to minimize bandwidth usage.
// Minimize the use of division by using reciprocal multiplication if applicable.
// Ensure that the `index` calculation avoids divergence across threads in a warp.
// Consider unrolling loops for small stride values to reduce loop overhead.
