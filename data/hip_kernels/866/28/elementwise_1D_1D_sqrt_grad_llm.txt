```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Use shared memory if possible to minimize redundant global memory access
// Consider using intrinsic functions for arithmetic operations to enhance speed
// Try to increase occupancy by optimizing block and grid dimensions
// Minimize branch divergence for consistent thread execution
