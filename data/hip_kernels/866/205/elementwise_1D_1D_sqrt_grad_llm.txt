```
// Optimize division by considering precision and performance trade-offs
// Ensure coalesced memory access for in_d, out_d, and out_x
// Consider increasing block size for better GPU utilization
// Utilize shared memory if reusing common data among threads
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize memory latency
// Explore vectorized operations to enhance throughput
