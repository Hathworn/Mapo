```
// Consider optimizing global memory access by coalescing memory reads and writes.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible.
// Ensure that atomic operations do not become a bottleneck by minimizing their usage.
// Analyze the stride calculations for opportunities to reduce computational overhead.
