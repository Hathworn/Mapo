// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure alignment of data accesses to minimize memory access overhead
// Evaluate the potential for using vectorized memory operations
// Validate if the number of threads per block is optimal for the target GPU
