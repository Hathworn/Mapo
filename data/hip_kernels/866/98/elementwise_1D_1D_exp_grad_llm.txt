```
// Consider using shared memory to store repetitive access data for improved memory access efficiency
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses to avoid warp divergence
// Apply further loop unrolling if registers and shared memory allow to maximize throughput
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to enable compiler optimizations
// Evaluate using asynchronous memory prefetching if the input size is very large
