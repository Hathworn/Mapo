// Consider using shared memory to enhance memory access patterns for data reuse.
// Transforming the for-loop to a while-loop could enhance readability and potentially reduce overhead.
// Apply compound assignment operators for reduced code complexity and enhanced understanding.
// Instead of an if condition, utilize a mask to minimize warp divergence and enhance warp efficiency.
