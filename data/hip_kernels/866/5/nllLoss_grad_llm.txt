```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data such as yGrad and target to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by accessing xGrad and target in a manner that aligns with warp boundaries.
// Consider aligning data structures to 32-byte boundaries for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Investigate if reducing the number of atomic operations through data reorganization is feasible.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to improve execution efficiency.
