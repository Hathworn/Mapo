```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Ensure data is loaded in a coalesced manner to improve memory throughput
// Minimize use of atomic operations to prevent serialization
// Consider using a hierarchical parallel reduction for the sum to enhance efficiency
// The use of loop unrolling should be considered for all inner loops to decrease control overhead
