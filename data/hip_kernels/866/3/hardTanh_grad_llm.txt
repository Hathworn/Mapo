```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Use __restrict__ keyword to improve memory access efficiency
// Align memory access to warp boundaries to improve coalescing
// Consider using half-precision floats to reduce memory bandwidth usage
// Profile the code to identify further bottlenecks and optimize accordingly
```
