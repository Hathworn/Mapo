// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data structures
// Minimize use of divergent branches within kernel loops
// Optimize loop bounds by considering execution configuration
// Use vectorized data types like float4 for improved memory bandwidth
// Evaluate different block and grid dimensions for best performance
