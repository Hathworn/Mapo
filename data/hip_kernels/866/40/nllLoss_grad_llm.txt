```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for xGrad by using a contiguous memory layout
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same yGrad values
// Consider aligning data types to improve memory alignment and access speed
// Evaluate the benefit of increasing block size to maximize occupancy
// Check for thread divergence in 'if' condition to improve performance
