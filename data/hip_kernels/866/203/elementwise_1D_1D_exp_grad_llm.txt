// Shared memory reduces global memory accesses and improves cache utilization
// Ensure data loading to shared memory is within boundaries to avoid memory access errors
// Synchronize threads after loading shared memory to ensure data consistency
// Unroll loops where appropriate to enhance execution efficiency
// Consider bank conflict issues in shared memory to avoid access delays
