```cpp
// Efficient tid calculation to minimize warp divergence
// Using shared memory to reduce global memory access; not applicable directly here, maintain simple optimization
// Use ternary operator for compact and potentially faster comparison and assignment
// Minimize operations by reducing multiple accesses
// Conditional logic optimized to minimize branch divergence
// Update x array with efficient access
// Reset d array to zero; maintain efficient writing
