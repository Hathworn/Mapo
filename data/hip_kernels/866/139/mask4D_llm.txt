// Consider using shared memory for mask values if multiple threads access the same mask[xindex0] repeatedly
// Precompute reciprocal of xstrides to reduce division operations in index calculations
// Unroll the loop to reduce branch divergence and improve performance
// Check if coalesced memory access patterns are in place for in and mask arrays
