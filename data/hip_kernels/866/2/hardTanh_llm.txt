```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to improve memory access optimization
// Use shared memory if the data is reused within the block to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth utilization
// Prefetch data into registers to hide global memory latency
// Optimize block and grid size to match the GPU architecture for optimal occupancy
