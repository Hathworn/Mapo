```
// Use coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring control flow is aligned within warps
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by choosing appropriate block and grid dimensions
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse occurs within blocks
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce global memory latency
