// Optimize: Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Optimize: Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize: Utilize warp shuffle operations if possible for intra-warp communication
// Optimize: Minimize register pressure by limiting variable scope and usage
// Optimize: Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement
