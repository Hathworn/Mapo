```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Reduce divergent branches by grouping in-bound and out-of-bound conditions
// Consider using shared memory to cache reusable min_val and max_val for faster access
// Unroll loops where applicable to maximize parallel execution
