// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance
// Consider using vectorized operations if memory alignment allows
// Optimize block size and grid size based on the target architecture for maximum efficiency
// Minimize the use of conditional statements within the kernel for better branching efficiency
