// Ensure data alignment for faster memory access
// Use shared memory if input arrays are used multiple times within the kernel
// Check for potential coalesced memory access patterns to improve throughput
// Consider prefetching data to reduce memory latency
// Profile memory bandwidth to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly
