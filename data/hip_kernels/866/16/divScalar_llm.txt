```
// Use memory coalescing for better memory access patterns
// Ensure proper alignment of data to exploit hardware capabilities
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequent data for faster access
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block and thread configurations accordingly
// Leverage compiler flags to enable further optimizations at compile time
