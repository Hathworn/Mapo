```
// Use loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and improve performance
// Optimize memory access patterns to enhance coalescing
// Ensure that each thread accesses contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enhance compiler optimizations
