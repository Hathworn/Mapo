```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using texture or read-only cache for constant memory accesses.
// Make use of warp shuffle operations to minimize thread divergence.
// Consider aligning data to optimal memory boundaries for best performance.
