```
// Ensure memory coalescing by using contiguous memory accesses
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access data to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper alignment
// Optimize occupancy by tuning block size and grid size according to the architecture
// Use __restrict__ keyword to enable compiler optimizations
