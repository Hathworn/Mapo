```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for in1_x and in1_d for better memory efficiency.
// Leverage shared memory to cache in2_x when possible, reducing global memory access.
// Ensure in2_x is read by all threads in a warp simultaneously (when accessing in2_x[index]).
// Optimize grid and block size to increase occupancy and improve memory throughput.
// Consider using stream or asynchronous memory operations for overlapping computation and data transfer.
