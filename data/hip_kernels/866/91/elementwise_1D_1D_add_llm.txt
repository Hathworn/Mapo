```
// Consider aligning data to memory boundaries to improve coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory bandwidth
// Evaluate using float4 or float2 types to increase throughput by processing multiple elements per thread
// Experiment with adjusting blockDim.x to achieve optimal performance based on hardware characteristics
