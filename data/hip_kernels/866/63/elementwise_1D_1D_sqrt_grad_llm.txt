// Consider using shared memory to cache commonly accessed data for faster access.  
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts and improve coalescing.  
// Ensure that data types are optimally aligned for vectorized accesses.  
// Minimize divergence within warp by streamlining condition checks.  
// Reduce the number of memory accesses by fetching and storing data in registers when possible.  
// Test different block and grid sizes to identify optimal configurations for memory throughput.  
// Ensure that data is accessed in contiguous memory patterns to leverage coalescing.
