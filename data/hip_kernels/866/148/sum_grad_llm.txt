```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for input and output pointers to improve compiler optimization potential.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if there are common data reused within a block.
// Apply loop unrolling for the loop iterating over elements to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning inOffset and outOffset calculations properly.
// Minimize divergent branches in switch statement by rearranging data or using template specialization.
