// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently utilized to improve occupancy.
// Load global memory into shared memory in a coalesced manner.
// Ensure all threads synchronize after loading into shared memory.
// Perform conditional checks to avoid division by zero.
