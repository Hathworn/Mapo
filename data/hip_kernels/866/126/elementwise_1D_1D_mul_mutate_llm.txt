// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider cooperative groups for efficient synchronization
// Double buffer technique for overlapping computation and data transfer
// Prefetch data to hide latency
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced access
// Minimize divergent branching for better warp efficiency
