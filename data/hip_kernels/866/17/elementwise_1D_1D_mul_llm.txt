// Consider using shared memory for caching to reduce global memory accesses
// Check if memory coalescing can be improved for increased memory throughput
// Optimize block size for maximum occupancy and performance
// Examine the use of thread divergence and minimize where possible
// Ensure data alignment to facilitate vectorized loads and stores
