```
// Consider using shared memory to cache yGrad values for better memory access patterns
// Ensure data locality by optimizing threads to process consecutive elements in memory
// Check for warp divergence and reduce conditional checks within the kernel
// Minimize memory traffic by reusing values or computations if possible
// Assess if using cooperative groups can improve synchronization and data sharing
