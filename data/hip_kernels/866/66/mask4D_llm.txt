```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease the number of branch instructions
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring that threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations
// Use register variables for frequently used indices to reduce redundant calculations
