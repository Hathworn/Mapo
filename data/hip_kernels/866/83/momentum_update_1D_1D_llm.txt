```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved global memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if possible
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal occupancy and performance
// Use loop unrolling pragmas effectively for computation-heavy loops
// Profile kernel execution to identify potential bottlenecks
// Minimize conditional statements within the loop for consistent execution paths
