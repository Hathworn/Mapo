```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if the data size fits.
// Ensure proper data alignment for improved memory transaction efficiency.
// Profile and adjust block and grid sizes for best performance based on the hardware specifics.
// Consider employing vectorized operations if the GPU architecture supports it.
