// Optimize memory access by using loop unrolling to increase efficiency
// Combine gradient clipping in a single line to reduce conditional checks
// Minimize the use of sqrtf function by storing intermediate results when possible
// Consider using shared memory if applicable to further reduce global memory access time
// Take advantage of coalesced memory access patterns to improve throughput
