// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for improved bandwidth utilization
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize the loop using vectorized operations if data alignment permits
// Reduce conditional checks where possible to increase kernel throughput
