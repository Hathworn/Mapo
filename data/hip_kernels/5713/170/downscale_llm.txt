```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory for better parallel performance
// Evaluate loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase computation speed
// Utilize __syncthreads() strategically if using shared memory to ensure data consistency across threads
