// Consider using shared memory for data that is accessed frequently.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Check if loop unrolling can further optimize parallel execution.
// Evaluate the performance impact of increasing block size for better occupancy.
// If applicable, consider using texture memory for read-only data.
