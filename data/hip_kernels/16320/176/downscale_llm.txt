// Consider using shared memory for block-level data sharing to minimize global memory accesses.
// Optimizing index calculations to decrease arithmetic overhead and potential register spilling.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning thread data access.
// Explore loop unrolling for the accumulation loops to potentially increase performance.
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to hint at non-aliasing of pointers and optimize loads.
