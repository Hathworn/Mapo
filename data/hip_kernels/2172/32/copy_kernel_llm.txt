```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing is maintained for both X and Y accesses
// Consider using shared memory if further optimization is required
// Check if loop unrolling could improve performance
// Analyze if INCX and INCY are causing non-coalesced accesses and adjust if possible
// Profile with different block and grid sizes to optimize occupancy
