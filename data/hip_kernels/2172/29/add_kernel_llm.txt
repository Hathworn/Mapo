```
// Consider aligning data accesses to improve memory coalescing.
// Utilize shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data.
// Ensure ALPHA is loaded into a register to reduce memory access overhead.
// Investigate using a larger block size to fully utilize GPU resources.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers if the data is non-overlapping.
