```
// Consider coalesced memory access by using unit stride
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Try loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations
// Check the usage of __restrict__ to optimize pointer accesses
// Implement warp-level primitives where applicable
```
