```cpp
// Ensure optimal memory access patterns by using coalesced memory reads
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads work on the same data
// Avoid branching by using intrinsic functions if possible
// Explore the potential of loop unrolling for further memory access efficiency
// Align memory allocations if possible for improved access speed
