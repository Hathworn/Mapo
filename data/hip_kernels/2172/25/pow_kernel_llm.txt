// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning INCX and INCY
// Investigate if using texture memory could benefit read-only X array accesses
// Use loop unrolling if the loop iteration count is predictable and small
// Optimize block size and grid size based on the target GPU architecture
// Prefer using __powf for potential faster computations on some architectures
