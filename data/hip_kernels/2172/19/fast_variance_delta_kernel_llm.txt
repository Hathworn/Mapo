// Consider using shared memory or cache to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize thread-block size for better occupancy and throughput.
// Apply loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure memory coalescing to maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Use pinned memory for faster data transfer between host and device.
