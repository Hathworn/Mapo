```
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing accesses to global memory
// Preload data into shared memory if further calculations are needed
// Minimize the number of arithmetic operations inside the kernel
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy
// Align memory access to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider using the __restrict__ keyword to optimize pointer aliasing
