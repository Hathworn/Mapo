```
// Use coalesced memory access for 'output' to increase memory efficiency
// Load 'biases[j]' into a register outside the loop to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize warp occupancy
// Consider using shared memory if biases are reused frequently to minimize global memory traffic
// Minimize divergence in the loop by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same code path
