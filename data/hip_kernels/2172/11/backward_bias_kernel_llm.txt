```
// Consider vectorizing memory accesses for delta array if possible
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for delta array
// Optimize reduction by minimizing thread divergence within a warp
// Check for optimal block size (BLOCK) based on the architecture
// Investigate potential benefits of loop unrolling further for batch and size loops
// Evaluate if memory coalescing can be improved for delta array access
// Explore using atomic operations for updating bias_updates to avoid race conditions
