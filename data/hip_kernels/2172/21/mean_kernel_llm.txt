// Ensure data alignment for better memory access.
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access.
// Prefetch data to reduce latency during memory access.
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores to enhance memory throughput.
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy.
