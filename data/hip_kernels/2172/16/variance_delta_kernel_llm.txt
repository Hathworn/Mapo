// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Ensure proper memory coalescing to optimize memory access patterns
// Precompute constants outside of nested loops to reduce computation redundancy
// Use registers for intermediate sums to speed up calculations
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by computing results within the kernel before writing back
