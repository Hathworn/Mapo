```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for pred and truth arrays
// Align memory allocations to optimize global memory access
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory transactions
// Consider vectorized operations to enhance memory throughput
// Prioritize the use of fast math operations for computational efficiency
// Minimize branch divergence within warp by restructuring code logic
