```
// Use shared memory to cache out_delta values for each block to reduce global memory access.
// Consider vectorized loads of out_delta using float4 for better memory coalescing.
// Optimize memory access pattern by ensuring alignment and minimizing bank conflicts.
// Use warp shuffling methods to share delta_part among threads to avoid redundant calculations.
