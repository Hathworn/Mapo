```
// Consider using faster atomic operations if applicable to reduce threads waiting time.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Preload data in shared memory to decrease global memory latency.
// Reduce the number of synchronizations within the shared memory block.
// Ensure efficient computation to keep all threads in a warp busy.
