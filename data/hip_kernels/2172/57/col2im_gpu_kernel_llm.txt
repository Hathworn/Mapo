```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to cache data_col for reused access within the block.
// Ensure calculations of indices are minimized within the loop.
// Evaluate the benefits of using __ldg for read-only memory accesses.
// Suggest reducing usage of registers by limiting variable scope.
// Consider adjusting grid and block size for improved occupancy and utilization.
// Assess potential benefits of using half-precision (FP16) if precision requirements allow.
// Leverage warp shuffle functions for intra-warp communication if applicable.
