```
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy and ensure efficient utilization of shared memory
// Use coalesced memory access for 'pred' and 'truth' arrays to improve global memory throughput
// Minimize synchronization points by restructuring computations where possible
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits for larger datasets
// Avoid branch divergence in conditional statements for better warp execution efficiency
