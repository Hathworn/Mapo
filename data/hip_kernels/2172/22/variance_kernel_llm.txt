```
// Move scale calculation outside of kernel for better reuse.
// Calculate global index once to reduce redundant operations.
// Use a condition to exit the kernel early when out of bounds.
// Reduce repetitive float multiplication by precalculating scale.
// Use shared memory or registers to hold intermediate results.
// Replace powf operation with simpler arithmetic to improve performance.
// Consider loop unrolling or using vectorized loads for memory access.
