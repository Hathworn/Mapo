```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to increase memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to cache data and minimize global memory access where beneficial
// Ensure optimal block and grid size to maximize occupancy and improve performance
// Avoid redundant recalculations of indices to further optimize arithmetic operations
// Use aligned memory access patterns to avoid memory bank conflicts
