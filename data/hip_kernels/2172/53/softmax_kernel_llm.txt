```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for the computation.
// Check for alignment of input and output pointers for coalesced access.
// Use smaller data types if precision allows to improve memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate if memory access patterns can be optimized for cache efficiency.
// Assess whether loop unrolling could provide a performance benefit.
// Verify if using constant memory for certain parameters could be beneficial.
// Minimize the use of global memory accesses where possible in favor of shared memory.
