// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning conditional statements.
// Evaluate the use of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions efficiently.
