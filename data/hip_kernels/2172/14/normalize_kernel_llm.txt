```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads from global memory
// Use shared memory to store mean and variance if they are reused across multiple threads
// Consider padding to ensure coalesced access patterns
// Minimize divergence by reducing conditional statements inside the kernel
// Ensure continuous memory access within each warp for better performance
