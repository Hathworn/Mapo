```
// Improve memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access to global memory.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data shared across threads.
// Minimize memory latency by maximizing the use of shared memory.
// Optimize loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Apply loop tiling techniques to reduce cache misses.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to decrease synchronization overhead.
