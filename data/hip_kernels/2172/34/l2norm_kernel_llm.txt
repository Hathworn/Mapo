// Consider reducing shared memory usage by optimizing index calculations.
// Use of atomic operations in shared memory can be expensive; explore alternatives.
// Ensure that memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance.
// Investigate using warp shuffle techniques for sum reduction instead of atomic adds.
// Optimize block and thread configuration for better occupancy and to minimize idle threads.
