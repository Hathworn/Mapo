// Use loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead in the spatial loop.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to optimize bandwidth.
// Use shared memory efficiently by reducing bank conflicts.
// Apply warp-level reduction to optimize final reduction steps.
// Minimize __syncthreads usage by leveraging warp shuffle instructions for reduction.
