```
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by setting INCX to 1 if possible
// Consider using shared memory if ALPHA is computed in the kernel to reduce global memory reads
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to optimize occupancy and performance
// Align memory allocations to improve memory access speed
