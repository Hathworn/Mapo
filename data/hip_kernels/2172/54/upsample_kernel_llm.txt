```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use texture memory for read-only data that are accessed multiple times by all threads in a warp.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures and processing.
// Precompute as many values as possible outside the kernel to reduce redundant computation.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring the conditional logic where possible.
// Optimize stride usage by evaluating the necessity of stride-related calculations.
