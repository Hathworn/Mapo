```
// Use grid-stride loop to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning INCX with warp size
// Consider using shared memory if ALPHA is reused frequently
// Minimize register usage to avoid register spilling
// Tune block size and grid size based on the target GPU architecture
