```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if 'n' is small enough.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Ensure 'blockDim.x' is a multiple of the warp size to improve performance.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all conditional structures are warp-wide.
// Adjust the grid and block size to ensure the kernel is fully utilized.
