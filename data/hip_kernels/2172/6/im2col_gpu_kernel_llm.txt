```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data_im for blocks to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use coalesced access patterns for reading from data_im to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Ensure data_col writes are coalesced to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Evaluate the impact of using float4 for vectorized memory access if applicable.
