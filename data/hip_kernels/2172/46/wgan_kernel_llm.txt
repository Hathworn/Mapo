```
// Increase the size of shared memory to improve parallel data access efficiency.
// Align the shared memory access pattern with coalesced memory access for pred and truth.
// Consider looping to handle cases where n exceeds the size of shared memory.
// Optimize the syncthreads usage to reduce unnecessary synchronization and potential warp divergence.
// Use vectorized memory operations for pred and truth to improve memory throughput.
