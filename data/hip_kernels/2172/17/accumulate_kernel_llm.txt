```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns in global memory
// Experiment with unrolling the loop to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Evaluate the use of atomics if accumulation involves complex operations
