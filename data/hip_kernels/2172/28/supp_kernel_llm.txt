```c
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Evaluate using a larger block size for increased parallelism
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring warp synchronous execution
// Use prefetching to overlap computation and data transfer
```
