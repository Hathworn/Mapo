```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for best performance
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within block is needed
// Optimize thread divergence by aligning memory accesses
// Experiment with different block sizes for maximum occupancy
// Minimize unnecessary computation in conditional assignments
