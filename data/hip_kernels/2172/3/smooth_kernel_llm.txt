// Flatten block and thread IDs into a single ID to ensure coalesced memory access
// Precalculate half of size to avoid redundant computation
// Pre-calculate output index to reduce repeated calculations within the loop
// Consider using shared memory for accessing x within boundary checks to reduce global memory access
// Ensure boundary check reduces divergent branching, optimizing the loop control flow
// Use atomic operations on delta[out_index] if necessary to prevent race conditions
