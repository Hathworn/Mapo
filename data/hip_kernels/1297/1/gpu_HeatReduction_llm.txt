```
// Consider using float4 or float2 to coalesce memory loads and improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use __ldg() function in architectures where applicable for read-only data to leverage cache benefits.
// Ensure the data alignment is appropriate to take advantage of vectorized memory operations.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for the hardware.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory and ensure the memory access pattern maximizes throughput.
// Consider using __half2, if CUDA Cores and memory throughput support, to double the operations per cycle.
