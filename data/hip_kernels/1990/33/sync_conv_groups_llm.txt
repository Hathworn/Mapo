// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize block and thread layout to match data access patterns.
// Align data accesses to improve memory coalescing.
// Minimize divergence within warp for better execution efficiency.
// Reduce number of synchronization barriers if possible.
