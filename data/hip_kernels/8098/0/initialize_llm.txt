```
// Use shared memory if reusing data across threads
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access with memory boundaries
// Minimize global memory access by fetching data into registers when possible
// Avoid warp divergence by reducing conditional branching
// Optimize block size for GPU occupancy and memory bandwidth
