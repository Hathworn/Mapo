```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for d_in and d_out to improve memory access speed.
// Explore using shared memory if operations involve data reuse within a block.
// Check if memory access pattern can benefit from coalescing.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to improve cache performance.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques for the cube calculation if possible.
// Confirm alignment of memory allocations for d_in and d_out if not already done.
