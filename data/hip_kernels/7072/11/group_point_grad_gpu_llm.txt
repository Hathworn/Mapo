```c
// Use shared memory to cache idx and grad_out for reduced global memory access.
// Coalesce global memory access to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Check for potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives for better synchronization and efficiency.
