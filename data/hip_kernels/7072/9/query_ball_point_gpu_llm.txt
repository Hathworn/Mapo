```cpp
// Coalesce memory accesses by organizing xyz1 and xyz2 in Structure of Arrays (SoA) format
// Use shared memory to cache xyz1 data within a block to reduce global memory loads
// Adjust block size to ensure optimal occupancy and maximize warp utilization
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for xyz1, xyz2, idx, and pts_cnt pointers
// Pre-compute and reuse distance calculations to minimize redundant operations
// Experiment with different data layouts for idx to improve cache efficiency
