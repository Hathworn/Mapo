```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory read efficiency
// Leverage shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access if feasible
// Evaluate if restructuring loops could improve data locality and cache usage
// Assess using float4/float2 for loading/storing vectors to enhance throughput
