```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for xyz if multiple threads within a block work on the same batch
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for xyz and idx_out to improve throughput
// Ensure temp_dist and idx_out updates minimize divergent branching
// Use float3 for xyz coordinates to leverage vectorized memory access if applicable
// Evaluate the use of warp-synchronous programming for shared calculations
// Pre-fetch data to registers to reduce latency where possible
