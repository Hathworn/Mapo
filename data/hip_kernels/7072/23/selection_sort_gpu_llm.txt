// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory access patterns
// Ensure that shared memory reads and writes are coalesced
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider utilizing warp shuffle functions for efficient data exchange
// Explore loop unrolling in critical loops to enhance performance
