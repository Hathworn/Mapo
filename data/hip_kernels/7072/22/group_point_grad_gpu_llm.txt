```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for grad_out by having threads access consecutive locations
// Optimize idx memory access while ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Ensure grad_points memory writes are coalesced as much as possible
// Utilize shared memory to speed up repetitive reads when accessing idx and grad_out
// Reduce the use of atomic operations to minimize contention and improve performance
