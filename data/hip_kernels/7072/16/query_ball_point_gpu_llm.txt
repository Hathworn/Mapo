```
// Use squared distance to avoid sqrt computation for performance improvement
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for xyz1 and xyz2 to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize idx writes by using shared memory if possible to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure block and thread dimensions are optimal for maximizing GPU utilization
