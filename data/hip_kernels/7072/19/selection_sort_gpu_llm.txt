```
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for dist and out to improve global memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store current thread block data temporarily during sorting to minimize global memory access
// Ensure all data used frequently is stored in registers to reduce redundant access to global memory
// Optimize by reducing branch divergence within warp, especially in the find min operation
