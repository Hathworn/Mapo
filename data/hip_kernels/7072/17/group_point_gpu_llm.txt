```
// Consider increasing the shared memory size if nsample exceeds 256 to avoid fallback to global memory.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning shared memory loads and accesses properly.
// Reduce memory divergence by ensuring threads within a warp take similar execution paths.
// Align out array access to facilitate better caching and reduce memory latency.
