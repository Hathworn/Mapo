```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize shared memory usage where possible to save resources
// Consider using warp-level primitives for parallel reductions within a warp
// Explore potential for using __ldg()/__stg() for read-only data for better cache utilization
// Profile memory access patterns to identify any potential bottlenecks or uncoalesced access
// Ensure the inner loop of selection sort is optimized for memory access patterns
