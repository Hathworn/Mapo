```c
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads from xyz1 and xyz2.
// Use shared memory to store xyz2 data for reuse among threads.
// Avoid branching within the for loop to reduce warp divergence.
// Precompute squares of xyz2 coordinates to reduce redundant calculations.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance.
// Utilize texture memory if data in xyz1 or xyz2 is read-only and exhibits spatial locality.
