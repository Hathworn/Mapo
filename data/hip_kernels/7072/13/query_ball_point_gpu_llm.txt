```
// Consider using shared memory for data accessed by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses
// Align memory access patterns through coalesced memory accesses for both xyz1 and xyz2
// Reduce the use of sqrtf function by comparing squared values instead of actual distance
// Ensure data preloading into shared memory for iterative processing within a block
// Use float4 types for xyz coordinate loading to optimize memory transactions
// Parallelize the initialization loop for indices to improve performance
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional logic, if possible
