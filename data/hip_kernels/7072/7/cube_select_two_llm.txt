```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing.
// Load xyz data into shared memory within each block to speed up access times.
// Ensure synchronization after loading data into shared memory to prevent race conditions.
// Unroll inner loops to reduce loop overhead and enable more efficient pipeline execution.
// Consider optimizing the indexing logic and memory access patterns for better memory access efficiency.
