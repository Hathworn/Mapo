// Use shared memory to store normalization factors for coalesced memory access
// Prefetch normalization data to reduce stalls and increase throughput
// Consider using half precision floats if precision requirements allow
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring conditional statements efficiently
// Ensure memory alignment for float accesses to improve performance
