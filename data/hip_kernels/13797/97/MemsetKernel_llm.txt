```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing global memory in sequential order
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access similar data
// Consider increasing block size to improve occupancy
// Ensure proper memory alignment for optimal global memory access
// Minimize thread divergence by managing control structures carefully
