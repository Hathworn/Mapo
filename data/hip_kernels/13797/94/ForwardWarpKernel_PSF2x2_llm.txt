```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for better memory coalescing
// Group memory accesses to reduce number of global memory reads
// Utilize __restrict__ pointers to help compiler optimize memory access
// Use __ldg() to leverage texture cache for read-only data if applicable
// Minimize atomic operations by accumulating contributions in registers first
// Explore using float4 instead of float for vectorized memory operations
