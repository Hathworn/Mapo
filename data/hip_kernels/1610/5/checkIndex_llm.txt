// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure data is accessed in a contiguous manner for better cache performance
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts for more efficient access patterns
// Assess the possibility of loop unrolling for performance gains
// Evaluate the use of registers to keep frequently accessed data
// Utilize warp-level primitives for collective operations
// Employ thread blocking techniques to enhance resource utilization  
// Adjust occupancy by fine-tuning thread and block dimensions
