```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for better global memory throughput
// Ensure proper alignment of arrays A, B, C to avoid unaligned accesses
// Consider shared memory if further speedup is needed by reducing global memory traffic
// Avoid bank conflicts if shared memory is used in further optimizations
// Try using asynchronous memory operations for overlapping data transfer and computation
