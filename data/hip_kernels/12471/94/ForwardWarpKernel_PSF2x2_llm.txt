```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results if possible
// Minimize the usage of _atomicAdd as they can serialize operations
// Check if loop unrolling can reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure threads access memory in a contiguous manner to use memory efficiently
