```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory with threads in the same warp
// Minimize divergence by reducing conditional branches inside the kernel
// Avoid warp divergence by processing data in a structured manner to ensure all threads in a warp follow the same path
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage if data reuse is high
// Use warp shuffle operations for better synchronization and data reuse instead of explicit shared memory when appropriate
