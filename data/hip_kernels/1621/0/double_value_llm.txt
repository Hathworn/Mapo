// Consider using shared memory for repetitive access patterns.
// Ensure data access is coalesced for optimal performance.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization to reduce overhead.
// Opt for streams to overlap data transfer and computation.
// Adjust block and grid sizes for better occupancy and performance.
