```
// Ensure the thread id calculation does not perform redundant computation by pre-calculating values.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables if applicable.
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for small and predictable 'count' values.
// Use pointer arithmetic for efficient inline calculations and array accesses.
// Minimize divergent code paths within the loop for better warp execution efficiency.
// Consider warp-level operations if 'count' values vary minimally across threads.
