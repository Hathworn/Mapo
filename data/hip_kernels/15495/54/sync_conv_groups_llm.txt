// Consider using shared memory to improve access speed for frequently accessed data
// Ensure data alignment to maximize memory coalescing
// Use warp shuffle operations for efficient intra-warp communication
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance
