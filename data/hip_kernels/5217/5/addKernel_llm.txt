// Consider using shared memory if data reuse exists to reduce global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to minimize memory latency
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring all threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory when implementing optimizations
// Check for thread divergence and avoid unnecessary calculations
