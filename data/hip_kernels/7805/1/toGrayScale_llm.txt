// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads for input data.
// Use shared memory if data reuse between threads is possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for pixel processing to streamline operations and reduce overhead.
// Evaluate the usage of constant memory for fixed weight values (0.114f, 0.587f, 0.299f) to reduce register pressure.
