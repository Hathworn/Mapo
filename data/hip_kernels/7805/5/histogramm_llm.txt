```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning input data according to warp size
// Ensure shared memory initialization is performed efficiently for all threads
// Use stride optimally to maximize memory access efficiency
// Minimize atomic operations to reduce contention in shared memory
// Optimize loop unrolling based on balance between occupancy and register pressure
// Ensure correct synchronization to prevent data hazards
```
