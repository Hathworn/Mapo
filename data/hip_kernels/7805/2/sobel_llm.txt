// Consider further optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses to shared memory.  
// Allocate shared memory statically before launching the kernel, to reduce overhead during execution.
// Use texture memory or read-only cache for constant weights to take advantage of spatial locality.  
// Implement memory padding or alignment if necessary to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.  
// Profile different block and grid settings to find the optimal configuration for memory throughput.
