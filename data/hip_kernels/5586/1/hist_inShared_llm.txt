```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for global memory loads and stores
// Consider increasing shared memory size for better performance
// Minimize atomic operations to reduce contention and increase throughput
// Ensure alignment in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Explore loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
