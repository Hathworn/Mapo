// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory before proceeding with calculations
// Leverage atomic operations in shared memory to improve performance
// Ensure threads cooperate using synchronization before accessing shared memory
// Transfer computed results from shared to global memory efficiently
