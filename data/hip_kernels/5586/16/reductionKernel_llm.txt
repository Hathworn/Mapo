```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Synchronize threads after loading from global memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all additions are complete before next operation
// Store intermediate reduction results in global memory
// Final reduction is done by thread 0 of block 0
```
