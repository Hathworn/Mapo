```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning accesses for global memory
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Explore using compiler directives to optimize loop unrolling
// Investigate memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts
// Leverage asynchronous memory copy if applicable for overlapping computation with data transfer
```
