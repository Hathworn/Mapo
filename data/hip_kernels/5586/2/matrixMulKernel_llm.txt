```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure tiles fit into shared memory by correctly sizing them
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Keep the loop unrolled where possible for loop efficiency
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Optimize the number of tiles to minimize thread divergence
