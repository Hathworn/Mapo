```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning loop conditions and avoiding unnecessary branches.
// Reduce synchronization overhead by optimizing synchronization points.
// Consider potential bank conflicts in shared memory access and look for ways to mitigate them.
