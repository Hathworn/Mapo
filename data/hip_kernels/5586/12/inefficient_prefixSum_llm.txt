```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive data
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by optimizing shared memory usage
// Ensure that each thread has enough work to justify its creation and avoid underutilization
