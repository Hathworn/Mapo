```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to aid compiler optimizations
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
// Ensure shared memory usage fits within hardware constraints
// Consider using streams to overlap computation and memory transfers
