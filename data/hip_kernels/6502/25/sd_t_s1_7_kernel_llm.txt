```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for shared memory loads
// Minimize global memory access by reusing data in shared memory
// Consider using read-only data cache where applicable
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by proper indexing
// Ensure enough threads are utilized for shared memory efficiency
// Examine if loop unrolling can further improve performance
// Use vectorized loads and stores where possible
