```c
// Use shared memory to cache inputs like t2_d to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement coalesced global memory access pattern for v2_d to improve throughput
// Use grid-stride loop to enhance parallel execution 
// Optimize loop order for better memory access pattern and cache utilization
// Synchronize threads after loading shared memory to ensure all threads have consistent data
```
