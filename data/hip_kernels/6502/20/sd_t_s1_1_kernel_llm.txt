```
// Consider memory coalescing by aligning shared memory loads with consecutive threads to reduce bank conflicts.
// Utilize shared memory more effectively by loading from global memory into shared memory in a warp fashion.
// Evaluate replacing atomic operations with warp-level primitives for better performance.
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring reads and writes adhere to alignment preferences.
