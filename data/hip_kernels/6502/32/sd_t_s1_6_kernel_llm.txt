```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for t2_d when loading into shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads finish loading shared memory before proceeding
// Optimize memory access patterns in t3d to reduce global memory traffic
// Update thread block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize latency
// Consider the use of additional shared memory to store frequently accessed data for v2_d, if applicable
// Assess if loop unrolling could benefit the innermost loops for higher performance
// Investigate if using texture memory can improve access latency for read-only data
