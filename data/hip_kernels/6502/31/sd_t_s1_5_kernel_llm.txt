// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for t2_d to improve bandwidth utilization
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() only where necessary to reduce synchronization overhead
// Investigate the benefit of loop unrolling within the main computation loop to reduce loop control overhead
// Evaluate performance impact of increasing block size for better occupancy and reduced kernel launch overhead
