```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential thread memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading t2_d into shared memory
// Consider unrolling loops to improve instruction throughput and reduce loop overhead
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to increase efficiency
// Consolidate memory accesses to increase the utilization of memory bandwidth
