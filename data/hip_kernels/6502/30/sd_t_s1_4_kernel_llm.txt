```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory to ensure all threads are using the same data
// Calculate offset for global memory indices once to minimize redundant computation
// Use stride to ensure each thread is responsible for multiple computations, maximizing thread utilization
// Reduce memory access by computing shared memory and global memory offsets once and reusing them in loops
