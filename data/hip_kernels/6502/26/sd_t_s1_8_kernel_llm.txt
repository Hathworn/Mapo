```
// Ensure coalesced access pattern for global memory reads from t2_d and v2_d arrays.
// Use proper alignment of shared memory (t2_shm) to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider increasing the size of shared memory (t2_shm) if occupancy allows.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data on supported hardware for better cache utilization.
// Evaluate the use of register blocking for the innermost loop with largest computational reuse.
// Avoid redundant computation by pre-computing repeated expressions.
