```
// Improve memory coalescing when loading data into shared memory
// Optimize shared memory usage for better thread block efficiency
// Use vectorized loads to optimize memory access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Minimize use of atomic operations if possible
// Evaluate using double buffering for overlapping computation and data transfer
