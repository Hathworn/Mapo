```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory 
// Avoid unnecessary computations or memory accesses outside the if block to improve thread efficiency
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
