```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to g_hash to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results within a block to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data structures to avoid misaligned accesses that could lower performance
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same instructions
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the configuration that maximizes occupancy and performance
