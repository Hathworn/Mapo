```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize the thread block size for better occupancy
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to improve computation efficiency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Profile the kernel to find bottlenecks and optimize them
```
