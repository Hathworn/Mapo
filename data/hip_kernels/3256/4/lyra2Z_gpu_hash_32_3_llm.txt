```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory writes to g_hash for better memory throughput.
// Minimize global memory access by keeping temporary results in registers.
// Profile and adjust block and grid sizes to enhance occupancy and performance.
// Explore using __restrict__ keyword to provide the compiler with optimization hints.
