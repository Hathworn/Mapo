// Use shared memory for indexes and delta to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize memory divergence by optimizing access patterns within the unrolled loops.
// Use texture or surface memory for read-only data to optimize bandwidth.
