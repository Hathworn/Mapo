```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to a, b, and c arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure a, b, c arrays are suitably aligned to facilitate coalesced memory accesses.
// Evaluate using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data in the kernel.
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers.
// Assess loop unrolling techniques if the kernel contains loops to optimize execution speed.
