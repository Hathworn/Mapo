```cpp
// Use thread_stride and loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads of delta and x_norm
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads before reduction
// Minimize contention using atomicAdd only when necessary
```
