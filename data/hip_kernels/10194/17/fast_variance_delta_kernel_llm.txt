// Consider using shared memory effectively to store large arrays
// Use thread synchronization wisely to ensure complete data handling
// Optimize memory access patterns by calculating strides
// Unroll loops to improve warp utilization and reduce branching
// Employ shared memory reduction techniques to minimize global memory access
