// Consider using shared memory for caching X and Y to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure that data accessed by each thread is coalesced to achieve optimal memory throughput
// Evaluate using __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers X and Y to help the compiler with optimizations
// Assess potential benefits of loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in the kernel
