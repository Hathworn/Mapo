```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for global memory reads and writes.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce the overhead of loop control.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for your specific hardware for maximum occupancy.
// If possible, use texture memory for read-only data to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure kernel launches are asynchronous to overlap with data transfers if possible.
