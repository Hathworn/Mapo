// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring input and rand arrays are memory aligned
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed values to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Optimize loop unrolling to increase instructions per cycle
// Evaluate warp-based intrinsic functions for faster conditional evaluations
