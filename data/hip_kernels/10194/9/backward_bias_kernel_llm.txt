// Unroll the loop to improve memory access patterns
// Use a parallel reduction to accumulate partial sums
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to increase memory throughput
// Minimize use of atomic operations to reduce contention
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to optimize data movement from global memory
