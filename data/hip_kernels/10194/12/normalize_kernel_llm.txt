// Use shared memory to store mean and variance for fast access and reduced global memory reads.
// Consider loop unrolling in the normalization calculation to reduce instruction overhead.
// Ensure warp synchronization with __syncthreads() when using shared memory to avoid race conditions.
// Minimize register usage by simplifying index calculations where possible.
