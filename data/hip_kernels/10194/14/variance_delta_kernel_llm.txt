```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like variance[i]
// Unroll loop iterations to improve performance
// Use float2 or float4 to load/store multiple elements at once
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for global memory
// Reduce redundant calculations by storing common expressions in variables
