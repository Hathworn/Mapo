```
// Consider reducing global memory accesses by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Ensure memory coalescing by having adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations
// Minimize the usage of division/modulus operations within loops as they are computationally expensive
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize latency from accessing global memory
// Implement loop unrolling to decrease loop control overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Explore the use of warp shuffle functions to reduce memory traffic for intra-warp communication
// Align data structures to the memory boundary to enhance cache performance and reduce bank conflicts
