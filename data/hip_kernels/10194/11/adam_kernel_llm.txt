// Avoid redundant computation of "sqrtf(v_val) + eps" by using registers  
// Perform memory coalescing for better global memory access pattern  
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed values like "m[index]" and "v[index]"  
// Use loop unrolling for processing multiple indices in a single thread  
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize warp utilization
