```cpp
// Use shared memory to load input data for coalesced access.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance.
// Optimize to maximize occupancy by balancing register and shared memory usage.
// Reduce memory transactions by combining multiple loads into vectorized operations.
// Explore asynchronous loads if supported and beneficial for this kernel architecture.
