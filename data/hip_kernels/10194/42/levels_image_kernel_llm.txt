```
// Ensure memory coalescing by arranging data accessed by consecutive threads close in memory.
// Reduce unnecessary memory accesses and ensure data reuse.
// Consider using shared memory for data accessed multiple times by threads within a block.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and resource utilization.
// Utilize warp-level primitives where applicable to minimize register pressure and latency.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring unique access patterns.
// Minimize branching by restructuring conditionals and loop constructs.
