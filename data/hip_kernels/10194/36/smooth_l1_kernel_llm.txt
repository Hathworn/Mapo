// Consider using shared memory if data reuse can benefit threads within a block
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Exploit data locality by loading data into registers when possible
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to suggest no aliasing for the compiler
