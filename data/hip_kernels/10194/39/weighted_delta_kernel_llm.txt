```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data and accessing memory sequentially
// Utilize shared memory if reuse of certain data is significant, especially for large arrays
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop body involves complex calculations to improve instruction level parallelism
// Optimize register usage to reduce register pressure and maintain efficient use of GPU resources
// Assess if memory access patterns can benefit from using texture or constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data
// Experiment with adjusting block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and efficiency
