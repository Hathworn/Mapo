```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring INCX and INCY are set to 1.
// Align memory accesses to improve cache utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory reads where applicable.
// Optimize block size and grid size to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient use of resources.
// Consider loop unrolling for the stride loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure memory allocated for X and Y is aligned for improved memory access performance.
