```c
// Ensure data is coalesced by accessing global memory in a strided manner
// Use caching features like __ldg() for frequently accessed data if available
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within the block can be achieved
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
// Evaluate use of float4 if data alignment and access patterns allow for vectorized loads
```
