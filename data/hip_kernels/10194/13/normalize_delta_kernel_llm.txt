```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes for better cache utilization.
// Consider using shared memory for cache-reused terms to minimize register usage.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to fully utilize GPU resources.
// Potentially fuse this kernel with other operations to reduce the kernel launch overhead.
// Analyze the use of atomic operations if needed when updating shared resources.
