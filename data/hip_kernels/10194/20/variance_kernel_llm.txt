```c
// Precompute scale to reduce redundant calculations
// Flatten grid and block indices for better 1D memory access
// Use early exit to minimize unnecessary computations
// Initialize local variables to reduce memory writes
// Use loop unrolling to optimize performance and reduce overhead
// Calculate linear index to maximize memory access efficiency
