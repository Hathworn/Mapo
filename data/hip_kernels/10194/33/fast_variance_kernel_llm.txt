// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to enhance performance.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Verify the stride logic is correctly implemented for potential re-use in memory access.
// Double-check the use of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
