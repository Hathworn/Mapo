```
// Consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization to reduce overhead
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory reads
// Use double buffering technique to overlap memory loads and computation
// Minimize the use of atomic operations when possible or use atomic functions that provide better performance
// Tune the block size and grid size for better occupancy and hardware utilization
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed the limit to avoid bank conflicts
