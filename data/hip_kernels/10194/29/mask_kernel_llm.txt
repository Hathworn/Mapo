```c
// Consider using shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses.
// Check if "mask" can be stored in shared memory for faster access.
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency.
// Ensure that all access to global memory is necessary and unavoidable.
// Strive for occupancy by ensuring the grid size and block size are optimal.
