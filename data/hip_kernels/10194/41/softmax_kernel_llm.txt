// Consider using shared memory to reduce memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning input and output arrays
// Use warp-based reduction for optimal performance in finding the largest value
// Minimize register utilization by reordering computations within softmax_device
// Prefetch data to reduce access time during calculations
// Experiment with accessing input and output using texture memory for better caching
