```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory loads when calculating means
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory addresses
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory to hide memory latency
// Ensure use of __syncthreads() after updating shared memory to maintain consistency
// Utilize warp shuffle operations to optimize the reduction step without synchronization
// Reduce divergent branches by utilizing a conditional move instead of if-else statements
