```
// Calculate scale outside of the kernel for efficient reuse
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous access patterns
// Consider unrolling loops for better performance
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately to synchronize shared memory usage
// Compute block sums in a separate loop to avoid thread divergence
