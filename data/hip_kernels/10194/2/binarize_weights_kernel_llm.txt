```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Load entire block of weights into shared memory to minimize global memory transactions
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Compute mean once in shared memory to avoid redundant calculations
// Use shared memory to efficiently set and store binary weights
```
