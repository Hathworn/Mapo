// Utilize shared memory to aggregate results across multiple threads efficiently.
// Ensure all threads synchronize before the reduction step to prevent race conditions.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced global memory access.
// Accumulate results in thread 0 using shared memory to reduce global memory writes.
