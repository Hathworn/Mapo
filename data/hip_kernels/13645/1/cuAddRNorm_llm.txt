// Optimize memory access by ensuring all threads in a block participate in vector loading
// Consider using half2 for vector loading and computation for reducing memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure warp-level parallelism is maximized by adjusting block and thread dimensions appropriately
// Utilize __ldg to leverage read-only cache for accessing input vector elements when appropriate
