```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory throughput where possible.
// Reduce redundant computations by caching repeated values or expressions.
// Optimize loop unrolling for small loop bodies to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Minimize warp divergence within conditional branches for better performance.
// Adjust block and grid sizes based on hardware capabilities to maximize occupancy.
