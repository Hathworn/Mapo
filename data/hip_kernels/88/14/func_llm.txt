```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory bandwidth
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to meet architectural requirements
// Evaluate use of asynchronous memory copies to potentially hide latency
// Assess if loop unrolling could benefit the kernel performance
