```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimized performance
// Minimize memory transfers between host and device
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure proper thread block size for maximum occupancy
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for computation segments
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory usage
