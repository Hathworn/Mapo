// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize the number of unnecessary computations within loops
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for improved bandwidth utilization
// Consider using vectorized operations for memory access in future optimizations
