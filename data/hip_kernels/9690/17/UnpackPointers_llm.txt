// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate if using warp shuffle operations can replace some data exchange to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize divergent branches as much as possible to improve warp execution efficiency.
