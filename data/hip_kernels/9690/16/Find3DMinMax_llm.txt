```
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance
// Minimize the use of conditional statements inside the loop for better efficiency
// Use vectorized operations if possible to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure thread synchronization is used appropriately to avoid data races
