// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Load data conditionally, reducing load/store divergence.
// Utilize max and min functions to handle boundary conditions effectively.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data before proceeding.
// Unroll the loop to improve performance by reducing the loop overhead.
// Compute results conditionally to avoid unnecessary calculations.
// Write results back to global memory efficiently only when conditions are met.
