```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to potentially improve memory access optimization
// Align shared memory access to improve memory coalescing
// Optimize shared memory allocation to reduce bank conflicts
// Use texture memory (if beneficial) to exploit hardware caching
// Minimize global memory access by maximizing data use in shared memory
// Explore loop unrolling in critical loops for performance improvement
