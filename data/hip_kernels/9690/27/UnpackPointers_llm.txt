```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory access for 'minmax' to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access for 'minmax'
// Prefetch 'minmax' data into shared memory to minimize latency
// Ensure 'ptrs' writes are coalesced for better memory performance
// Limit divergence in the if block to maintain warp efficiency
