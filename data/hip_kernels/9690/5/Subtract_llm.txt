```
// Consider using __restrict__ to potentially enable compiler optimizations
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance
// Collaboratively load data among threads to utilize shared memory efficiently
// Align data pointers to improve memory access speed
