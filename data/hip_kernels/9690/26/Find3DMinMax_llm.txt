```c
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth.
// Utilize shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Align memory access patterns within the warp to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to ensure data consistency when accessing shared memory.
// Minimize redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in registers or shared memory.
