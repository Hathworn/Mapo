```
// Optimize memory coalescing to improve access patterns
// Ensure alignment of shared memory allocation for efficient bank access
// Use const variables where possible to reduce register usage
// Consider unrolling loops to enhance performance on some hardware
// Use efficient warp-synchronous programming to reduce the need for __syncthreads
// Optimize global to shared memory transfers to minimize latency
