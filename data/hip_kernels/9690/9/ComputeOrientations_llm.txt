```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory loads.
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance for initializing histogram.
// Precompute Gaussian values outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.
// Use shared memory efficiently by reducing bank conflicts.
// Align memory accesses in shared memory to improve performance.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
