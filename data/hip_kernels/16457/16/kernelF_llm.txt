```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_x to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory if multiple threads within the block access the same data
// Try loop unrolling if applicable to improve instruction throughput
// Ensure d_y is aligned and consider using atomic operations if required for parallel writes
// Consider vectorized loads and stores for better memory operation efficiency
