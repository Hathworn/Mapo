```
// Use shared memory for commonly accessed values to reduce global memory transactions
// Prefetch yDotS and yDotY values to reduce latency when accessing global memory
// Align memory allocations to ensure coalesced accesses to global memory
// Consider using double buffering technique if kernel execution time allows
// Optimize condition checks to minimize branching and improve execution path
// Evaluate loop unrolling in case of repetitive computations for enhanced performance
