// Consider reducing register pressure by optimizing index calculations
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits
// Use loop unrolling for the inner loop over 'len' for potential speed gains
// Minimize memory bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Optimize memory accesses to utilize coalesced reads from global memory
