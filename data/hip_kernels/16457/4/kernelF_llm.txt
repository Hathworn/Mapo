```
// Consider using shared memory to cache d_xAx, d_bx, and d_c for better performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_xAx, d_bx, and d_c to improve memory throughput.
// Check if overlapping host and device computations can be implemented for better resource utilization.
// Optimize block size and grid size to avoid divergence and ensure full utilization of the GPU.
