```
// Reduce kernel launch overhead by eliminating unnecessary kernel calls
// Consider using shared memory for better data locality and reduced global memory access
// Minimize data transfer between host and device to improve performance
// Utilize memory coalescing techniques to improve global memory read/write efficiency
// Assess warp divergence and aim to minimize it for optimal performance
// Use appropriate block size and grid size for maximizing occupancy
