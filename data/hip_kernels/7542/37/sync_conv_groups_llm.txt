```
// Consider adding __shared__ memory for data if more complex logic is added in the future
// Ensure memory coalescing if accessing global memory in future iterations
// If possible, use fewer threads per block to allow for better occupancy and performance
// Evaluate if bank conflicts occur should shared memory be used, and mitigate them
// Identify any constant values that can be moved to __constant__ memory for faster access
// Utilize warp-level primitives for any future inter-thread communication
