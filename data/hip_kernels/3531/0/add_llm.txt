```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access if shared memory is used
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce latency
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
