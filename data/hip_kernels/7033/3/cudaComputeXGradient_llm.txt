```
// Use shared memory to cache portions of the channel array for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing memory accesses in a sequential order
// Consider unrolling the loop for smaller loop body and improved performance
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a block follow the same execution path
