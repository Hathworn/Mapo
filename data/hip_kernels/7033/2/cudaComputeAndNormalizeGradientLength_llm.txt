```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for channel_values to improve memory throughput.
// Try using shared memory for commonly accessed variables like x_gradient and y_gradient.
// Evaluate loop unrolling if applicable for larger iterative processes within the kernel.
// Assess potential benefits of using half precision if accuracy permits for faster calculations.
// Investigate if texture memory can effectively cache reads from x_gradient and y_gradient.
