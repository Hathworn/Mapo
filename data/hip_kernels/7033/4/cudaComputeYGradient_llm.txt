```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring access patterns are properly aligned.
// Minimize global memory access by maximizing the use of shared memory.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead, especially in critical sections.
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions.
// Balance the workload among threads to prevent underutilization of resources.
// Adjust block size and chunk_size_per_thread based on hardware to optimize performance.
// Identify and eliminate redundant or unnecessary operations to improve computation efficiency.
