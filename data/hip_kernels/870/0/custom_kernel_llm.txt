// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a continuous manner
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap computation and data transfer
// Align memory access patterns to improve cache performance
