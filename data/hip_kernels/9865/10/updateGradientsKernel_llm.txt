```cpp
// Consider coalesced access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Align memory accesses to a multiple of warp size to minimize memory transaction overhead
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring similar control flow for threads
```
