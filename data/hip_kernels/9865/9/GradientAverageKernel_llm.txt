```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory access by ensuring threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Use padding in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize shared memory usage to limit the number of reads and writes, e.g., reduce unnecessary overwrites.
// Pre-calculate repetitive computations outside of loops to minimize redundant calculations.
// Consider loop unrolling for the neighbor accumulation loop to improve performance.
// Use __ldg() to load read-only data to leverage read-only data cache where possible.
