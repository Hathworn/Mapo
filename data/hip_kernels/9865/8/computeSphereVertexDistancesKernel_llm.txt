```
// Use shared memory to cache vertex data for faster access
// Prefer shared memory when possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Use FMAD instructions for floating point arithmetic to improve performance
// Efficient threshold checks and calculations to minimize branch divergence
// Use fast math functions like __frsqrt_rn for reciprocal square root to improve performance
