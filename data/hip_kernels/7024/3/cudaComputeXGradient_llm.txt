```
// Ensure that shared memory accesses are coalesced
// Try to use larger block sizes for higher occupancy
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers for x_gradient and channel
// Optimize boundary conditions to reduce branching
// Use constant memory for x_kernel as it doesn't change
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
