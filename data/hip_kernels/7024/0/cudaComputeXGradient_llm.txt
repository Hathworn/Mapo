// Consider using 2D grid and block configuration for better spatial locality.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing kernel size and accesses.
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data to exploit caching for better performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for channel array to improve global memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling for the convolution operation to reduce instruction overhead.
