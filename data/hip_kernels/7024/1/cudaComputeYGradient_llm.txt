```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Use __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions after loading data into shared memory
// Optimize boundary checks to minimize unnecessary computations
// Consider loop unrolling for the gradient computation to reduce instruction overhead
