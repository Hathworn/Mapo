```
// Consider ensuring memory coalescing when accessing global memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize the use of atomic operations in global memory
// Avoid branch divergence within warps by aligning thread execution paths
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput when applicable
