```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize use of global memory by prioritizing register and shared memory where possible.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling if applicable for reducing the loop overhead.
// Align data structures to improve memory access speed and reduce bank conflicts.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and hardware utilization.
// Prefetch data judiciously to hide memory latency where feasible.
