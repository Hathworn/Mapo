```cpp
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory access efficiency
// Minimize shared memory usage where possible by reusing memory efficiently
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to optimize for loop execution at the cost of increased register usage
// Evaluate the use of warp shuffle operations to minimize shared memory synchronization overhead
