```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved performance.
// Minimize memory transfers by keeping data in shared memory.
// Use thread and block configuration to maximize occupancy.
// Avoid warp divergence by aligning the execution paths.
// Use memory access patterns that allow for L2 cache efficiency.
// Minimize register use to increase active blocks per multiprocessor.
