// Use shared memory for frequently accessed arrays like neuron_wise_conductance_traces to reduce global memory access.
// Use register variables for constants such as decay_term_values and reversal_values to minimize repeated memory fetching.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like decay_term_values when it provides performance benefits.
