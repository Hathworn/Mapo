```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access for d_spikes_travelling_to_synapse
// Consider using shared memory to buffer frequently accessed data such as synaptic_decay_id
// Ensure that d_time_of_last_spike_to_reach_synapse is accessed in a coalesced manner
// Reduce contention on atomic operations by minimizing the index range for neuron_wise_conductance_trace
// Align data structures to cache line size to improve access speed
// Pre-fetch data to registers before entering the while loop for faster access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if introduced
