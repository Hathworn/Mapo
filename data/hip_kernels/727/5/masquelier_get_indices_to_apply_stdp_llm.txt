```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring d_plastic_synapse_indices is accessed in a sequential pattern.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like d_postsyns to reduce global memory accesses.
// Avoid warp divergence by restructuring conditional statements to ensure threads within a warp follow the same path.
// Prefetch data from global to shared memory to reduce access latency.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments to indicate no overlapping, improving optimization.
