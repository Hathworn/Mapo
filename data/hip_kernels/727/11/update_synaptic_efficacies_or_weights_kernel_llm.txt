```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize conditional branching in the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
// Align thread usage to memory access patterns to enhance memory coalescing
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
