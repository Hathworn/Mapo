```c
// Use coalesced memory access for better global memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data such as d_param_a and d_param_b
// Prefetch data to reduce global memory latency
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for the while loop for additional performance gains
