// Use coalesced memory access for postsyn_neuron to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider pre-loading division values into shared memory for faster access.
// Ensure weight_divisor and current_weight accesses are coalesced to maximize memory throughput.
// Evaluate the impact of loop unrolling on performance for the inner loop.
