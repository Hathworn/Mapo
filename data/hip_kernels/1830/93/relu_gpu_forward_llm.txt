// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced accesses for better performance.
// Ensure the use of __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters if applicable to avoid unnecessary memory reads.
// Check if using half-precision floating-point can be beneficial to use less bandwidth.
