```
// Consider using shared memory for xyz1 and xyz2 to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have complete access to shared memory
// Pre-compute dx * dx, dy * dy, dz * dz for distance calculation to improve performance
// Minimize branching within loops for enhanced execution efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner neighbor search loop to reduce loop overhead
