// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory transactions.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and enhance performance.
// Evaluate if using texture memory could provide read-only cached access benefits.
