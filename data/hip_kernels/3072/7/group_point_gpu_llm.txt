```c
// Unroll loop j for better parallel execution and memory access optimization
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider shared memory to cache points data if it's reused, to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure enough threads are launched to fully utilize the GPU and improve load balancing
