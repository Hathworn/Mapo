```
// Consider using shared memory to buffer grad_out for improved read efficiency.
// Optimize the memory access pattern to ensure coalesced access for grad_out and grad_points.
// Ensure idx is accessed in a coalesced manner by aligning thread assignment properly.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by reducing contention on grad_points updates.
