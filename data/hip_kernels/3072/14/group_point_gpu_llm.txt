```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses for points and out arrays
// Ensure idx array access is coalesced for better performance
// Consider using float4 instead of float for vectorized memory access
// Align data to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Minimize idle threads by optimizing grid and block dimensions
// Experiment with different loop unrolling factors for optimal performance
