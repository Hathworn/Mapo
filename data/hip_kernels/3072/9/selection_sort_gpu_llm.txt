// Consider using shared memory for copying dist to out to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path during sort.
// Use memory coalescing when accessing dist and outi to increase memory read efficiency.
// Investigate using warp shuffle functions for more efficient parallel data exchange among threads.
// Explore loop unrolling to improve iteration efficiency in the innermost loops.
