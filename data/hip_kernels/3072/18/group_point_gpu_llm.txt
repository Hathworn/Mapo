```
// Use shared memory to cache points for better memory access patterns.
// Coalesce memory access when reading from 'points' to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Consider utilizing asynchronous memory copies for prefetching data.
// Optimize 'idx' memory access by using texture memory if supported by the hardware.
// Unroll inner loops to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy.
