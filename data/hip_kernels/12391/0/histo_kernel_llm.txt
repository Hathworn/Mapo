```
// Use shared memory for faster access to frequently accessed data
// Initialize shared memory for each thread block to reduce global memory traffic
// Calculate the index and stride for processing buffer elements efficiently
// Use atomic add for accurate histogram calculation and memory consistency
// Ensure all updates to shared memory are done before proceeding
// Use atomic add to update the global histogram, minimizing global memory access
