```cpp
// Use registers to reduce the number of global memory accesses, improving latency
// Unroll loops to decrease loop overhead and increase memory access coalescing
// Store frequently accessed data in shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed memory operations before proceeding
// Align memory accesses to warp boundaries to optimize coalescing and decrease bank conflicts
// Consider further unrolling if registers are available, to improve instruction parallelism
```
