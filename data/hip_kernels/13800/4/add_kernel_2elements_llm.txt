```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache block-level data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consolidate block offset calculations to minimize redundant operations.
// Use `__syncthreads()` to ensure data consistency after loading from global to shared memory.
// Optimize loop to minimize arithmetic operations within the loop.
// Consider unrolling loops manually to further optimize performance.
