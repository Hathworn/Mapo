```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Load histogram data to shared memory to optimize memory access
// Efficient conditional loading of data reduces unnecessary operations
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to minimize global memory access
// Unroll loops to improve performance and reduce branch divergence
// Sequence the index increments to minimize conditional checks
// Efficiently write results back to global memory to optimize performance
```
