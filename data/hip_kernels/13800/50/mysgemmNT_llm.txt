```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and enhance speed
// Ensure optimal memory access patterns by coalescing loads into shared memory
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded before computation
// Increase tile size if registers and shared memory resources permit
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput
