// Optimize the use of shared memory to minimize bank conflicts
// Consider using warp shuffle to reduce shared memory usage
// Reduce divergence by organizing threads to execute the same instruction path
// Avoid redundant memory accesses by caching repeated data computations in registers
// Efficiently balance workload among threads to maximize occupancy and minimize idle time
