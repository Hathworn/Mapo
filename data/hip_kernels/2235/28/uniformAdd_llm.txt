```cpp
// Consider coalesced access to global memory for better performance
// Minimize divergent branches for optimal execution
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure that memory accesses within warps are coalesced
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Ensure synchronization (__syncthreads()) is used to avoid data hazards
```
