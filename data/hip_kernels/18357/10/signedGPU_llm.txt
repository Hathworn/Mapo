```
// Consider using shared memory for same block data access patterns to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access for Ns and Ds arrays
// Use warp shuffle operations for reduction or combining results if applicable to reduce global memory access
// Check if Ns and Ds arrays can be double-buffered or pinned to improve memory bandwidth
// Evaluate using asynchronous memory copies and streams for overlapping computations with data transfers
