```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads for bottom_rois
// Precompute frequently used values like roi_width and bin sizes outside loops
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant calculations for bin sizes and transformed positions
// Unroll inner loops to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Consider using texture or L2 cache for bilinear_interp function data access if beneficial
// Fuse similar operations outside of nested loops to minimize redundant calculations
