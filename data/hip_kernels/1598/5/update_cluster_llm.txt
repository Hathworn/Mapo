```
// Consider minimizing global memory accesses by using shared memory for intermediate results.
// Use shared memory to store B_c, G_c, and R_c data to reduce redundant global memory reads within each block.
// Ensure all threads have finished writing to shared memory before performing the reduction to leverage shared memory benefits.
// Optimize global memory coalescing by aligning nValue, Bdata, Gdata, and Rdata accesses for each thread to consecutive memory locations.
// Implement warp-synchronous programming by removing unnecessary __syncthreads() inside the reduction loop if applicable on newer architectures.
