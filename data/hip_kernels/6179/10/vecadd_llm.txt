// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning data structures
// Use __restrict__ keyword to potentially improve load/store efficiency
// Explore the use of loop unrolling for better performance if applicable
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure maximum number of threads are running
