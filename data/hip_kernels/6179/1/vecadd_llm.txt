```
// Consider coalesced memory access for the input and output arrays.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is placed correctly to prevent race conditions.
// Use shared memory only when it can significantly reduce global memory access.
// Minimize the usage of shared memory if it does not provide a noticeable performance gain.
// Allocate shared memory as needed to avoid unnecessary overhead.
// Optimize block size based on the GPU architecture for better performance.
