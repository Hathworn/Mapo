```
// Use shared memory to optimize access and reduce global memory transactions
// Ensure the block size is a multiple of the warp size to maximize efficiency
// Ensure shared memory access is coalesced to improve performance
// Consider looping to handle larger data sets if shared memory is limited
// Align data structures with float4 for better memory alignment and access efficiency
