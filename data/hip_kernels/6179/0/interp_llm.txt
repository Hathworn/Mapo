```cpp
// Use __ldg() for reading data that is used multiple times to increase cache efficiency
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Minimize branch divergence by structuring conditions efficiently
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer arguments to enable additional compiler optimizations
