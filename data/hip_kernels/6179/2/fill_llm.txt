```c
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access wherever possible
// Make sure that the block size (BLOCK_SIZE) is chosen to maximize occupancy
// Consider other ways to leverage memory alignment for better performance
```
