```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced global memory reads and writes.
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Consider using warp shuffles to share data within a warp.
// Minimize data dependencies between threads for better parallel efficiency.
// Use appropriate memory hierarchy to reduce memory latency.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve memory access speed.
// Avoid memory bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce control overhead.
// Use texture memory if spatial locality in memory access patterns is present.
