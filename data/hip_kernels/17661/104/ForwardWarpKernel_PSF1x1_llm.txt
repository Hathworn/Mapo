```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce memory access for u and v to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure memory alignment for better performance with coalesced access.
// Evaluate if prefetching data into registers can reduce memory load latency.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to decrease loop overhead.
// Reuse loaded data among threads where possible to minimize memory transactions.
