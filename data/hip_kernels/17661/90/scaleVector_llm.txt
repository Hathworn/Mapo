```c
// Consider using shared memory if repeated access to the same data is needed.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to improve coalescing.
// Consider using float2 or float4 types for vectorized memory access.
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching if possible to hide memory latency.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
