```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved performance
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block
// Align memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts and ensure coalescence
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing condition checks
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from caching
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ to provide better compiler optimizations
```
