// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data appropriately
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Evaluate if texture memory can improve read performance
// Use __ldg intrinsic for read-only data to potentially increase cache hits
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for best occupancy and performance
