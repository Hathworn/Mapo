```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory transactions
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure the warp size is fully utilized by adjusting the block size
// Employ prefetching if applicable to hide global memory latency
