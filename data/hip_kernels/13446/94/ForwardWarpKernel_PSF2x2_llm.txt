```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for u and v arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Prefetch values of u, v, and src to shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure dst and normalization_factor are accessed in coalesced manner for better memory efficiency.
// Utilize warp-level atomic operations if possible to enhance performance with concurrent writes.
// Avoid recalculating stride offsets multiple times inside the loop by computing them once.
