```
// Coalesced memory access by using a single index calculation for both normalization_factor and image arrays
// Use shared memory if multiple threads within a block access the same normalization_factor values
// Consider using float4 or float2 data types for vectorized memory access
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for the specific GPU architecture in use
