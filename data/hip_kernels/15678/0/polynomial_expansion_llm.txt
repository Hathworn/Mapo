// Utilize shared memory to cache poly coefficients and reduce global memory access
// Consider using warp shuffle to reduce use of shared memory for poly coefficients
// Minimize access to array[index] by storing it in a register variable if possible
// Use loop unrolling technique to optimize polynomial computation
