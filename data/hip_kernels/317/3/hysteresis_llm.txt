// Ensure data layout optimization by using shared memory for neighbor accesses  
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to reduce global memory transactions  
// Ensure syncthreads usage to synchronize shared memory data access    
// Consider optimizing boundary checks to avoid unnecessary branching  
// Minimize redundant memory reads by storing needed values in shared memory
