```
// Consider using texture memory for source image access patterns.
// Load kernel into shared memory outside of thread blocks to reduce redundant loads.
// Tune block size to maximize occupancy and memory throughput.
// Align memory access by coalescing reads/writes to dst using float4 operations.
// Minimize if-condition checks during the computation for better performance.
// Ensure kernel memory is loaded in a coalesced manner and fits in shared memory efficiently.
// Consider loop unrolling for 5x5 kernel convolution to reduce loop overhead.
