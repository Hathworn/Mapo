```
// Use shared memory for constant kernel to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loading a larger region into shared memory to minimize repeated global memory accesses.
// Synchronize threads appropriately to ensure the kernel matrix is fully initialized before usage.
// Optimize boundary checks to reduce branch divergence.
// A reduction in loop unrolling could be considered for better performance with larger kernel sizes.
