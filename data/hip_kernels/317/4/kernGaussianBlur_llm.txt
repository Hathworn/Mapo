```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store portions of the input image to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by processing in a structure of arrays format.
// Unroll loops for kernel operations to reduce loop overhead.
// Minimize arithmetic operations inside the loops when calculating indices.
// Pre-compute kernel offset and neighbor checks to streamline the innermost loop.
