```
// Use shared memory to cache the input tile that the block is going to use
// Ensure coalesced memory access for reading input and writing output
// Consider unrolling loops for small kernel sizes to reduce loop overhead
// Try to minimize the number of branches inside loops to enhance warp execution efficiency
