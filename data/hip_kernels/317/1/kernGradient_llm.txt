```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load boundary data for halo cells to avoid conditional checks
// Minimize divergence by having all threads participate in similar operations
// Ensure shared memory access is coalesced to improve performance
// Synchronize threads to prevent read-after-write hazards
```
