```
// Ensure memory coalescing by having contiguous threads access contiguous data
// Use __restrict__ qualifier if applicable to improve compiler optimizations
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block
// Explore loop unrolling to increase throughput for larger data sizes
// Evaluate use of float4 or float2 for vectorized operations if memory alignment allows
