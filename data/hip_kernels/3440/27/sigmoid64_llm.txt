```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for coalesced memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize cache misses
// Use memory-prefetching techniques to hide memory latency
// Adjust grid and block dimensions for better occupancy
