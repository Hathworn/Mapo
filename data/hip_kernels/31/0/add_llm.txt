// Use shared memory for data that is accessed multiple times within the kernel to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning and organizing data arrays properly.
// Minimize divergent branching in kernels to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling for simple operations to reduce instruction overhead within the kernel.
