```
// Use blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x for unique thread index
// Use total threads to stride through the array
// Consider using shared memory to cache data that is accessed multiple times
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize memory access latency
