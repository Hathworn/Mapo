```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to maximize memory bandwidth
// Explore using shared memory if there is data reuse across threads
// Ensure proper alignment of data for coalesced memory access
// Check bank conflicts in shared memory if implemented
// Evaluate the use of memory prefetching for larger data sets
// Assess if loop unrolling could enhance performance
