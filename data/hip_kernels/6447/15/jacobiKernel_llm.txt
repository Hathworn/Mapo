```
// Precompute global indices if accessed multiple times
// Use shared memory to store tile data and reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring temperature accesses are aligned
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Ensure grid and block dimensions optimize for the GPU architecture
