// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Adjust TILE_SIZE according to hardware limits for optimal shared memory use
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure memory consistency and synchronization
// Load data into shared memory before computation to reduce redundant global memory access
// Optimize conditional checks to minimize branch divergence
// Preload neighboring elements into shared memory when possible to avoid conditional access outside shared memory
