// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading to shared memory
// Ensure shared memory is sized appropriately for thread count
// Consider coalesced access pattern when reading from global memory
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
