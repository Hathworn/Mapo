```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses
// Align data structures to improve memory coalescing and access patterns
// Utilize asynchronous memory copy operations to hide data transfer latencies
// Optimize block size and thread configuration for maximum occupancy and performance
```
