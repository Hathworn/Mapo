```
// Consider coalesced memory access for efficiency.
// Optimize data access by using shared memory if possible.
// Ensure that memory access patterns are optimized to avoid bank conflicts.
// Minimize divergence by structuring control flow to reduce condition checks.
// Use loop unrolling if it helps in improving performance.
// Balance grid and block size to ensure full utilization of the GPU.
