```cpp
// Consider using coalesced global memory access for g_idata and g_odata.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Unroll the loop to reduce loop control overhead.
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately to ensure data consistency.
// Employ warp shuffle techniques within the last warp for efficiency.
// Minimize conditional branching within warps to enhance performance.
