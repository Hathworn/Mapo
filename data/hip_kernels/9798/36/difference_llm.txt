```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for optimal performance
// Minimize branching by using warp-synchronous programming where possible
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data structures to 128 bytes to avoid bank conflicts
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable additional compiler optimizations
// Experiment with varying block sizes to identify optimal configuration
