```
// Optimize memory access by utilizing shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure shared memory usage is within hardware limits to prevent bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory load
// Consider unrolling loop for j to optimize performance further
// Check boundary conditions to prevent accessing out-of-bound indices
// Use atomic operations carefully to handle potential race conditions
