```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure efficient use of registers by minimizing variable usage within the kernel
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and load balance
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable to indicate no aliasing for pointer parameters
// Consider loop unrolling for instances where operations within loops need optimization
// Use appropriate compiler flags for better performance optimization
