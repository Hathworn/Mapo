```
// Use shared memory to cache factor if accessed repeatedly across thread blocks.
// Consider aligning memory accesses with warp boundaries to minimize bank conflicts.
// Optimize global memory access by using coalesced reads/writes.
// Evaluate blockDim and gridDim parameters for improved occupancy and performance.
// Review loop unrolling depth to ensure it balances register pressure and performance gains.
