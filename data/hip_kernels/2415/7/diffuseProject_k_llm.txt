// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for vx and vy within the loop.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimal to maximize GPU occupancy.
// Evaluate loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce loop overhead.
