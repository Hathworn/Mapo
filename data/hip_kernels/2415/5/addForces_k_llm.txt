```c
// Consider coalesced access by aligning threads with memory to improve memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to store commonly accessed values like tx_r4 and ty_r4 to reduce redundant calculations.
// Minimize divergent branches and ensure all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring proper alignment of data structures in memory.
