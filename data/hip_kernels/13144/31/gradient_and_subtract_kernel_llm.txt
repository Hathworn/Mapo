```
// Use shared memory to cache values of 'in' for faster memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses when reading from 'in' to improve bandwidth usage
// Consider loop unrolling for gradient calculations to reduce instruction overhead
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries to ensure optimal memory transactions
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Use texture memory for read-only data if spatial locality and cache coherency are expected
