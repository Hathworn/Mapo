// Use shared memory for data loading to reduce global memory access latency
// Use warp-level primitives to synchronize threads for efficient data sharing
// Unroll loops to maximize the utilization of computational units
// Align memory accesses to prevent bank conflicts and improve performance
// Employ coalesced access patterns for in1, in2, and out arrays for better memory throughput
