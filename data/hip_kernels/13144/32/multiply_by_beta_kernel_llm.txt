```
// Ensure efficient use of shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Consider using vectorized data loads/stores to increase memory throughput.
// Optimize memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling for operations within the kernel where applicable.
// Align data to address boundaries to avoid misaligned memory accesses.
