```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern when loading data into shared memory
// Synchronize threads after loading data to prevent race conditions
// Use conditional operator to minimize branching
// Synchronize threads before writing output to prevent race conditions
// Optimize memory bandwidth by using shared memory for intermediate results
