// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for data reuse.
// Simplify atomic operations by minimizing their usage to reduce contention.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring proper synchronization.
// Use parallel reductions to optimize sum and max computations.
// Balance workload by ensuring even distribution of threads for calculations.
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning loops and conditional logic efficiently.
// Prioritize coalesced memory access patterns for input and output arrays.
