// Consider using dynamic shared memory allocation to better handle varying block sizes.
// Reduce shared memory usage if block size is smaller than 256.
// Ensure kernel launch parameters are optimized for your specific hardware configuration.
// Evaluate if coalesced memory access patterns are possible for performance improvement.
// Assess the impact of block size on performance, especially concerning shared memory utilization.
