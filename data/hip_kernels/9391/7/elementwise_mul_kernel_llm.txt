```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring data is accessed in a sequential order
// Use shared memory if multiple threads need to access the same data for improved data locality
// Avoid uncoalesced memory access patterns by aligning data or optimizing data layout
// Experiment with block size and grid size to find the best configuration for the hardware
// Ensure proper memory access pattern to minimize memory latency
