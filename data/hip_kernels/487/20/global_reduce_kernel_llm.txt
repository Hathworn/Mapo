```
// Avoid uncoalesced global memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before starting the reduction
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing the amount of data stored per block
// Consider reducing the number of synchronization points if possible to improve performance
// Ensure that shared memory usage fits within the limits of the GPU being used to avoid spills into global memory
