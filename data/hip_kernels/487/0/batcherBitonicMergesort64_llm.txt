// Consider using coalesced access for d_in and d_out to improve memory throughput
// Explore the use of shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access
// Investigate using warp shuffle operations to reduce the need for shared memory synchronization
// Assess the necessity of __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead
