```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better performance
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() for synchronization correctness
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive operations if applicable
