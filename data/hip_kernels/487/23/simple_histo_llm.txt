```cpp
// Use shared memory to buffer partial histogram results to reduce global memory access
// Increase thread block size if the occupancy is not high enough to better utilize the GPU
// Ensure proper memory alignment to optimize memory access transactions
// Minimize warp divergence by reordering conditional statements if applicable
```
