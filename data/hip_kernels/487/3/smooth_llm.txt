```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store neighboring elements within a block to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same path.
// Ensure enough threads per block to maximize occupancy and hide latency.
// Use occupancy calculator tools to determine optimal block size for hardware.
