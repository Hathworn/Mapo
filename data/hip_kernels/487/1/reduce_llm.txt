```cpp
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp participate
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Leverage warp shuffling to minimize the use of shared memory
// Consider using cooperative groups for better warp synchronization
// Use atomic operations sparingly to avoid performance bottlenecks
```
