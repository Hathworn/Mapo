// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning data properly
// Minimize divergent branching within loops
// Evaluate loop unrolling for performance gains
// Utilize __restrict__ keyword to improve compiler optimizations
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency
