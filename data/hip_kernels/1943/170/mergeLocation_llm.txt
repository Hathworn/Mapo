// Ensure memory coalescing by using consecutive memory indices
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use __syncthreads() if modifying shared memory within the kernel
// Check if __fmul_rn() is the optimal choice for multiplication precision and performance
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data like loc_ to potentially improve performance
// Consider loop unrolling if parallelism across threads can be further optimized
