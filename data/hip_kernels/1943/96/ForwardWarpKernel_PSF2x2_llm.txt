```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data from global memory to reduce access latency.
// Ensure to leverage coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize atomic operations by minimizing contention; consider restructuring computations where feasible.
// Consider prefetching data into registers if subsequent access is predictably aligned.
