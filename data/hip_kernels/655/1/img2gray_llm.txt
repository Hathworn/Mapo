// Ensure the sharedInput array size is appropriate for the block size and number of channels
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling for loading data into shared memory
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
// Minimize global memory access by fully utilizing shared memory
// Sync threads only when necessary to minimize synchronization overhead
