// Consider using shared memory to cache gradOutput_data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align memory accesses to achieve coalesced memory transactions.
// Minimize divergent warps by ensuring branch conditions are uniform across threads.
// Ensure unroll factor matches scale_factor for optimal performance.
