```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if possible
// Coalesce global memory accesses in the read and write operations
// Optimize thread-block size for better memory access patterns
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergence and improve performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared or local memory
```
