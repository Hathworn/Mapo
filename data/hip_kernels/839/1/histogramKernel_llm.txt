```
// Consider coalesced memory access for the input image array
// Minimize use of atomic operations due to potential contention and serialization
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure sufficient shared memory allocation for the given histogram size
// Consider loop unrolling for initialization and accumulation operations
// Reduce syncthreads usage to avoid performance bottlenecks if possible
