```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to image[i] for improved performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance
// Minimize use of atomic operations to reduce serialization overhead
// Ensure memory alignment for better performance on modern GPUs
// Consider using warp-level primitives for histogram reduction in shared memory
