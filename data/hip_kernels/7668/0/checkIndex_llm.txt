```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and throughput.
// Minimize divergent branching within this kernel.
// Evaluate the use of warp-synchronous programming where applicable.
// Ensure that grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target architecture.
// Analyze the necessity of printf as it may impact performance and should be minimized in production.
