```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for arrays a, b, and c.
// Ensure that the arrays are aligned to avoid misaligned memory accesses.
// Evaluate using shared memory if data reuse is possible within a block.
// Check occupancy and adjust block size and grid size for optimal resource utilization.
// Review if asynchronous memory prefetching is beneficial for input arrays.
