```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory loads.
// Consider using a loop unrolling technique to optimize the stencil computation.
// Ensure shared memory usage is within hardware limits to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use __syncthreads() if needed to synchronize threads before stencil computation.
// Evaluate warp divergence when handling boundary checks and minimize where possible.
