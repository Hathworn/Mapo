// Ensure grid and block size are optimal for the hardware
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Adjust shared memory size based on blockDim.x for optimal utilization
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads during data load into shared memory
// Consider using loop unrolling for the addition operation for increased performance if applicable
