```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Ensure that arrays 'a', 'b', and 'c' are aligned to improve memory access efficiency
// Maximize occupancy by tuning block size relative to the number of GPU resources
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning shared memory access if shared memory is used
// Experiment with pre-loading data into shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory latency
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if possible to enable compiler optimizations
// Utilize vectorized data types if applicable to optimize memory transactions
