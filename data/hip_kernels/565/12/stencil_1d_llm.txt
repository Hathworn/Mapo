// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads from global memory.
// Evaluate the thread block size for optimal performance depending on hardware.
// Use __restrict__ keyword on pointer arguments to help the compiler optimize.
