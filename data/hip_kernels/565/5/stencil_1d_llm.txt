```cpp
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to help compiler with memory access optimization
// Consider loop unrolling for the stencil computation loop to reduce overhead
// Ensure that RADIUS and THREADS_PER_BLOCK are defined as compile-time constants for better optimization
// Avoid branching in the boundary check by computing boundary values outside the main kernel
// Utilize vectorized memory loads if possible to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure that temp shared memory accesses are coalesced to minimize bank conflicts
