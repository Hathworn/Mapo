```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve memory coalescing.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure that block dimensions are optimized for the target architecture.
// Consider loop unrolling for operations inside the general case to reduce overhead.
// Align data in global memory for better access efficiency.
