// Use shared memory for x and y arrays to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for xadv and yadv arrays.
// Consider unrolling the loop in locationAlgo for potential performance gains.
// Optimize locationAlgo to reduce branch divergence.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize the reduction operation in locationAlgo.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only x and y arrays.
