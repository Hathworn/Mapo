```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures to warp size boundaries
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Minimize memory access divergence by aligning accesses across warps
// Use vectorized loads/stores if applicable to improve memory throughput
```
