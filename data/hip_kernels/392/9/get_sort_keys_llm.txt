```
// Use local variables for repeated calculations to minimize pointer arithmetic.
/// Use shared memory if possible for input data that's accessed multiple times to reduce global memory access.
// Align memory access patterns to improve coalescing and throughput.
// Consider using atomic operations or warp-level primitives for synchronization if needed.
// Verify register and shared memory usage to ensure optimal occupancy.
