// Consider using shared memory to cache d_mapping, d_reduction, and old_d_ij_buf for faster access.  
// Align data structures to improve coalesced memory access and increase bandwidth utilization.
// Reduce global memory writes by using registers for frequently accessed variables like i and j.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergence and synchronize threads efficiently.  
// Minimize register usage by avoiding unnecessary temporary variables when possible.  
// Investigate loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead in computations.
