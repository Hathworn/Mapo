```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved performance
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse across threads is possible
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Prefetch data to registers where possible to reduce memory latency
// Align memory accesses to 4-byte boundaries if feasible for better throughput
// Use vectorized data types if applicable to exploit memory bandwidth
