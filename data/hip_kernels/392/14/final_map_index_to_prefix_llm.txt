```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with consecutive data in global memory
// Consider using shared memory to cache hash data if it is reused across threads
// Reduce global memory writes by storing intermediate results in registers when possible
// Optimize loop to avoid unnecessary calculations and minimize memory access latency
