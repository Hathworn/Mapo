// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads
// Explore using warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for efficient reduction
// Use appropriate synchronization to avoid race conditions during atomic operations
// Evaluate using double buffering techniques to enhance memory utilization
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts during reduction steps
