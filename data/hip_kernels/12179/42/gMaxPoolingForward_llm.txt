// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Opt for memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use loop unrolling in the for-loop to reduce workload per thread
// Consider using mixed precision if accuracy allows for it to increase throughput
// Ensure the use of restrict keyword for pointers if applicable to avoid aliasing overhead
