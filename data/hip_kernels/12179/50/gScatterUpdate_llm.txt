```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure to use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading to shared memory.
// Consider adjusting shared memory size for different block dimensions.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance.
// Check boundary conditions carefully to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.
