```
// Ensure src and tgt pointers are aligned for coalesced memory access
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for src and tgt pointers to aid in compiler optimization
// Precompute and use source memory access pattern to improve memory access efficiency
// Evaluate data locality and alignment to optimize cache usage
// Promote constants like srcWidth and srcHeight to avoid redundant calculations in the loop
// Consider loop unrolling if beneficial for GPU architecture and warp execution
