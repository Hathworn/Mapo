```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling for increased register utilization.
// Optimize reduction using warp-level programming.
// Use volatile keyword for warp reduction efficiency.
// Ensure full warp utilization for reduction steps.
// Accumulate results at block-level to finalize global memory access.
// Minimize synchronizations by efficient reduction steps.
