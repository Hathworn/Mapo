```c
// Enhance memory coalescing by ensuring threads in the same warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize divergence in warp execution by aligning loops to warps where possible.
// Evaluate potential benefits of using shared memory to buffer frequently accessed data.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead and improve instruction throughput.
// Assess memory access patterns and ensure they follow coalesced access rules.
// Ensure the memory accesses align with hardware specifications for optimal throughput.
// Consider prefetching data based on usage patterns to reduce latency.
// Analyze potential for reducing global memory accesses by increasing data reuse.
