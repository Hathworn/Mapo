```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Opt for 1D grid and block configurations to maximize data throughput
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for increased efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for potential performance improvement
// Utilize hip-specific intrinsics for optimized atomic operations if applicable
```
