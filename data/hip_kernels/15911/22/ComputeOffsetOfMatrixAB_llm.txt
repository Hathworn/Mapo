```
// Use shared memory to cache row_sum and col_sum to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using a warp shuffle to minimize redundant loads across thread block.
// Use fewer global memory accesses by computing shared indices where possible.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve throughput.
