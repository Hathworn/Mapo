```
// Unroll loop for better performance by reducing branch divergence
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve bandwidth utilization
// Perform reduction using shared memory, ensuring coalesced accesses to reduce contention
// Synchronize threads effectively to prevent race conditions during reduction
// Optimize memory access patterns for gradient computation to maintain coalesced reads and writes
