```
// Use shared memory efficiently by ensuring correct allocation size.
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern when reading inputs_d.
// Reorder weight accesses to achieve better memory coalescing.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead for fixed sizes.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Minimize usage of atomic operations due to performance cost.
// Opt for using warp-level primitives instead of __syncthreads() where possible.
// Evaluate using __expf() for faster exponentiation in the kernel.
