```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sweeper_pos_v and mine_pos_v are accessed in sequence
// Minimize branch divergence by re-evaluating conditionals
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to leverage texture cache
// Consider loop unrolling if iterative processes are present
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce use of shared memory
// Align data structures to improve coalesced access patterns
