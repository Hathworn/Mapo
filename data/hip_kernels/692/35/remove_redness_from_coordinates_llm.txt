```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_coordinates to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store portions of d_r, d_b, and d_g that are accessed multiple times.
// Launch multiple smaller blocks to increase occupancy by improving parallelism.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring proper alignment.
// Preload data into registers to reduce global memory access latency.
// Explore using texture or surface memory for read-only data to leverage caching.
