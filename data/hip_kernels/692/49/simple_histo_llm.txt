```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Consider initializing shared_bins with multiple threads for speed
// Ensure shared memory is evenly accessed to optimize memory bandwidth
// Use atomic operations to avoid race conditions in shared memory
// Efficiently aggregate shared results to global memory to reduce congestion
// Use memory coalescing techniques when reading from global to shared memory
