```
// Ensure memory coalescing by contiguous threads accessing contiguous memory locations
// Evaluate the use of shared memory if data reuse can occur within a block
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block for better parallelism
// Analyze the bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Implement loop unrolling if beneficial for your specific workload
// Check for the possibility of using warp shuffle for data exchange
