```
// Ensure coalesced access to dataDevice by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory fetches for group statistics
// Optimize indexing to avoid recalculating indices within inner loops
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning shared arrays on warp size boundaries
