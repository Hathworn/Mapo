// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for gradOutput_data to improve coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses for gradOutput_data
// Evaluate potential benefits of using vectorized reads and writes
// Consider unrolling the inner loops to enhance performance
// Assess if reducing the number of arithmetic operations within loops can enhance performance
