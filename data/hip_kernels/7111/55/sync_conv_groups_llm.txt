// Consider minimizing register usage to optimize for occupancy
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced
// Explore using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Investigate asynchronous memory prefetching for overlapping computation with data transfer
// Analyze and optimize for memory bank conflicts
// Evaluate the use of memory access patterns to improve cache efficiency
// Check global memory alignment to avoid performance penalties
