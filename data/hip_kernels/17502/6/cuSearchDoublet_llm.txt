```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently used variables
// Coalesce global memory accesses for spMmat, spBmat, and spTmat to improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize branching by restructuring conditions to increase warp coherence
// Use local variables instead of repeatedly accessing global memory locations like *nSpB or *nSpT
// Prefetch necessary data into registers at the start of the loop to hide memory latency
// Avoid shared memory bank conflicts by aligning shared memory accesses
// Consider using unified memory to simplify data management and potentially reduce overhead
