```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for templates to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use `__restrict__` keyword for pointers if they do not overlap to help compiler optimize memory loads.
// Allocate shared memory more intelligently to fit precisely the needed portion, reducing bank conflicts.
// Attempt to minimize the use of atomic operations if present.
// Optimize load instructions by accessing global memory in a strided pattern if applicable.
// Consider using `warpShuffle` functions to optimize reductions within a warp.
// Ensure that shared memory usage remains within the hardware limits to avoid performance bottlenecks.
// Analyze whether using register blocking can help in further optimizing memory accesses.
