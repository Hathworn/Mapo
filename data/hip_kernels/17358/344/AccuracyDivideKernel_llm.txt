// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure proper memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Investigate warp-level primitives for efficient data sharing
// Evaluate potential use of registers to minimize memory latency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better resource utilization
