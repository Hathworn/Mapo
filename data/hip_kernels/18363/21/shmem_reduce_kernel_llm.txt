```
// Use memory coalescing to optimize global memory access patterns.
// Align shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts.
// Prefer to use __ldg() for read-only data in shared memory if applicable.
// Minimize usage of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to avoid using shared memory in the last steps.
