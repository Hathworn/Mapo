// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for bin updates
// Implement warp-level reduction to further optimize shared memory usage
// Consider loop unrolling if accessing multiple elements per thread
// Evaluate memory coalescing to improve read/write efficiency
// Investigate bank conflicts and shared memory padding to optimize access
