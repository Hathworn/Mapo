// Consider using larger block sizes to increase memory coalescing and improve performance
// Utilize shared memory for temporary storage to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Ensure proper alignment of memory accesses to maximize memory throughput
// Explore using warp shuffle operations for faster intra-warp communication
