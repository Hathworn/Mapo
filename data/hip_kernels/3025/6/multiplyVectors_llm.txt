```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access patterns and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure that accessing shared and global memory is coalesced whenever possible
// Load data into shared memory in chunks to minimize costly accesses to global memory
// Synchronize threads with __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have finished loading into shared memory before computation
// Consider aligning memory accesses and using vectorized loads/stores for additional performance improvements
