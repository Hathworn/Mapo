// Consider using warp-synchronous programming to minimize conditional checks.
// Ensure data is coalesced for memory read/write operations.
// Evaluate benefits of reducing grid and block dimensions for optimized occupancy.
// Use shared memory only if it leads to reduced global memory accesses.
// Check if reducing the number of printf can enhance performance.
