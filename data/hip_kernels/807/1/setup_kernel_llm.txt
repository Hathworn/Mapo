```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Assess if reducing block size enhances cache utilization
// Investigate if loop unrolling could further optimize thread execution
// Analyze if using const memory for frequently accessed data improves speed
```
