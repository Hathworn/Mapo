// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization for performance gain
// Minimize branch divergence by structuring conditional statements efficiently
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce memory access delay
