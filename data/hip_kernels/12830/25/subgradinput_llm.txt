```
// Use shared memory to cache common subexpressions for reduced global memory traffic.
// Unroll inner loops for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Employ warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Preload data into registers to reduce redundant access.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy.
// Consider using half-precision if accuracy permits for higher memory bandwidth.
