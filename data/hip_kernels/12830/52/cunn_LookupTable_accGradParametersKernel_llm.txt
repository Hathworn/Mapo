// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring adjacent threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for reused data
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointer arguments to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by tuning block size and grid size
