```
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for reduced global memory access
// Align memory accesses for gradInput_data to improve coalesced memory access
// Consider using texture memory for gradOutput_data to take advantage of caching
// Opt for asynchronous memory copies if applicable to overlap computation with data movement
// Minimize divergent branches, especially within the loop, to improve warp execution efficiency
