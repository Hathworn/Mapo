```
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Use shared memory to buffer data that can be reused by multiple threads
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries to fully utilize memory bandwidth
// Optimize for memory access patterns by minimizing strided accesses
// Use atomic operations sparingly as they serialize memory access and can reduce performance
