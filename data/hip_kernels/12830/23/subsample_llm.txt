```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache input tiles for faster access
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use the __restrict__ qualifier to optimize pointer aliasing
// Preload weights and biases into shared memory if reused frequently
// Ensure output calculation is well aligned with warp size for efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches within loops for better performance
```
