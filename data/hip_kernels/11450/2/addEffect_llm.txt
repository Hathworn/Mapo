```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for common operations
// Consider texture memory usage for input_img because of spatial locality
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Iterate over blocks in a more optimal order to improve memory coalescing
// Avoid redundant memory accesses by caching frequently accessed values
