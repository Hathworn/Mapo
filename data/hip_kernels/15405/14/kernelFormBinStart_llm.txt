```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for devInputBinCirPairBin to improve memory bandwidth.
// Utilize shared memory more effectively by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to optimize memory throughput.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization to reduce overhead.
