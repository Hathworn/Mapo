```
// Consider using __launch_bounds__ to optimize kernel launch for specific hardware
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for kernel arguments to improve memory access performance
// Align shared memory usage to 32-byte boundaries to avoid bank conflicts
// Explore using cooperative groups' thread synchronization for better performance control
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits to prevent occupancy reduction
// Cache frequently accessed data in registers when possible
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp to improve execution efficiency
// Consider using built-in functions for bit manipulation to improve performance
// Merge warp synchronous operations to reduce instruction count and increase performance
// Prefetch or reorder memory accesses to minimize memory latency
// Evaluate if using local memory could better utilize hardware resources
