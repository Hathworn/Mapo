// Consider using warp shuffle operations to optimize intra-warp communication.
// Explore the use of shared memory to store frequently used values, reducing global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for reading from compressed_data_buffer_in.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage by leveraging warp-level primitives.
// Consider optimizing the prefix sum calculation using warp-level operations to reduce shared memory dependency.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory accesses to ibufs[] and resolve them.
