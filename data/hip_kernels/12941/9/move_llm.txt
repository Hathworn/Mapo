```
// Consider coalesced access to global memory for better performance.
// Ensure shared memory usage is within the hardware limit to prevent overflows.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before reading from shared memory.
// Avoid zeroing out data in global memory unless necessary to save time.
// Consider optimizing the number of threads per block to utilize more parallelism.
