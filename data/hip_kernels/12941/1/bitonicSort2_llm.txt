```
// Minimize global memory access by reusing data in shared memory when possible.
// Coalesce global memory access for better memory throughput.
// Utilize int4 data type to reduce the number of memory accesses.
// Unroll loops to reduce overhead and improve performance.
// Ensure data alignment for efficient memory transactions.
// Consider using shared memory to hold data between steps, reducing repeated global memory access.
// Profile the kernel to identify potential bottlenecks in memory access patterns.
// Use conditional operators efficiently to eliminate unnecessary branches.
