```
// Ensure alignment of float* accuracy to optimize memory access
// Consider using shared memory if *accuracy is used frequently within a block
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// If the kernel is part of a larger computation, consider fusing kernels to reduce global memory traffic
