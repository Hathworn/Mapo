```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Optimize thread block size to match warp size for better performance.
// Utilize loop unrolling if applicable to optimize interpolation calculation.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
