// Consider coalesced memory access for 'a' and 'x' to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Attempt to reduce shared memory bank conflicts when accessing 'dots_s'.
// Double-check for optimal shared memory size in relation to 'n' to maximize occupancy.
// Evaluate occupancy and thread block size to improve SM utilization.
