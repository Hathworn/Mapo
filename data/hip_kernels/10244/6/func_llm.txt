```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Align data accesses to facilitate coalesced memory loads
// Minimize divergent branches within warp
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to improve occupancy
// Consider using vectorized data types for loading and storing
// Reduce register pressure by using local variables efficiently
// Pre-fetch data needed for calculations to hide latency
