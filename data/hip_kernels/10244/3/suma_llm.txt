```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns where possible
// Minimize divergence by structuring conditional branches appropriately
// Consider minimizing the kernel launch overhead for such small computations by using host-side computations if feasible
// Evaluate if memory management strategies like caching or shared memory could benefit more complex uses of the kernel
