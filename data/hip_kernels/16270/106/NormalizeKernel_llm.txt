```
// Use shared memory for better memory access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling for processing multiple elements per thread.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations if applicable.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for improved performance.
// Consider memory prefetching strategies to hide latency.
