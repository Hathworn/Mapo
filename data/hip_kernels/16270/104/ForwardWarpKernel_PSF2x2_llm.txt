```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Utilize texture or surface memory for read-only data that is spatially coherent.
// Coalesce memory access patterns for `src`, `u`, and `v` arrays to enhance memory throughput.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads in the warp follow the same execution path when possible.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for optimization when applicable.
// Analyze and optimize atomic operations usage as they may cause significant serialization.
