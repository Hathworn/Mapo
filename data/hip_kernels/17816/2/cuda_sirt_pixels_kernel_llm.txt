```
// Use shared memory for partial sums to reduce global memory access
// Assuming blockDim.x <= 256, adjust shared memory allocation accordingly
// Ensure all threads have computed their partial sum with __syncthreads()
// Utilize reduction within a block to minimize global memory usage
// Only thread 0 should write the result back, reducing redundant updates
