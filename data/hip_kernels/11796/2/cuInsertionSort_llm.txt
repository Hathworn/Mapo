// Optimize shared memory allocation by using smaller blocks
// Consider maximizing data reuse by leveraging loop unrolling
// Use of shared memory reduces global memory access overhead
// Ensure memory coalescing for efficient global memory access
// Explore warp synchronous programming for performance gain
// Consider restructuring if-statements to minimize branching
