```
// Consider increasing shared memory usage by tiling to further reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput.
// Ensure each thread block has sufficient occupancy to hide memory latency.
// Minimize divergence within threads of a warp to enhance performance.
// Review the balance between computational arithmetic intensity and memory bandwidth.
// Investigate potential benefits of employing larger tiles or overlapping computation with memory operations.
