// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses within the inner loop.
// Minimize divergent branches in the inner loop for consistent warp execution.
// Note the potential for increasing block size to optimize memory throughput.
// Consider Shared Memory Utilization for the frequently accessed variables.
