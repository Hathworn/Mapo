```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for d_row_nz[i] to improve memory throughput
// Replace atomic operations with warp-level primitives to reduce contention
// Use shared memory to accumulate bin sizes locally before writing back to global memory
// Reduce __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead
// Explore loop unrolling for the for-loop to reduce execution time
