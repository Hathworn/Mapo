```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve access times.
// Prefetch data into registers if possible to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifiers to inform the compiler that pointers do not alias, potentially improving optimization.
// Check for warp divergence, as conditional statements may cause some threads to be inactive.
