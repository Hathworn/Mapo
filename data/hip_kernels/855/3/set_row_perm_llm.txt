```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for bin_size and bin_offset
// Reduce global memory accesses through shared memory caching
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have updated shared memory before proceeding
// Apply loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and improve performance 
// Ensure correct synchronization back to global memory with atomic operations
```
