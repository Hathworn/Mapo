```
// Use grid-stride loop for improved parallelism to handle more elements.
// Consider accessing memory in a coalesced manner to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure the number of threads is a multiple of the warp size for efficiency.
// Explore using shared memory if there are frequent accesses to the same data.
