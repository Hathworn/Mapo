```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses if permutation array is frequently accessed
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements
// Consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization if necessary
// Ensure enough threads are launched to fully utilize the GPU
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy
