```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve throughput and reduce overhead.
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy and efficiency.
// Use warp-level primitives to maximize parallel execution within a block.
