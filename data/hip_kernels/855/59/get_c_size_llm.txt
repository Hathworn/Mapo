```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures if necessary
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize usage of atomic operations to avoid serialization overheads
// Consider using Warp-level primitives to optimize reduction tasks
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency
