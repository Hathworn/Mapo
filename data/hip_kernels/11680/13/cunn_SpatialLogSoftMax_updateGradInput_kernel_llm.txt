// Consider using shared memory to store temporary sums to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Optimize index calculations by using local variables to minimize redundant computations. 
// Check if reading gradOutput could be coalesced for better memory access efficiency.
// Look into overlapping computation with memory transfers using asynchronous copies where possible.
