```
// Consider coalesced memory access to gradOutput array for improved performance
// Optimize access pattern for gradInput to ensure memory coalescing
// Reduce the number of atomicAdd operations where possible to increase efficiency
// Align thread and block dimensions with memory hierarchy to fully utilize bandwidth
// Minimize the use of global memory accesses by reusing data if possible
// Look into reducing grid and block dimensions if the workload per block is small
