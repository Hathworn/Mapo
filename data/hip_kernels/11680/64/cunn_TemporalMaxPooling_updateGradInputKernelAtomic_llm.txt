```
// Consider adjusting shared memory usage to optimize memory accesses
// Use memory coalescing techniques to improve global memory access
// Unroll loops further if input_n is fixed and small to improve instruction throughput
// Optimize atomic operations by minimizing conflicts to enhance performance
