```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data to the warp size
// Use shared memory to cache submatrix tiles used by multiple threads
// Optimize global memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Consider loop unrolling further or using vectorized loads/stores if beneficial
// Evaluate use of constant memory if weight values don't change often
```
