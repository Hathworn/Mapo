```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Align data structures for optimal memory access patterns.
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency.
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain thread efficiency.
