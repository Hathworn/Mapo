```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if operands are reused frequently
// Avoid warp divergence by aligning memory accesses
// Minimize global memory transactions by optimizing data layout
// Prefetch data to cache if applicable
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
