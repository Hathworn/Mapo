```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to increase bandwidth efficiency
// Ensure adequate occupancy by tuning block size to better utilize GPU resources
// Use shared memory to reduce latency from global memory access if applicable
// Analyze warp divergence and optimize branching structure
// Leverage vectorized memory operations if supported to widen memory fetches
// Align memory allocations to 128/256 bytes boundaries for better performance
