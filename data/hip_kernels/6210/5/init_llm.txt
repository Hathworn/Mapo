// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible
// Consider using a cooperative launch for better grid management
// Align data access to avoid memory bank conflicts
// Optimize thread workload balance by ensuring each block works on an equal amount of data
// Minimize the usage of printf as it can perturb kernel performance
