// Consider coalesced memory access for `point` to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate if shared memory can be used to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize NLOOPS as a tunable parameter for performance balancing between computation and memory access.
// Verify grid and block dimensions to ensure maximum GPU utilization.
