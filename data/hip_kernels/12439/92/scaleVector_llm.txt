```c
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring data is accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Utilize shared memory if data reuse within a block is possible to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using compiler flags for additional optimization and efficiency.
// Minimize branch divergence within the kernel to enhance performance.
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and utilize available resources efficiently.
