```c
// Use coalesced memory access by aligning thread accesses to consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if the accesses to loc_ are non-coalesced
// Optimize scale computation by checking if constant memory can be leveraged
// Ensure data is read efficiently from global memory
```
