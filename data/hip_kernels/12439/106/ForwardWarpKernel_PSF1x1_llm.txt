```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency
// Ensure all memory reads and writes are coalesced to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Use texture memory for read-only data to improve cache performance
// Utilize __ldg() intrinsic for faster read from global memory
// Ensure that each thread accesses contiguous memory locations to improve cache efficiency
// Avoid divergent branching within warp by aligning control flow paths
