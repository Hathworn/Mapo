```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory writes
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access patterns
// Reuse pre-computed indices to avoid redundant calculations
// Investigate the impact of using float2 for potential vectorized writes
// Profile memory access patterns to identify alignment issues
// Ensure that memory transactions are aligned with cache lines
// Explore half-precision floats if precision allows to reduce memory bandwidth
