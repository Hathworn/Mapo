```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring aligned memory access.
// Consider using shared memory for better memory coalescing.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are chosen to fully utilize the GPU's resources.
// Avoid warp divergence by maintaining uniform execution paths within a warp.
// Profile the kernel to identify any remaining memory access inefficiencies.
