```
// Streamline memory usage by optimizing shared memory allocation for patches
// Optimize gaussian filter computation by using fewer arithmetic operations
// Remove redundant computations in compare_patches function
// Use a single conditional structure to load mirrored pixels efficiently into shared memory
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access during patch comparison
