```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data properly
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for increased memory throughput
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data to optimize performance
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution
