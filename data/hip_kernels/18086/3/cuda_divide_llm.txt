```
// Consider coalescing memory access for numerator and denominator arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency for the numerator and denominator arrays.
// Ensure memory alignment for the dst array to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Analyze and optimize the grid and block dimensions to achieve optimal occupancy.
// Avoid using printf for debugging in kernel functions as it can significantly impact performance.
