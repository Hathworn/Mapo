```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for better performance
// Use loop unrolling to optimize data transfer for numChannel == 3
// Consider launching the kernel with an optimal block size to maximize occupancy
// Evaluate potential benefits of using texture memory for read-only data if applicable
