// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths within warps
// Use compile-time constants for block and grid dimensions when possible
// Optimize for liveness and register pressure to improve occupancy
