// Consider optimizing the size of shared memory arrays based on actual block size used
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring proper memory alignment
// Minimize use of __syncthreads for efficiency; use only when necessary
// Ensure loop unrolling if applicable for better throughput
