// Consider using cooperative groups for finer synchronization and handling multidimensional arrays
// Use thread coarsening to increase the computational work per thread
// Try to ensure that vector_in size does not exceed shared memory limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling in the matrix-vector multiplication section
