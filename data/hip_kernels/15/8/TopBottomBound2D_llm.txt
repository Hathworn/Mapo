// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like Hs, Ztopo to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for Hs and Ztopo arrays to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize memory access for K2s and K2n arrays by aligning with 128-byte cache lines for effective use of global memory transactions.
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of warp size (usually 32) for maximum efficiency.
