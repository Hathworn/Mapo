```c
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize latency of global memory access.
// Consider adjusting the block size to improve occupancy and memory coalescing.
// Align data structures to improve memory access speed and efficiency.
