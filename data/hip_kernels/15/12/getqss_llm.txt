```cpp
// Use shared memory for repetitive data to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce memory access to IN array for improving bandwidth utilization
// Ensure IN and qss arrays are aligned to allow coalesced access
// Consider loop unrolling techniques if applicable to reduce overhead
```
