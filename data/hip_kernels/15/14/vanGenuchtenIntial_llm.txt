// Consider using shared memory for caching frequently accessed variables
// Minimize the use of pow() function due to its computational cost, can use multiplication for small integer exponents
// Perform memory coalescing by organizing the arrays to match access patterns
// Avoid branching within divergent warp execution, try to reduce conditional checks
// Align memory access patterns with cache lines for better performance
