// Use shared memory for storing intermediate values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider tiling strategies to improve memory coalescing and reduce bank conflicts.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block dimensions to maximize resource utilization.
// Use __restrict__ keyword with pointers to aid compiler optimizations on memory access.
