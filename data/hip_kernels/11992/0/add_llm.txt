```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data elements when block reuse is possible
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory accesses for 'a' and 'b'
// Align data accesses to 128-byte boundaries for better cache efficiency
// Evaluate memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory (if used)
