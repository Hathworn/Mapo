```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with data layout
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for better data reuse
// Pre-compute repeated index calculations outside of inner loops
// Unroll loops further if scale_factor is known at compile time
// Consider using warp-level shuffles or reduce for accumulation
// Use __syncthreads() after loading data into shared memory to avoid race conditions
