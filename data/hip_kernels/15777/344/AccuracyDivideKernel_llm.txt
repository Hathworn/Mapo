```
// Consider using __ldg() to load *accuracy for potentially better memory access patterns
// Ensure proper memory alignment of *accuracy for improved coalesced access
// Use shared memory if *accuracy is updated frequently within the kernel
// Prefer atomicAdd for accumulation rather than atomicExch if applicable
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives for finer granularity in atomic operations
