```
// Ensure efficient use of shared memory by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Optimize memory access patterns for input and kernel to improve data locality.
// Consider preloading parts of input data into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Minimize redundant calculations and data fetching through loop unrolling and efficient thread utilization.
// Balance thread workload distribution to avoid idle threads.
// Assess the impact of thread and block configurations on kernel performance.
