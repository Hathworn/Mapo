```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access if data reuse occurs within a block
// Consider using float4 type for vectorized loads/stores if INCX and INCY allow it and data alignment is ensured
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to ensure full occupancy and efficient hardware utilization
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by adjusting INCX and INCY if possible
// Minimize divergent branches to ensure efficient execution across warps
```
