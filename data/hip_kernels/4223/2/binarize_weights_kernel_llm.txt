```
// Load data into shared memory in coalesced fashion to improve memory access patterns.
// Implement loop unrolling for the reduction loop to achieve better performance.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reductions instead of shared memory for lower latency.
// Align shared memory usage to 32 bytes to prevent bank conflicts.
// Pre-fetch memory as much as possible outside critical sections to hide memory latencies.
