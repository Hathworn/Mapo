```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses as much as possible
// Perform parallel reduction to efficiently find the largest element
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads complete operations before proceeding
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory loads and stores
// Use atomic operations to safely update shared variables in a parallel context
```
