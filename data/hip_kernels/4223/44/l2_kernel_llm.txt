```
// Use grid-stride loop to improve GPU occupancy and ensure scalability
// Optimize memory access patterns to leverage coalesced reads from global memory
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse across threads within a block is observed
// Use float2 or vectorized loads if possible to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize thread and block dimensions for better hardware efficiency
