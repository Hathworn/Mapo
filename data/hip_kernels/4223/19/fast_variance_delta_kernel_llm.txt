```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced global memory accesses.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during reduction.
// Evaluate the use of warp-synchronous programming for reduction instead of __syncthreads().
// Minimize thread divergence by avoiding conditional statements inside the loop.
// Investigate the possibility of loop unrolling for the innermost loop for performance benefits.
