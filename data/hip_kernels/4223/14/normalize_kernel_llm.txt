```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous memory accesses for threads in a warp.
// Utilize shared memory to cache mean and variance values to reduce global memory access.
// Make sure `variance[f]` is stored in a register to minimize repeated memory fetch within the loop.
// Balance the grid and block dimensions to fully utilize the GPU and avoid underutilization.
