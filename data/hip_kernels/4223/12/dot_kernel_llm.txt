// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Avoid calculating sqrt multiple times; use a temporary variable for storing results.
// Use __syncthreads() carefully to avoid unnecessary synchronization and improve performance.
// Consider using loop unrolling inside the innermost loop for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access patterns for output array.
