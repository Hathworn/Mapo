```
// Precompute B1_t and B2_t outside the loop to reduce repetitive calculations.
// Calculate the linear index once to minimize overhead inside the kernel.
// Check index boundary condition early to avoid unnecessary computations.
// Use registers efficiently by minimizing repeated memory access.
