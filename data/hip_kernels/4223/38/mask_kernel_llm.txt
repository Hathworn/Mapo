```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to improve memory access performance by indicating no aliasing
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved throughput by aligning data appropriately
// Use shared memory to cache `mask` if there's significant reuse within the warp
// Explore using warp-level primitives to reduce branching overhead in the conditional statement
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing condition checks or data as feasible
// Assess if prefetching `mask` and `x` values can reduce latency
// Evaluate grid and block size configurations for optimal occupancy
