```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Rearrange loop order or use a different access pattern to improve coalesced memory access.
// Unroll inner loops to reduce loop overhead and potentially increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency by overlapping computation with memory accesses.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and resource utilization.
