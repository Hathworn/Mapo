```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for X and Y arrays 
// Use shared memory for temporary storage if needed for better performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access if shared memory is used
// Consider using vectorized operations for further optimization
// Ensure efficient warp utilization by aligning work to warp size
