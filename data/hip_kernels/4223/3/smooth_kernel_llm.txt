```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring that threads in the same warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure all operations within the kernel are designed to avoid unnecessary memory traffic.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for the neighborhood data to increase reuse and reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Double-check the loading of x[out_index] into a register to avoid redundant global memory accesses.
// Minimize divergence in condition checks to ensure warp efficiency, especially in boundary checks.
// Assess the benefit of loop unrolling for the inner loop over 'm' to improve performance.
