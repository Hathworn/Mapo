```
// Consider using shared memory to store partial results for faster access.
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory performance.
// Minimize the divergence in the reduction loops.
// Precompute more indices and coefficients outside of inner loops.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit the accumulation loop.
// Consider aligning memory accesses to CUDA warp boundaries.
