// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for large datasets
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure continuous memory access and improve coalescing
// Initialize accumulators with a reduction approach to minimize warp divergence
// Ensure memory alignment for x and mean arrays to leverage faster memory transactions
// Investigate possible use of vectorized memory operations for x array to enhance throughput
