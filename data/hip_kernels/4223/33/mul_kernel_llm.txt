```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure alignment of X and Y data for efficient access.
// Investigate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory load/store operations.
// Explore loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Profile memory throughput to identify bottlenecks.
// Use __restrict__ keyword to help the compiler with memory aliasing assumptions.
