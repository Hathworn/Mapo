// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced writes to the output array
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Balance between block size and occupancy for optimal performance
// Consider loop unrolling for the accumulation loop
