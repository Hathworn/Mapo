```
// Consider using shared memory for input data to improve memory access speed.
// Pre-load relevant input data block into shared memory before processing.
// Align memory accesses for both input and output to improve coalescing.
// Unroll loops where possible to increase instruction throughput.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring similar execution paths within warp.
