```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache accesses to delta and reduce global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling within the inner loop for greater efficiency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring delta accesses are aligned and contiguous.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring kernels are executed with enough occupancy.
// Ensure variance is loaded once per filter to minimize redundant global memory reads.
