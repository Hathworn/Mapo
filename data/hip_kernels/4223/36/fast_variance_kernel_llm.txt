```
// Load the mean value once for each filter to reduce redundant global memory access
// Use shared memory to accumulate data and reduce global memory writes
// Use an intermediate variable for difference squared to avoid repeated calls to powf
// Ensure threads are used efficiently by looping with step size equal to total threads per block
// Accumulate results in shared memory and synchronize to avoid race conditions
// Perform the final variance computation using only a single thread to minimize global memory access
