```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure INCX and INCY lead to contiguous memory accesses for better caching
// Evaluate using shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory accesses
// Use block size that is a multiple of the warp size to maximize warp occupancy
// Minimize divergent execution with uniform thread workloads within a warp
