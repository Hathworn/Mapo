```
// Consider utilizing shared memory more effectively to cache input data
// Implement efficient memory access patterns to reduce global memory traffic
// Utilize loop unrolling for the reduction phase to minimize loop overhead
// Optimize loop bounds or conditions for the reduction loop to enhance performance
// Consider warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for reduction across threads
// Implement coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Use #pragma unroll for loops to potentially improve performance by unrolling loops
