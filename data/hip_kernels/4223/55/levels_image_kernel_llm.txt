// Consider coalesced memory access for improved performance.
// Evaluate using shared memory to minimize global memory bandwidth.
// Optimize memory alignment to reduce misaligned memory transactions.
// Reduce divergent branching to enhance warp efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling for potential performance gains.
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data to improve caching efficiency.
// Evaluate compile-time constants to remove redundant calculations.
// Minimize global memory access by preloading data into registers.
