```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed values such as variance[f] and mean[f] to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to enhance performance when accessing x array with different index computations.
// Prefetch the data required for computations into registers to reduce latency.
// Utilize __restrict__ pointer qualifiers for input parameters to inform the compiler of non-aliasing pointers.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for the delta and x arrays to improve global memory throughput.
// Adjust block and thread configuration to maximize occupancy while considering register and shared memory usage.
