```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Aim to reduce shared memory bank conflicts and optimize cache usage.
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead if applicable.
// Consider using a larger block size to increase parallelism, while ensuring it does not exceed register limits.
// Ensure global memory writes are coalesced to improve throughput.
