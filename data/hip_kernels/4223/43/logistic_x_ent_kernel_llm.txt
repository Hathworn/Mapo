```
// Combine reads of pred[i] and truth[i] to coalesce memory accesses
// Use shared memory to store intermediate values if reused within the thread block
// Optimize memory access patterns for error[i] and delta[i] by ensuring coalesced writes
// Minimize register pressure by using fewer registers when possible
