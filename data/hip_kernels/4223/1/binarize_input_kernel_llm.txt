// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for input by ensuring coalesced access.
// Reduce the use of atomicAdd with better reduction techniques to minimize serialization.
// Explore implementing a warp-level reduction to optimize sharedMean calculation.
// Update synchronization strategy to enhance the efficiency of parallel reduction.
// Verify that shared memory usage is optimal and does not exceed per-block limits.
