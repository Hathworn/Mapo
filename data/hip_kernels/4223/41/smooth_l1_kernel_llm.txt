```cpp
// Use memory coalescing by accessing consecutive elements within a warp
// Minimize shared memory usage and try to fit data into L1 cache if applicable
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers for pred, truth, delta, and error for potential compiler optimizations
// Evaluate the possibility of using float4 or float2 types for vectorized loading and storing
// Ensure that data being read and written is aligned to avoid uncoalesced memory access penalties
// Investigate if precomputing common expressions can reduce redundant calculations within the loop
