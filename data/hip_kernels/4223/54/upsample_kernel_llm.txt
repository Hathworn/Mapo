// Consider using shared memory to store partial results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and utilization.
// Coalesce global memory access for read operations to improve memory bandwidth.
// Align memory access patterns to ensure optimal memory transaction size and avoid bank conflicts.
// Utilize constant memory for frequently used values like scale to decrease global memory latency.
