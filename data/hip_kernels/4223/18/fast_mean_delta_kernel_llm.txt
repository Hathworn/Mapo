```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for delta to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure enough shared memory is allocated to avoid conflicts and bank issues.
// Utilize __syncthreads() judiciously, as it is a barrier synchronization point.
// Optimize the loop to reduce warp divergence by ensuring all threads execute similar paths.
// Evaluate using warp-level primitives for reduction to increase parallelism.
// Explore reducing global memory accesses by storing invariants in registers when possible.
// Investigate using atomic operations if concurrent updates are possible or needed.
