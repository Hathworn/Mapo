```
// Consider optimizing memory access by using shared memory for X and Y within each block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the OUT array to improve global memory throughput.
// Minimize divergence by handling the X and Y assignments in separate kernel launches if possible.
// Check if launching fewer blocks with more threads per block improves occupancy and performance.
