```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input values to reduce global memory access.
// Pre-fetch input elements to registers to hide global memory latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for both input and output arrays.
// Check alignment and padding to ensure optimal memory access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling for the largest search and exponential computation loops.
// Use __expf for faster computation of the exponential function in the device.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy based on the specific GPU architecture.
