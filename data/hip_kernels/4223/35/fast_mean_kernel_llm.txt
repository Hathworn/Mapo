```
// Loop unrolling for better performance
// Access coalesced memory for x to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Use parallel reduction to utilize shared memory more effectively
// Favor shared memory for intermediate accumulation to reduce global memory pressure
// Ensure only necessary synchronization to minimize warp divergence
// Minimize number of synchronizations for better performance
