// Consider using shared memory to store ALPHA if accessed frequently by threads  
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring X is accessed in a contiguous manner  
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable to inform compiler of non-overlapping pointer accesses  
// Implement warp-level primitives to further reduce branch divergence  
// Analyze whether prefetching data or using asynchronous copies can benefit performance
