```c
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access where possible.
// Consider loading data into registers for variables that are repeatedly accessed.
// Ensure that the block size is set to maximize occupancy while adhering to the maximum blocks per multiprocessor.
