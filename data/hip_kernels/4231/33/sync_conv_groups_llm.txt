```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to maximize coalescing
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible
// Ensure all data fits into the available shared memory to prevent overflow
// Exploit data locality by grouping threads working on the same data
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance
// Profile kernel to identify any memory or synchronization bottlenecks
