```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads when accessing 'delta'.
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring conditionals efficiently.
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed iteration loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Prefetch data into registers before entering the critical loop to reduce latency.
