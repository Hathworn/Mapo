```
// Loop unrolling by processing 4 elements at once to increase memory throughput
// Initialize shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Use shared memory for partial sums to minimize global memory operations
// Perform reduction within the block by using shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have finished writing to shared memory
// Accumulate results using a single atomic operation at the end of kernel execution
