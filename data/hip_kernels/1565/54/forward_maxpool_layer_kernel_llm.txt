```
// Consider coalescing memory access for input to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that output and indexes are also accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Use shared memory to load input data tiles when accessing it multiple times.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses if shared memory is used.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for input pointers if appropriate.
// Ensure that the kernel is launched with optimal block and grid sizes.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for the size * size loop.
