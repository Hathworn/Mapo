```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch data to shared memory where possible
// Only load data into shared memory if the index is valid
// Use __syncthreads to ensure all threads synchronize after loading shared memory
// Reduce global memory transactions by checking index bounds before loading data
// Minimize memory divergence by using conditional statements smartly
```
