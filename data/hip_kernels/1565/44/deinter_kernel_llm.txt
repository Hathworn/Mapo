```
// Minimize thread divergence by using early exits instead of deeply nested conditionals.
// Consider loading repeated data into shared memory for reduced global memory access.
// Align memory accesses to coalesced memory transactions for improved throughput.
// Investigate whether combined loads and stores can be used to optimize bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure memory access patterns are stride-efficient to take advantage of L2 cache efficiently.
// Evaluate potential use of memory fences to ensure correct ordering of operations when necessary.
