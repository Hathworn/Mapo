// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if data access patterns allow
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Evaluate the impact of using shared memory if applicable
// Consider reducing memory access by using registers for temporary values
// Tune block and grid sizes to fully utilize the GPU
