```
// Precompute indices outside of the main loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring continuous memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to load data into faster, thread-accessible storage
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for X and Y to increase bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp efficiency
