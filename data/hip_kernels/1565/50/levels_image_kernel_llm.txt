```
// Ensure memory coalescing by processing consecutive threads on contiguous memory addresses
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Precompute constant expressions outside of the loop to improve performance
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by avoiding complex conditional statements
// Align memory accesses to improve memory access speed
