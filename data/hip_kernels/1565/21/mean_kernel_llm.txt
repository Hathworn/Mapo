// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory accesses.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the batch and spatial dimensions to improve performance.
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads to safely synchronize threads when accessing shared memory.
// Consider optimizing block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and parallelism.
