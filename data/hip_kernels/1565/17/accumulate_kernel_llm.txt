```
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring aligned accesses to the x array.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce access latency and optimize bandwidth.
// Consider warp-level parallel reduction for faster accumulation.
// Ensure shared memory is large enough to accommodate all threads in the block.
// Use atomic operations for global sum update if multiple blocks write to the same location.
