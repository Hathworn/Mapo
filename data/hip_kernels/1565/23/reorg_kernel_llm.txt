```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use memory coalescing to optimize memory access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for better parallelism
// Implement occupancy calculators for optimal block and grid sizes
// Avoid branch divergence with more uniform conditional logic
// Minimize register usage to allow higher occupancy
