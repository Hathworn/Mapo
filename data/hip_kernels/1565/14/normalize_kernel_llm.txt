```
// Consider preloading mean[f] and variance[f] into registers to reduce memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access by using coalesced memory access patterns for x.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path to the extent possible.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to achieve better occupancy and performance.
// Use shared memory if possible to cache frequently accessed data for faster compute.
