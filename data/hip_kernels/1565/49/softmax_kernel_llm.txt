```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction for finding the largest value
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance of tight loops
// Use texture memory if input data is read-only and benefits from caching
// Align memory accesses to increase coalesced memory transactions
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency where applicable
// Optimize thread block size based on occupancy calculator for best performance
