// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Ensure minimal divergence in control flow by structuring conditional checks effectively
// Allocate adequate number of threads per block to fully utilize hardware occupancy
// Tune block size to achieve better memory coalescing based on the dataset and hardware specifics
