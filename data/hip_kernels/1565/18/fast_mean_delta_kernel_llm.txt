```
// Consider coalesced memory access by reorganizing loops or data layout.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to prevent potential aliasing.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory latency.
// Optimize boundary check logic to minimize instructions within the loop.
// Evaluate the usage of float vs double to balance precision and performance.
// Explore the potential for loop unrolling to improve throughput.
// Review shared memory bank conflicts to ensure optimal usage.
// Assess usage of atomic operations if shared memory reduction changes.
