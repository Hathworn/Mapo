```
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated accesses to nearby memory locations.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to improve global memory throughput.
// Test different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for your specific hardware.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
