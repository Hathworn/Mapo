```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for common calculations.
// Use loop unrolling techniques if possible for further performance improvement.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced accesses for x, m, and v arrays.
// Introduce constant memory for variables like B1, B2, rate, and eps if they are constant across kernels.
