```
// Unroll nested loops to reduce loop control overhead
// Use shared memory to cache repeated access data_im for better memory access speed
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring continuous memory access pattern for data_col_ptr
// Consider maximizing block size to improve GPU occupancy and parallelism
// Reduce bank conflicts by padding shared memory if used
// Minimize branching by restructuring conditional checks for data assignment
