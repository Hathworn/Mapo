// Use shared memory for parallel reduction to find max value.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced to improve read performance.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory operations.
// Use atomic operations efficiently to prevent race conditions during summation.
// Allocate only necessary shared memory to reduce shared memory usage.
