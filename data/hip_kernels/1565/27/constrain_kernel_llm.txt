```
// Consider using shared memory if there's reuse in values to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring X[i * INCX] accesses are aligned
// Evaluate the potential benefits of loop unrolling for the critical section
// Check for occupancy and adjust block size to make full use of the hardware
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if possible to aid the compiler in optimization
