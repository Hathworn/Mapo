// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if data reuse is possible  
// Ensure coalesced memory access by analyzing INCX and INCY for optimal stride values  
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning INCX and INCY to warp boundaries  
// Launch kernel with adequate compute-to-memory ratio to maximize bandwidth utilization  
// Consider loop unrolling for the grid-stride loop to reduce loop overhead  
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better load balancing and occupancy
