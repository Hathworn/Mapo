// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for input matrices.
// Tile matrix multiplication to minimize data movement.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by using shared memory buffers.
// __syncthreads() must be called after loading shared memory to ensure all threads have completed.
// Check bounds before accessing shared memory to avoid unnecessary memory operations.
