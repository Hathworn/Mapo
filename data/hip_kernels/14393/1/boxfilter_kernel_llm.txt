// Consider using shared memory for tile caching to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to minimize loop overhead.
// Investigate the use of texture memory for improved read performance on source image data.
// Ensure optimal block size for better occupancy by balancing between compute and memory resources.
// Consider using asynchronous copies and prefetching techniques to overlap computation and memory transfer.
