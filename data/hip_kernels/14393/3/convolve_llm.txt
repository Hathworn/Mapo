```cpp
// Consider using texture memory for source data to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure sharedKernel is fully loaded by all threads before synchronization
// Minimize global memory accesses by accessing coalesced data
// Utilize warp shuffling techniques to eliminate shared memory usage when possible
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Ensure grid and block dimensions match the image size for optimal usage
