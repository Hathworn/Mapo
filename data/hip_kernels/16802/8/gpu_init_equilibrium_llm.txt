```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth utilization.
// Align data structures to increase memory throughput.
// Use read-only cache for constant data to reduce memory bandwidth pressure.
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize warp divergence.
