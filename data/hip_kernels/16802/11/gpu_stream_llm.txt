```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Consider data prefetching to improve memory access patterns.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Look into using textures for constant memory access if applicable.
// Evaluate use of half precision to reduce memory bandwidth demand.
