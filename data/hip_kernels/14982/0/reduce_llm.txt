```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Leverage loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and enhance throughput
// Use grid-stride loop to maximize data usage from global memory
// Employ warp-level primitives to optimize intra-block communication and reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing contiguous elements in global memory
