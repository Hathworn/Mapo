```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access for elements accessed multiple times.
// Consider loop unrolling if the operation within if statement can be predicted.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by verifying the alignment of the vector in memory.
// Use pinned memory for input/output vectors to increase data transfer speed between host and device.
