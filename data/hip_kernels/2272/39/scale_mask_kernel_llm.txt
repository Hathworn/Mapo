```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to maximize global memory throughput
// Evaluate if shared memory usage could benefit repetitive access to the mask array
// Pay attention to avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory if used
