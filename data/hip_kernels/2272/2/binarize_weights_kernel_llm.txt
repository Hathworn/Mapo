```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for weights and binary arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize asynchronous memory copies where possible to hide data transfer latency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring no bank conflicts for shared_mean.
// Try employing warp-level primitives for reduction instead of shared memory to optimize parallelism.
// Evaluate the effect of different block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
