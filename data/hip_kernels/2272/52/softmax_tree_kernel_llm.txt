// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access for group_offset and group_size
// Consider loop unrolling for softmax_device calculations to enhance performance
// Align memory accesses to natural vector sizes for better coalescing
// Minimize arithmetic operations by storing intermediate results when possible
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize bandwidth utilization
