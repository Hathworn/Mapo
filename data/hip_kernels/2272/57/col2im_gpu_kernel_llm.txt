```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for data_col to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure proper alignment of data to exploit efficient memory transactions.
// Analyze occupancy to determine if increasing block size could improve performance.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifiers to aid compiler optimizations.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergent branches inside loops.
// Assess if loop unrolling provides significant performance benefits in this context.
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap data transfer with computations.
