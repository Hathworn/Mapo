```c
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch data to registers for reuse within the loop
// Consider using texture memory for better memory access patterns with read-only data
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce access latency
// Optimize block and grid size configuration for maximum warp utilization
