```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing delta with a contiguous pattern per thread
// Consider utilizing warp shuffle operations to efficiently reduce tmp across threads
// Use __syncthreads() after accumulation if using shared memory for correctness
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring padding if necessary
// Improve scaling factor calculation to reduce redundant computations
```
