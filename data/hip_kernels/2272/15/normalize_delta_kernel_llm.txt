// Consider using shared memory to cache 'variance[f]' and 'mean[f]' within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Explore cooperative thread synchronization to maximize memory bandwidth and minimize bank conflicts.
// Investigate coalesced memory access patterns for 'delta' and 'x' to improve memory throughput.
