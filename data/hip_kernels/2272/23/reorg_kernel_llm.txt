```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to improve efficiency
// Ensure memory access is aligned to prevent bank conflicts
// Reduce the number of divergent branches to maximize warp execution efficiency
// Exploit memory access locality by optimizing access patterns
