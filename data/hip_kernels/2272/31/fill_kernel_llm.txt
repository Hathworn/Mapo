```
// Consider using coalesced memory access by ensuring X is accessed in a linear stride
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and warp execution efficiency
// Minimize data transfer between device and host by keeping computations on the device
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
