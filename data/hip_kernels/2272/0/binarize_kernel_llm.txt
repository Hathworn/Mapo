```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve throughput
// Align data accesses to match memory transaction size
// Use vectorized memory operations for better efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
