```
// Use shared memory to cache image data per block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalescing accesses to global memory, especially when reading `rand` and writing `image`.
// Optimize the thread indexing to better utilize warps and reduce divergence.
// Minimize redundant calculations within the kernel, such as repeated calculations of offsets.
// Consider using texture memory if image data access patterns are suitable for caching.
