```cpp
// Consider coalesced access by aligning data structure to warp size
// Optimize memory access patterns through shared memory usage
// Minimize usage of atomic operations if possible, or use finer granularity
// Pre-calculate stride as a constant outside the loop for optimization
// Ensure appropriate grid and block size to maximize occupancy and minimize divergence
