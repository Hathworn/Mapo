```
// Consider memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure that INCX is set to 1 to maintain coalesced accesses when possible
// Use shared memory if data reuse is expected within the block
// Profile the impact of varying block and grid sizes to optimize performance
// Minimize memory divergence across threads in a warp
