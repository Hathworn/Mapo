// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by accessing consecutive elements
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Use vectorized memory accesses if possible to process multiple data elements simultaneously
// Verify if using half precision (FP16) can be beneficial for calculations to increase throughput
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
