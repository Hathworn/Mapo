```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads and writes to global memory
// Balance the workload by maximizing thread utilization across blocks
// Make full use of shared memory if applicable for intermediate data storage
// Minimize branch divergence inside the kernel for better performance
// Consider using a larger block size to improve throughput if resource usage allows
// Align INCX and INCY with warp size to optimize memory transactions
