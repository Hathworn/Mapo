```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache data_im and reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that data each thread pulls in is contiguous in global memory.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for data_im and data_col to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate whether using the constant memory space for frequently accessed static values like ksize, pad, and stride may yield performance benefits.
