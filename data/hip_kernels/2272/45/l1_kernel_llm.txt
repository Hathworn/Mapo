```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring data is accessed coalesced
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// If possible, prefetch data to registers to minimize memory access latency
// Ensure memory alignment to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Use constant memory if 'truth' and 'pred' are read-only and static in the context
