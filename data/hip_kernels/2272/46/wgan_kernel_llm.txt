// Cache pred[i] and truth[i] to reduce global memory accesses
// Use shared memory if possible to optimize memory bandwidth
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Adjust block and grid sizes for better occupancy and performance
// Consider using texture memory for frequently accessed data
