```
// Precompute the scale factor outside the inner loops to reduce redundant calculations.
// Capture the global thread index in a separate variable for clarity and potential reuse.
// Return early if the current thread index exceeds the number of filters.
// Use local variables (registers) for intermediate calculations to minimize memory access.
// Avoid recalculating the index multiple times within nested loops by computing it once.
// Compute the difference between input and mean only once to save computational resources.
// Replace powf with multiplication as a more efficient operation for squaring differences.
