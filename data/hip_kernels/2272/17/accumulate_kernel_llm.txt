// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize thread block size to match warp size and maximize occupancy
// Consider using shared memory if intermediate data can be reused by threads in the same block
// Ensure grid and block dimensions effectively cover all execution paths
