```
// Use shared memory to buffer input data and reduce global memory reads
// Limit thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Optimize for L1 cache utilization by organizing data and threads efficiently
// Use vectorized operations if possible to load/store multiple elements at once
