```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for delta and indexes arrays.
// Try using texture memory for data with spatial locality.
// Optimize loop structure to improve warp utilization.
// Reduce branch divergence inside the pooling area loop.
// Apply loop unrolling for better performance.
