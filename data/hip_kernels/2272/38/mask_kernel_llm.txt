```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses across threads.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage if implemented.
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions based on the GPU architecture.
// Pre-fetch mask[i] value to reduce accesses within the loop.
// Use __syncthreads() if necessary to prevent race conditions.
