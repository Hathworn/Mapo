```
// Use shared memory to store partial sums for faster access
// Perform loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for delta
// Implement optimized reduction using hierarchical parallel sum
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() by merging reduction steps
// Use warp-level operations to minimize synchronization overhead
```
