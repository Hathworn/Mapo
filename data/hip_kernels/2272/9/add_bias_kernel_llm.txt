```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory throughput
// Investigate the possibility of using warp-level operations for better occupancy and efficiency
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage if implemented
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable compiler optimizations
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to minimize loop overhead
