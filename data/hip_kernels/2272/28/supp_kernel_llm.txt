```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring INCX is 1
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring that the conditional branch is optimized
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if multiple threads access similar data
// Prefetch data to registers before processing to reduce memory latency
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are optimized for maximum occupancy
