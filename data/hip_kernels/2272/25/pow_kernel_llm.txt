// Consider using shared memory to store the input array 'X' if multiple threads access nearby elements.
// Use warp-level operations to minimize divergence and improve memory access patterns.
// Ensure 'X' and 'Y' are aligned and padded to optimize memory coalescing.
// Investigate if using a larger thread block size could enhance performance by increasing occupancy.
// Profile the kernel execution to identify potential latency hiding opportunities.
