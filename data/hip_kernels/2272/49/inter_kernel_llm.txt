```
// Consider using shared memory to cache X and Y values for better memory access patterns
// Ensure memory coalescing by adjusting thread access patterns to contiguous memory locations
// Use __restrict__ keyword with pointers to help compiler with aliasing optimizations
// Evaluate warp optimization techniques for better utilization of GPU cores
// Profile cache usage with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration
