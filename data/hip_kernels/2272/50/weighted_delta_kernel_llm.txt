// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve cache utilization.
// Analyze warp divergence for potential optimization opportunities.
// Ensure grid stride loop is used efficiently with appropriate grid and block dimensions.
