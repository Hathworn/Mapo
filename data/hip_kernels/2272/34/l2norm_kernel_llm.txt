// Optimize memory access by ensuring 'x' and 'dx' arrays are coalesced.
// Use shared memory to store partial sums for improved memory efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling within inner loops for 'filters' to enhance performance.
// Evaluate the use of float2 or float4 to process 'x' and 'dx' for better throughput.
// Use atomic operations if necessary to avoid race conditions with shared sums.
