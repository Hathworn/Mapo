```
// Ensure data is accessed in a coalesced manner to optimize memory reads
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries if possible for improved bandwidth
// Favor using shared memory for repeated access to improve access latency
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency where applicable
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution to enhance performance
