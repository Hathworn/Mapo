```
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput
// Use atomic operations for shared memory reductions to handle concurrent updates safely
// Minimize synchronization overhead by using __syncthreads() only when necessary
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
