```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Ensure that 'rand' and 'input' arrays are aligned and occupying a single memory block
// Use shared memory if there are predictable reuse patterns in a warp
// Minimize divergent branches within warps for better performance
