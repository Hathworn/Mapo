```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by arranging data appropriately in memory.
// Minimize divergent branching in the kernel for better performance.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling or other techniques could improve performance.
// Verify block and grid size configuration for optimal occupancy.
