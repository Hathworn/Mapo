```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when accessing a and b for improved memory throughput.
// Consider adjusting the block size based on the GPU architecture for optimal performance.
// Minimize global memory accesses by keeping intermediate results in shared memory.
// Ensure that the loop unrolling factors are suitable for the targeted GPU architecture.
