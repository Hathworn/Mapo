```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by using contiguous threads to access contiguous memory addresses in src
// Optimize for memory alignment by ensuring src and tgt arrays are aligned to suitable boundaries
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data from src to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring accesses are spread across multiple memory banks
