```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring state array is accessed by contiguous threads
// Use __restrict__ keyword if state array is not aliased to improve compiler optimization
// Prefetch data to shared memory if multiple accesses are needed by threads based on further requirements
// Align memory allocations to cache line size for better memory throughput if applicable
