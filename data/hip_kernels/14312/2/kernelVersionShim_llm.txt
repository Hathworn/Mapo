```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve the throughput
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning memory access patterns
// Avoid unnecessary global memory transactions by reusing data in registers
// Utilize async memory copies to overlap data transfer and computation
