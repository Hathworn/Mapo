```
// Consider aligning memory access patterns for coalesced memory access
// Ensure that memory accesses are sequential to exploit memory coalescing
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for increased memory bandwidth utilization
