```
// Consider using a larger portion of shared memory to increase data locality
// Load data from global memory to shared memory in a coalesced manner to optimize bandwidth
// Use multiple thread blocks to increase parallelism and hide memory latency
// Reduce synchronization by minimizing dependencies between threads
// Utilize more registers for thread-specific computations to improve performance
// Ensure the loop count is properly set according to workload specifics for better resource utilization
// Store results back to global memory using coalesced writes to improve performance
