// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads
// Consider using loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Handle boundary cases to avoid out-of-bounds access
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Synchronize threads to ensure data consistency
// Reduce computation by exploiting parallelism
