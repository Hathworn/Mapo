```
// Consider using shared memory to load input data for better memory coalescing
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring all accesses are coalesced
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Explore the use of mixed precision if applicable for further optimization
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and performance
