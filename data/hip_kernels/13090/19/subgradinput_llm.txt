```
// Use shared memory to cache parts of gradOutput for reduced global memory access
// Leverage memory coalescing by aligning data accesses to avoid memory bank conflicts
// Implement loop blocking or tiling for improved cache utilization
// Consider reducing the number of index computations inside the loops
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing variable usage within compute-intensive loops
