```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data to memory boundaries
// Minimize bank conflicts by optimizing thread access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth consumption
// Unroll the loops further if possible to improve instruction throughput
// Evaluate potential benefits of warp-level primitives to reduce atomic contention
