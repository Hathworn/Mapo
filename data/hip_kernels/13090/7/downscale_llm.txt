```
// Improve memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a coalesced pattern.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant loading from global memory.
// Consider double buffering if shared memory is used to hide latency.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditional statements.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve performance.
// Unrolling loops can be complemented with prefetching data to registers.
// Consider reducing bank conflicts in shared memory by rearranging data.
