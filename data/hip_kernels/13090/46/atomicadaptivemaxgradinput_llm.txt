```
// Use shared memory to store reusable data and reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce memory accesses by aligning threads with consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve access speed.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations where possible due to potential contention and delays.
// Consider loop unrolling for smaller loop trip counts to reduce loop overhead.
// Use vectorized memory operations for memory reads/writes where data layout allows.
