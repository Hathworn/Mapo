// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for gradOutput[] and gradWeight[] for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Avoid branching within the critical loop and use predicated memory accesses where possible for efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loops to improve instruction throughput.
// Optimize memory usage by leveraging shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Use atomic operations when updating gradWeight to prevent race conditions in parallel updates.
