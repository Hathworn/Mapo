```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for gradOutput to improve bandwidth efficiency.
// Ensure that gradInput and gradOutput are aligned for coalesced access patterns.
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring gradInput accesses are aligned across threads.
// Consider prefetching weights to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use double buffering for ptr_gradOutput to hide memory access latency.
// Optimize loop unrolling for the inner loops iterating over kH and kW for better performance.
// Consider reordering thread assignments to better fit access patterns and hit cache lines.
