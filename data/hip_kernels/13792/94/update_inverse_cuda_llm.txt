```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure threads in a block are synchronized using __syncthreads().
// Leverage shared memory to store intermediate results for A_k.
// Perform reduction in shared memory to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Minimize global memory writes by batched updates using shared memory.
// Reduce the number of syncthreads within loops to minimize overhead.
// Ensure data loading into shared memory is coalesced.
