```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Conditional assignment prevents out-of-bounds memory access
// Minimize divergent branches within warp by conditional logic
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory operations are complete
// Use loop unrolling if possible for further optimization
