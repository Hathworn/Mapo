```
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern within the kernel.
// Consider storing intermediate results to shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize nested loops to minimize branch divergence.
// Unroll inner loops, if possible, to increase performance.
// Minimize usage of global memory by utilizing registers where appropriate.
// Align memory accesses to benefit from memory coalescing.
