```
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated global memory access to minimize latency.
// Use vectorized memory loads and stores where possible for coalesced access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Assess the occupancy and launch parameters to potentially improve parallelism.
