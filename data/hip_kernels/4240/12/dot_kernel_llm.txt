```
// Consider using shared memory for caching output[i1] and output[i2] for faster access.
// Explore loop unrolling in the inner loop to enhance performance.
// Precompute indices outside loops where possible to reduce redundant calculations.
// Check if block and thread configuration can be further optimized for warp efficiency.
// Use atomic operations if necessary to prevent race conditions.
