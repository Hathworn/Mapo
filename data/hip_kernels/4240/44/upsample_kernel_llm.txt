```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using loop unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Employ coalesced memory accesses by arranging data in memory to match the pattern of thread access
// Explore using asynchronous memory prefetching to hide the latency of global memory accesses
// Optimize stride value to ensure contiguous memory access patterns and reduce memory transaction overhead
