```
// Precompute constants outside of loop to reduce redundant calculations.
// Compute global thread index for efficient parallel execution.
// Check boundary conditions early to minimize unnecessary computations.
// Unroll loops to enhance parallel performance by increasing instruction-level parallelism.
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring access patterns are well-distributed among threads.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory bottlenecks.
