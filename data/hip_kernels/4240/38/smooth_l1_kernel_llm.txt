// Consider using shared memory to load inputs for memory access optimization
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to help with memory access speedup
// Unroll loops if possible for further optimization in larger grids
// Align data accesses to 128 bytes boundary for coalesced access in global memory
// Evaluate the use of inline functions for math operations to reduce function call overhead
