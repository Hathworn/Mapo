```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input[] to improve memory access patterns
// Use shared memory for intermediate computations in softmax_device to reduce global memory access
// Ensure input and output pointers are aligned properly for efficient memory transactions
// Optimize register usage by ensuring variables are efficiently managed and accessed
// Evaluate the possibility of using more threads per block to hide memory latency effectively
// Minimize control divergence by ensuring threads in the same warp follow the same execution path
