```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for input data.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize accessing the global memory inside the loops.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting the data layout if necessary.
// Use warp-level primitives to avoid thread divergence in the inner loops.
// Unroll the inner loops for potential better performance on architectures that support it.
// Check if loop bounds can be optimized further for reducing register pressure.
