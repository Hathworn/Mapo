```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse occurs across threads 
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned with warp boundaries for better coalescing
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path 
// Optimize data transfer between host and device where applicable
