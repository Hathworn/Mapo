```
// Use shared memory for mean_delta initialization to improve memory access speeds
// Employ atomicAdd to avoid race conditions in shared memory updates
// Consider unrolling loops to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead
// Ensure mean_delta computation is finalized after synchronization to maintain correctness
