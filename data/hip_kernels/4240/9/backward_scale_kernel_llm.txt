// Consider memory coalescing to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses
// Employ loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Optimize reduction operations by minimizing synchronization overhead
// Reduce atomic operations to avoid performance bottlenecks
