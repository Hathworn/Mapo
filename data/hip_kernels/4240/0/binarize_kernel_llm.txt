```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop body is more complex
// Profile the kernel to identify if memory or compute bound for further optimization
// Assess register usage to ensure efficient occupancy
