```cpp
// Allocate shared memory dynamically based on block size and thread usage
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory to store data temporarily
// Pre-calculate index expressions to avoid redundant calculations within the loop
// Use shared memory to store input values that can be reused by multiple threads
// Reduce divergent branching by minimizing conditional statements within the kernel
```
