```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data within the block for better memory coalescing.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data and using sequential thread access patterns.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for this specific hardware.
// Use loop unrolling pragmas appropriately to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction parallelism.
// Profile the kernel to identify any potential bottlenecks in memory access or computation.
