// Consider replacing the division operation in the global kernel with a precomputed value outside the kernel to reduce computational overhead.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant memory accesses for input values.
// Optimize thread and block dimension configuration for better utilization of GPU hardware.
// Minimize conditional checks inside the kernel for performance improvement.
// Use memory coalescing techniques to access input and output arrays sequentially in global memory.
