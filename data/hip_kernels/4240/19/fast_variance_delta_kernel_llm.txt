```
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming for reduction within shared memory.
// Use loop unrolling techniques for the inner loop to improve performance.
// Avoid redundant computation by moving variance_factor calculation outside of the loop.
// Ensure the use of coalesced memory access patterns for the `x`, `delta`, and `mean` arrays.
// Implement occupancy check to maximize GPU utilization and optimize thread/block configuration.
