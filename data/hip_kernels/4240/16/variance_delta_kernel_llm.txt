// Consider using shared memory to optimize access to variables like `mean[i]` and `variance[i]`.
// Avoid redundant calculations by precomputing `variance[i] + .000001f` before the loop.
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing reads and writes where possible.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for the nested loops to reduce overhead.
