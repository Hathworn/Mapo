```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Utilize vectorized memory loads and stores if possible for better memory efficiency
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide global memory latency
// Ensure global memory accesses are aligned for improved performance
// Limit divergent branches to keep all threads in a warp on the same execution path
// Optimize shared memory usage to fit within hardware limitations for best performance
