// Increase blockDim.x to maximize occupancy and match shared memory size.
// Use shared memory for intermediate values to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using warp intrinsics for reduction to optimize shared memory bandwidth.
// Reduce the number of threads if shared memory usage is too high.
