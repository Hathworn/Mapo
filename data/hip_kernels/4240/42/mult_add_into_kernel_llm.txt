// Consider using coalesced memory access to improve throughput
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Use loop unrolling for repeated operations to decrease overhead
// Ensure __syncthreads() is called appropriately to synchronize threads
// Check if reducing grid and block dimensions can improve efficiency
