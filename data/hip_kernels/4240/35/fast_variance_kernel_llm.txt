```
// Consider coalescing memory access for the input array 'x'
// Use shared memory to cache mean[filter] to optimize its access
// Implement loop unrolling for the outer loop to increase performance
// Strive to optimize the parallel reduction by using shuffle operations if supported
// Employ warp-level primitives for more efficient synchronization and reduction
// Minimize the number of branching operations within threads
