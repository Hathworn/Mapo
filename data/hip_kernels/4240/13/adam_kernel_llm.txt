```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory addresses
// Use shared memory or registers to store repeated accessed values to reduce global memory access
// Consider using vectorized operations to optimize memory transactions on supported hardware
// Precompute and store constant values in registers to minimize recalculation overhead
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations by combining them where possible
