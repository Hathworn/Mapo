// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Balance workload across threads to improve memory coalescing
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overheads
// Use 'restrict' keyword in pointer declarations to hint non-aliasing
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed available resources per block
