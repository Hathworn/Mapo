```
// Consider using shared memory for the input array to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use warp-level parallelism to accumulate mean values more efficiently.
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring that they are coalesced.
// Consider leveraging vectorized operations if supported by the hardware to improve throughput.
// Minimize branching by using ternary operators or intrinsic functions to handle binarization.
