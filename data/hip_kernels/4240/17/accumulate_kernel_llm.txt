// Consider coalescing global memory accesses when reading input data
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded their portion into shared memory
// Optimize shared memory usage by adjusting block and grid dimensions
// Avoid excessive synchronization to reduce potential performance bottlenecks
