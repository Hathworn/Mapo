```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed variables.
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Minimize divergent branches inside the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for any repetitive operations to reduce instruction overhead.
// Verify occupancy and try optimizing the number of threads per block to maximize hardware utilization.
