// Use shared memory to store p_Temp values for faster access by threads within the same block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when reading/writing from/to global memory.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditions where possible.
// Explore loop unrolling for potential performance gains in repetitive calculations.
