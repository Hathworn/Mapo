```
// Consider coalesced memory access for p_Input and p_Output to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory alignment to optimize memory access patterns.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads within a warp take the same execution path.
