```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access in the kernel.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant calculations and improve performance.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to hint the compiler about no aliasing.
// Minimize the number of operations within the if condition for efficiency.
// Explore loop unrolling strategies for repeated operations.
// Try reducing precision where possible to optimize throughput.
// Ensure enough occupancy by tuning block size and memory usage appropriately.
