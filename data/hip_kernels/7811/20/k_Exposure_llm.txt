// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data reuse
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and parallelism
// Pre-fetch data into registers to minimize repeated global memory access
