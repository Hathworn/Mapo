```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory fetches.
// Optimize conditional statements to reduce branch divergence.
// Minimize use of modulo operation within loops for better performance.
// Align memory accesses according to warp size for better efficiency.
