// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure aligned memory accesses to take advantage of memory coalescing.
// Optimize thread occupancy by choosing appropriate block size and grid size.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to leverage caching benefits.
