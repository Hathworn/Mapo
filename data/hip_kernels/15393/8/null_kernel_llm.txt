```
// Use __shared__ memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement if there are loops in the kernel.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to avoid misaligned accesses.
