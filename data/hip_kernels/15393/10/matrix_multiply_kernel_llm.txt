```
// Use coalesced memory access for matrix to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider using double buffering in shared memory to hide latency and improve throughput
// Optimize block size to ensure maximum occupancy and minimize idle threads
// Minimize the size of shared memory to fit more blocks per multiprocessor
// Implement loop unrolling for the matrix-vector multiplication loop to reduce loop overhead
// Profile kernel execution to find the optimal number of threads per block
