```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure thread block size is optimal for shared memory utilization
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when loading from global to shared memory
// Reduce bank conflicts within shared memory by padding if necessary
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded their data before computation
