```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure use of shared memory to minimize global memory accesses where possible.
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling for the innermost loops.
// Reduce conditional statements inside the kernel to improve execution efficiency.
// Investigate the alignment of memory to take advantage of faster memory accesses.
// Analyze warp divergence and ensure threads within a warp follow a similar execution path.
