```
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling to enhance memory coalescing
// Ensure all threads complete their memory writes with __syncthreads()
// Implement warp-shuffle reduction for further optimization if possible
// Optimize for occupancy by carefully choosing DP_BLOCKSIZE
```
