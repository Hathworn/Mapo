// Precompute the global thread index to reduce repeated calculations
// Check thread indices against bounds early to minimize unnecessary computations
// Use precomputed indices for memory access to improve memory coalescence
// Prefetch data when calculating vector index base to increase cache efficiency
// Optimize printf for conditional execution if possible, as printing can be costly in global kernels
