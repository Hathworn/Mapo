// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for gradInput_data to improve performance.
// Investigate using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling for scale_factor loop to reduce overhead.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to optimize pointer usage.
// Analyze warp level parallelism for shared memory utilization.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimal for hardware capabilities.
// Evaluate potential use of half precision for reducing memory bandwidth.
