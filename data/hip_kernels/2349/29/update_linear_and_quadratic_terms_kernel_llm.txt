```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for cur_tot_weight
// Reduce atomic operations by accumulating results in registers before updating quadratic
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance in the loop processing
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data access to cache lines
// Reduce latency by minimizing conditional statements within the loop
