```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for optimal global memory throughput.
// Leverage shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Align the data access patterns to memory boundaries for better performance.
// Utilize vectorized data types for loading and storing complex numbers.
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp to ensure all threads follow the same execution path.
// Consider using parallel reductions for any global summation or accumulation tasks.
