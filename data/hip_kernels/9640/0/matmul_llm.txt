// Consider unrolling the loop to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure using shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Optimize shared memory loading patterns to maximize coalesced access.
// Assess the use of __syncthreads() to determine if all are necessary, reducing barriers where possible.
// Evaluate using local memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce shared memory pressure.
