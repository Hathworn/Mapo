```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache inputs for better memory access patterns
// Avoid unnecessary data transfers between global and shared memory
// Check if loop unrolling could benefit more complex operations
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for improved performance
// Minimize use of conditional statements inside kernel if possible
```
