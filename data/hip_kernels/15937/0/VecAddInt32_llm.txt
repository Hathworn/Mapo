```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for global memory loads
// Ensure shared memory usage is beneficial, as it can introduce overhead
// Evaluate if prefetching data into shared memory offers performance gain
// Consider tiling or loop unrolling for large-scale operations
// Assess if warp-level primitives can enhance parallel efficiency
