```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing data with a pattern aligned with warp size
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to help the compiler with memory access optimizations
// Consider using __syncthreads() where necessary to prevent race conditions
// Ensure grid and block sizes are optimized for the specific GPU architecture
// Align data allocations to improve global memory bandwidth
// Explore loop unrolling to increase ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
