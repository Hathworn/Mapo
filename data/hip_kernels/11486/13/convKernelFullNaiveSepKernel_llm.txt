// Consider using shared memory to increase memory access speed and reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize memory coalescing patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Take advantage of texture memory for read-only input data to minimize latency
// Explore loop unrolling for the two nested loops to enhance performance by reducing loop control overhead
