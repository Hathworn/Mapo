```
// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays a, b, and c
// Ensure a, b, and c are aligned to improve memory access efficiency
// Optimize block and grid size for better occupancy and performance
// Use shared memory if frequent access of same data by multiple threads
// Ensure data resides in lower latency memory spaces to improve speed
