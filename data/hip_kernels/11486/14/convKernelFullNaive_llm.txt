```
// Use shared memory to cache portions of d_Input for coalesced memory access
// Preload d_Kernel into constant memory to reduce memory access latency
// Employ loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and improve performance
// Optimize memory coalescing for d_Output writing by ensuring aligned access
