```
// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays a, b, and c
// Ensure that data types are properly aligned to avoid misaligned accesses
// Utilize shared memory if frequent access to specific data elements is needed
// Explore vectorized operations if the compiler and hardware support such operations
// Minimize the use of global memory by maximizing the use of registers and shared memory
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance on the target GPU
