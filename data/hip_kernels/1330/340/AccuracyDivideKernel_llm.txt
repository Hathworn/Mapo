// Ensure the kernel is launched with only one block to minimize warp divergence.
// Consider loading 'accuracy' into a register before the division for faster access.
// Make sure 'accuracy' is not accessed by other operations in parallel to avoid race conditions.
// Evaluate if using hipMemcpy for transferring 'accuracy' between host and device is optimal.
