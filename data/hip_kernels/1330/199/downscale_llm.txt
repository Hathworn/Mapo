```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to improve cache utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses where possible.
// Ensure memory accesses follow a stride-1 pattern for better performance.
// Consider prefetching data to avoid memory stalls.
// Modify loop unrolling factors to suit the architecture and data size for better performance.
// Reduce divergent branches in the kernel to maximize warp efficiency.
