```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize the use of global memory within the kernel.
// Optimize the block and grid dimensions to maximize GPU occupancy.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for better performance.
// Implement loop unrolling for computational loops if applicable.
// Investigate the use of asynchronous memory operations to hide memory latency.
