```
// Improve memory access patterns to increase coalescence.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize the pointer arithmetic to avoid unnecessary calculations.
// Unroll loops to reduce the overhead of loop control.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to prevent performance penalties.
