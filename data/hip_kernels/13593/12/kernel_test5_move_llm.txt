```
// Consider coalesced memory access for global memory reads and writes
// Minimize redundant synchronization calls for improved performance
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring aligned access
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency
// Align data structures to avoid misaligned memory access penalties
