```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory performance.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access if data is reused among threads.
// Ensure memory alignment to prevent access penalties.
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize device occupancy.
// Minimize conditional statements within the device code for better performance.
// Ensure that the launch configuration is optimized for hardware capabilities.
