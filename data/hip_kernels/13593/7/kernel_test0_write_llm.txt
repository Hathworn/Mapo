```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within a block is high
// Minimize memory bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Optimize pattern and mask updates using compound assignment to reduce instruction count
// Skip redundant operations when specific conditions are met
// Align data structures to natural boundaries to improve access speed
