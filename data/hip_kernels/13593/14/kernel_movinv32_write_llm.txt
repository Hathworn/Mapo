```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning pointer arithmetic to memory boundaries.
// Reduce memory divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths.
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory if there is data reuse within the block.
// Optimize the use of registers to avoid spilling into local memory.
// Maintain proper memory access patterns by aligning data sizes to naturally cache line sizes.
