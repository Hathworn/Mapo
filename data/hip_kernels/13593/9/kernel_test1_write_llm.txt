```cpp
// Consider coalesced access to global memory for better memory throughput
// Ensure ptr is aligned with cache line boundaries to optimize memory transactions
// Reduce pointer casting overhead by directly working with char or specific datatype
// Use shared memory to hold intermediate results if needed
```
