```
// Consider preloading data into shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access
// Apply loop unrolling if there are repetitive patterns to minimize instruction overhead
// Use warp shuffle instructions for data sharing among threads in a warp for efficiency
// Evaluate using occupancy calculator to achieve maximum concurrency and hardware utilization
