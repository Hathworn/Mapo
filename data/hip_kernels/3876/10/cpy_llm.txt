```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for efficiency
// Consider using warp shuffle or reduce within a warp for faster reductions
// Use atomic operations judiciously as they may serialize memory updates
// Explore using multiple streams to overlap memory transfers and kernel execution
// Investigate aligning shared memory size to a multiple of warp size for optimal usage
