```
// Use reciprocal instead of division to improve performance by avoiding repeated division operations
// Optimize the loop stride to enhance memory access patterns and increase parallelism
// Pre-calculate values shared across threads to minimize redundant computations and memory accesses
// Perform updates in the loop using diagonal index calculation to ensure efficient memory access to quadratic array
// Manage atomic operations separately to avoid potential race conditions in the linear array update
