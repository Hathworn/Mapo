```
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Utilize float2 to minimize memory transactions
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently allocated to avoid bank conflicts
// Pre-compute indices for memory access to reduce arithmetic operations
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to prevent unnecessary synchronization
