```
// Use shared memory to cache data if possible to minimize global memory access
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches by reducing the complexity of conditional statements
// Explore the use of loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in the main loop
// Attempt to launch the kernel with an optimal block size for better performance
// Ensure memory allocations are aligned and properly managed for optimal access patterns
