```
// Consider coalesced memory access for lifter_coeffs to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Evaluate using shared memory for lifter_coeffs to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure that the lifter coefficients are pre-fetched and reside in L1 cache for faster access.
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads() to minimize unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Consider unrolling the loop for lifter coefficient application to improve instruction throughput.
// Use of threadIdx.x should ensure optimal per-thread workload distribution.
// Ensure memory alignment for float arrays to facilitate efficient memory transactions.
// Evaluate if combined loops or fused operations can further reduce kernel execution time.
