// Consider coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate use of shared memory for row-wise and column-wise operations
// Check alignment to improve memory access speed
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads follow identical paths
