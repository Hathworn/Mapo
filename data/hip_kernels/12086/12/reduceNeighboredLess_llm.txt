```
// Consider aligning shared memory usage with warp size for better coalescing
// Minimize the boundary check by using if (idx < n) at the beginning
// Use only what is necessary in shared memory to reduce allocation size
// Try to use atomic operations where possible for performance improvement
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance
