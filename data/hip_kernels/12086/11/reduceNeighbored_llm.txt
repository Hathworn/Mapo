```
// Consider using warp-level primitives to avoid __syncthreads inside the loop
// Optimize access patterns to shared memory to minimize bank conflicts
// Reduce global memory access by using register variables where possible
// Take advantage of loop unrolling for the reduction loop
// Consider optimizing block and grid dimensions for given hardware limitations
// Ensure the shared memory's size is compatible with intended block size
