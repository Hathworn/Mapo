// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Minimize thread divergence within the reduction loop
// Use __syncthreads() for synchronization after each reduction step
// Perform reduction in shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Consider occupancy and thread block size for optimal performance
