```
// Consider using shared memory for input data to optimize memory access
// Reduce unnecessary memory accesses by loading data into shared memory once
// Use warp shuffle instructions if supported to reduce synchronization overhead
// Check if all threads in a warp need synchronization to reduce __syncthreads() calls
```
