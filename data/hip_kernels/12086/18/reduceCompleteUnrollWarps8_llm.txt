```
// Encourage coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to stage data for more efficient access
// Leverage loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have reached the same point
// Aim to reduce branching to improve warp execution efficiency
// Use volatile keyword wisely to manage compiler optimizations 
// Explore additional unrolling of warp iterations to eliminate further thread divergence
