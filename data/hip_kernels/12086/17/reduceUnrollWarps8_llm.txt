```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve performance
// Utilize loop unrolling to maximize instruction throughput
// Replace __syncthreads with warp-level primitives where possible
// Use volatile keyword to prevent reordering and optimize memory access
```
