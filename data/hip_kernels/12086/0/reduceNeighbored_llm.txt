```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous memory patterns
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop
// Consider using shared memory to reduce access latency from global memory
// Reuse allocated shared memory by copying data to it before the reduction loop
// Optimize synchronization points to avoid unnecessary barriers
```
