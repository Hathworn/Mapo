```cpp
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to optimize memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory effectively for inter-thread communication.
// Utilize warp shuffle operations if supported for further reduction.
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing data reuse.
// Consider loop unrolling for shared memory reduction.
// Address potential bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Assess the impact of padding shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance.
