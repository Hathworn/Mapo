```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data from global memory to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead and improve performance.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring data alignment and reducing bank conflicts.
// Consider using warp-level primitives (e.g., __shfl_xor_sync) for reduction to reduce shared memory dependency.
// Avoid unnecessary boundary checks to eliminate redundant instructions.
// Use dynamic shared memory allocation only when required to avoid excessive shared memory usage.
