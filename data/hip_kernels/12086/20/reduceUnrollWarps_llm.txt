```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to achieve coalesced memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, which are more costly
// Unroll loops further when beneficial to leverage parallel execution
// Use warp-level primitives for the last warp to minimize synchronization overhead
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Assess if bank conflicts in shared memory are present and align data accordingly
