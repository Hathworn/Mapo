// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for normalization factors.
// Reduce bank conflicts when using shared memory by padding.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Utilize vectorized operations where possible for memory loads/stores.
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and reduced resource contention.
// Use warp shuffle operations for efficient data manipulation within warps.
