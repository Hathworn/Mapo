```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring stride values do not cause bank conflicts.
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access.
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized for better performance.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data like 'src' for cache efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead for small loops.
// Minimize register usage by reassessing variables scope and usage.
