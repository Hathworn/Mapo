```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better performance
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory traffic
// Avoid using more registers than necessary to allow greater thread occupancy
// Check if loop unrolling could be beneficial for computational tasks
// Verify if the use of __restrict__ pointers improves memory access patterns
