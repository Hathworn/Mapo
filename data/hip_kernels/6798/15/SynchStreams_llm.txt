```
// Consider utilizing shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing memory reads/writes
// Experiment with different block and thread configurations for optimal performance
// Analyze if loop unrolling could benefit the kernel
// Check if reducing register usage could improve occupancy
