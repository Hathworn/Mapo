// Use coalesced access patterns when loading and storing data
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Evaluate benefits of loop unrolling in reduction for improved performance
// Investigate the use of atomic operations if concurrent writes are a bottleneck
// Profile memory access patterns to ensure optimal bandwidth usage
