```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved performance
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branching within the kernel to enhance efficiency
// Use shared memory for common sub-expressions to reduce global memory traffic
// Opt for warp-based operations to reduce the overall instruction overhead
