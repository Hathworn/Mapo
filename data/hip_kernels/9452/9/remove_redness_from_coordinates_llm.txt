```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring the computation loops
// Optimize loop bounds to avoid redundant calculations and accesses
// Consider prefetching data to maximize memory throughput
// Use ushort2 to store indices and reduce arithmetic operations
