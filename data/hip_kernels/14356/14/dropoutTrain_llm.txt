```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput
// Employ shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data within the block
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Utilize vectorized memory operations for improved performance
```
