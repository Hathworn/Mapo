```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if the same data is reused by multiple threads.
// Consider using cooperative groups or warp-level primitives for potentially improved performance.
// Ensure optimal block size and grid configuration for better memory throughput.
// Prefer coalesced memory accesses to improve memory performance.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters if pointers are non-overlapping.
// Evaluate the use of memory access patterns and optimize address calculations.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations or ensure they are used efficiently if needed.
