```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput if applicable
// Minimize register and shared memory usage to maximize occupancy
// Ensure kernel execution configuration is optimal for your specific device
