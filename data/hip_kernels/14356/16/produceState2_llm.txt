// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory operations
// Optimize warp occupancy by ensuring thread divergence is minimized
// Consider pre-fetching global memory values to shared memory
// Align shared memory usage to the dimensions of warp size
// Try using loop unrolling techniques for the summation loop
