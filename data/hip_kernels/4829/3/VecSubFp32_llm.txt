```
// Leverage coalesced memory access by ensuring input arrays are aligned and accessed sequentially
// Consider using shared memory if the input data can be reused across threads to reduce global memory access
// Use __restrict__ keyword as done to inform the compiler there are no aliasing pointers, which allows for better optimization
// Optimize block size to ensure high occupancy and minimize memory latency
