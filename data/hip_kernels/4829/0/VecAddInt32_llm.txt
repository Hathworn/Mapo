```
// Ensure data is coalesced for coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if possible
// Minimize memory bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations for data transfer
// Optimize block size for hardware occupancy and efficiency
