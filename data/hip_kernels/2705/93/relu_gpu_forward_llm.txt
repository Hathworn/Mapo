```
// Use shared memory to cache data for better memory access patterns
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized loads for improved throughput
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow similar execution paths
// Tune block and grid sizes to maximize GPU occupancy
