```c++
// Consider coalescing global memory access for g_idata to improve memory throughput
// Minimize idle threads by managing out-of-bounds threads more efficiently
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory reads for performance gains
// Ensure balance of workload among threads to minimize divergence
// Consider loop unrolling for the reduction loop to enhance performance
