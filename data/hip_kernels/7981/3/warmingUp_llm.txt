```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper data alignment.
// Reduce global memory accesses by maximizing usage of shared memory.
// Aim to keep the global memory bandwidth high and underutilized.
// Consider occupying all SIMD lanes with active threads.
// Reduce warp divergence in the reduction loop to enhance performance.
// Optimize block size to fully utilize the GPU's compute resources.
