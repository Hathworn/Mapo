```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput
// Minimize synchronization barriers for efficiency
// Ensure memory access is fully coalesced during unrolling
// Use volatile keyword to prevent compiler reordering in the warp reduction
```
