```
// Consider using shared memory to load data initially to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced accesses when loading data.
// Unrolling the loop to handle 8 elements helps increase instruction throughput.
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is correctly applied whenever shared memory is updated by multiple threads.
// Use volatile pointers in the last warp to ensure proper ordering and visibility of memory operations.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce the number of synchronization points in the last warp.
