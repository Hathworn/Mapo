```
// Consider unrolling the loop to increase instruction level parallelism and reduce loop overhead
// Use the __restrict__ qualifier on pointers to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Check for coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory access
// Minimize thread divergence within warp execution to improve performance
// Optimize shared memory usage to fit into limited shared memory per block
// Consider aligning data structures to improve memory access speed
