```c++
// Consider using shared memory to cache reads from global memory
// Use coalesced access patterns when loading data from global memory
// Ensure minimal divergence within warp using appropriate control structures
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize reduction further
// Evaluate if memory alignment can be optimized for boundary checks
