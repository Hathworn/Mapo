```
// Consider using shared memory for initial data loading to reduce global memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling techniques for further optimization where applicable
// Minimize thread divergence for better efficiency
// Assess memory alignment to optimize access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory access for g_idata loading
// Evaluate block size and grid size configurations for optimal occupancy and resource utilization
