```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning buffer accesses when possible
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if possible
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper alignment
// Minimize divergent branches within warp executions
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to utilize instruction-level parallelism
```
