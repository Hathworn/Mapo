```
// Precompute interval for efficiency to reduce computational overhead
// Use shared memory to cache weights for faster access (only if fits into shared memory)
// Ensure that shared memory size is specified based on blockDim.x to avoid overflow
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading weights into shared memory
// Optimize index calculation by minimizing variable dependency and using parallel assignment
