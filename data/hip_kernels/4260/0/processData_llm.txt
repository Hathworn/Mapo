```
// Use shared memory efficiently by loading filter in one warp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better performance
// Avoid redundant synchronization by minimizing __syncthreads() usage
// Optimize for warp size to reduce underutilization and improve occupancy
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to hint non-aliasing
