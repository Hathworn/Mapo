```c
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for tiles
// Ensure coalesced global memory access to improve performance
// Consider loop unrolling for better ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Reduce thread divergence by aligning block and grid sizes
// Minimize global memory access by reusing data in registers
// Avoid bank conflicts by proper alignment in shared memory
