```
// Consider using vectorized loads to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses for improved performance.
// Optimize shared memory usage to eliminate bank conflicts.
// Consider prefetching data to registers to hide memory latency.
// Use loop unrolling pragma to further reduce loop overhead.
