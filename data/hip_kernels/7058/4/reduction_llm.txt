```
// Use coalesced memory accesses when loading data into shared memory
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() for improved performance
// Consider loop unrolling further to optimize reduction steps
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring BANK CONFLICT is avoided
// Use warp-level primitives if targeting newer architectures for additional speedup
