```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize thread block size to improve occupancy and warp utilization
// Minimize the use of printf as it can significantly slow down kernel execution
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal throughput
// Avoid thread divergence to maintain efficient execution
