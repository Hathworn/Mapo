// Consider coalesced memory access for the input array to improve global memory bandwidth
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Use appropriate block size that fits within the SM resources for better occupancy
// Leverage atomic operations for reduction if applicable in further iterations
