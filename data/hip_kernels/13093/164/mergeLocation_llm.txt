```
// Use __restrict__ pointers to help compiler optimize memory access patterns.
// Ensure that loc_ is accessed in a coalesced manner to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Consider using shared memory if loc_ is repeatedly accessed by contiguous threads.
// Prefetch loc_ values into registers to reduce global memory latency.
// Minimize register usage by using short data types where applicable.
// Use the minimum number of registers to hold intermediate values.
