```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes wherever possible
// Consider using shared memory to stage data for improved access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring conditionals to align with warp execution
// Evaluate the possibility of using texture memory for read-only data to enhance cache usage
// Ensure atomic operations are necessary and evaluate alternatives for reduction patterns
