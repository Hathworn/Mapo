```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use texture memory for read-only data to improve cache efficiency
// Minimize memory divergence by coalescing memory access patterns
// Use memory prefetching to hide global memory latency
// Ensure proper occupancy by adjusting block and grid sizes
// Consider employing loop unrolling for computational optimization
