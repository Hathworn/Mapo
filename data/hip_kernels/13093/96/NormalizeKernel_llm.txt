```
// Use shared memory to store normalization_factor for coalesced access if possible
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for image to reduce memory transactions
// Ensure memory alignment for normalization_factor and image to optimize access patterns
// Minimize the use of branching by rearranging conditions to prioritize common execution paths
