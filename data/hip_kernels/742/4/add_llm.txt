```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory traffic
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to minimize loop overhead and enhance instruction throughput
// Assess the use of vectorized data types for memory accesses to improve data loading efficiency
