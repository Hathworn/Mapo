```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive global memory addresses
// Minimize warp divergence by aligning thread tasks and conditions
// Prefer __nvcuda__ operations for more efficient calculations if available
// Pre-load data into registers when repeatedly used within the kernel
