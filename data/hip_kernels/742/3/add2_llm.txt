```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access pattern for arrays b, g, r, and a
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing array 'gc' by aligning memory layout properly
// Consider optimizing constant multiplications (e.g., 0.00390625f) by using bit shifts if applicable
// Evaluate potential benefits of using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency
