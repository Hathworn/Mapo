// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory for better performance
// Utilize warp-level primitives for efficient reduction operations
// Consider using atomic operations for resolving race conditions
// Apply loop unrolling to enhance execution efficiency
