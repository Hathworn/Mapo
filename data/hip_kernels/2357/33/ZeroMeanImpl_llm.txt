```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the solutions array
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper memory alignment
// Optimize the reduction step to minimize synchronization overhead
// Ensure that the inBlockOffset calculations do not cause divergent memory access
