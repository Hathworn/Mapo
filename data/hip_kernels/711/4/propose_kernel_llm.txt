```
// Align memory accesses where possible by ensuring data is contiguous
// Use shared memory to cache rowptr and col if enough shared memory is available
// Minimize the use of global memory where possible by storing intermediate values in registers
// Consider loop unrolling if the number of iterations is known at compile time
// Ensure memory coalescing for accesses to the col array
// Merge conditional statements into a single check if applicable to reduce instruction counts
