// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like col and proposal to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Unroll the loop further for potential performance boost when row degree is consistently small.
// Try thread block synchronization to minimize warp divergence.
