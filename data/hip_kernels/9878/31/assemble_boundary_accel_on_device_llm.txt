```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning d_ibool_interfaces and d_send_accel_buffer accesses
// Minimize the divergent branches, especially the boundary check and within local_id condition
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize the use of atomic operations to prevent serialization bottlenecks
// Ensure memory alignment for better memory access efficiency
// Reorder data structures if necessary to enhance memory coalescing and access patterns
