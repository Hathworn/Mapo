```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for d_ibool_interfaces and d_send_potential_dot_dot_buffer.
// Evaluate shared memory usage for d_nibool_interfaces to avoid repeated global memory access.
// Optimize thread index calculations for possible reduction of integer arithmetic overhead.
// Ensure atomic operation is used minimally by optimizing data access order.
