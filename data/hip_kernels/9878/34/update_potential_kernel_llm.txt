// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access overhead.
// Evaluate the use of memory coalescing to improve access patterns.
// Check if the loop can be unrolled for higher throughput.
// Use asynchronous memory copies to overlap data transfer and computation.
// Verify and optimize memory access alignment.
