```c
// Optimize memory access by ensuring data is coalesced
// Use shared memory if multiple reads to rmass[id] occur
// Minimize branch divergence with uniform grid dimensions
// Ensure grid and block dimensions utilize hardware capabilities efficiently
// Consider using loop unrolling if computations are repetitive
```
