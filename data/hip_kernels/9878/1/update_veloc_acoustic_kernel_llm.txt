```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring warp-friendly data alignment.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if the same data is accessed multiple times.
// Increase block size if the occupancy is not optimal, balancing with register usage.
// Use vectorized loads/stores to improve memory throughput if appropriate for data layout.
// Explore using asynchronous memory prefetching to hide memory latency.
// If applicable, consider loop unrolling for the velocity update operation.
