```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to maximize memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring proper access patterns
// Use shared memory if further optimization is needed for data reuse
// Consider loop unrolling for increased performance
// Make sure occupancy is maximized by choosing appropriate block size
```
