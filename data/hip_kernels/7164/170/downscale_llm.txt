```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache tile data and reduce global memory accesses
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by adjusting the index calculations
// Unroll inner loops to improve performance and instruction-level parallelism
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for your hardware
// If possible, use half precision or mixed precision to reduce memory bandwidth pressure
