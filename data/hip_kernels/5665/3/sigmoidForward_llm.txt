```
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler with aliasing optimizations
// Ensure the V array is coalesced for global memory access to optimize bandwidth
// Use shared memory if multiple threads in the block access the same data from V
// Increase occupancy by adjusting block size or using __launch_bounds__ if needed
// Test for optimal launch configuration to maximize hardware utilization
// Explore using vectorized types like float4 for potential memory access improvements
