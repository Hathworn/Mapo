```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize index calculations for better performance
// Avoid divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Ensure data is properly aligned to facilitate vectorized loads
