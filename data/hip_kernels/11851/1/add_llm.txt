// Use coalesced memory access for optimal memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure data alignment for efficient memory transactions
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data in large arrays
// Minimize global memory access by reusing data within registers when possible
// Tune block size to achieve maximum occupancy and efficient resource usage
