```
// Consider using coalesced access patterns for global memory reads and writes to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory effectively by loading neighboring elements to reduce global memory accesses within the tile.
// Use a loop to load data into shared memory for greater flexibility and potentially larger block sizes.
// Explore optimizing the grid and block dimensions to strike a balance between occupancy and memory access efficiency.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
