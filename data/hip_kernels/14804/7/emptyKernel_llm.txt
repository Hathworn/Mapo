```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Minimize bank conflicts by appropriately aligning data structures
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider memory prefetching to hide global memory latency
// Structure data for efficient burst access patterns
// Use appropriate block and grid dimensions to achieve optimal occupancy
