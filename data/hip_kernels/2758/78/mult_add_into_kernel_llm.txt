// Consider using shared memory to store elements of 'a' and 'b' for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance depending on the hardware
// Utilize memory padding to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory
