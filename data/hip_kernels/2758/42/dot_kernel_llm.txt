```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to buffer 'output' data and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses when reading 'output' in the inner loop
// Minimize the use of atomic operations or restructure code to reduce contention
// Apply loop unrolling to the inner loops for potential performance gains
// Investigate warp divergence caused by the 'if (f2 <= f1) continue;' condition and optimize
```
