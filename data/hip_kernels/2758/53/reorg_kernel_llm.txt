```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with memory layout
// Consider using shared memory for reuse and to minimize global memory access
// Optimize stride calculations to reduce redundant operations
// Minimize divergence by ensuring thread blocks execute the same control paths
// Use loop unrolling if beneficial in this context to increase parallelism
