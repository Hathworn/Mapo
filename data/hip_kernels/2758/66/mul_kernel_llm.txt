```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning INCX and INCY values to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to cache data locally within each block, reducing global memory traffic
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations if data integrity issues arise in concurrent updates
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to increase GPU occupancy and reduce warp divergence
// Profile the application to identify any further memory bottlenecks and optimize load/store patterns
