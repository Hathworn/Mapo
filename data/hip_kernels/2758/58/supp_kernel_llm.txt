```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible.
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Make use of vectorized loads/stores if applicable for float data.
// Ensure that INCX is aligned to avoid uncoalesced access patterns.
// Analyze occupancy and consider adjusting block and grid sizes for optimal performance.
