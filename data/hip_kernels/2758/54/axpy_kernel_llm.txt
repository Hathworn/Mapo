// Ensure X and Y are properly aligned to improve memory access patterns
// Minimize memory divergence through coalesced access
// Use shared memory if possible for reusable data 
// Consider reducing register pressure through efficient loop unrolling
// Optimize thread block size for maximum GPU occupancy
