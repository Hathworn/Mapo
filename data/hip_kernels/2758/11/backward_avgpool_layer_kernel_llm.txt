```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for out_delta
// Consider optimizing in_delta updates for better memory access pattern
// Ensure precomputed scale factor reduces redundant calculations
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring uniform instructions within the warp
// Evaluate potential benefits of shared memory usage for repetitive out_delta access
