```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure that shared memory usage is within bounds and synchronize threads
// Coalesce global memory writes to improve memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by proper indexing
// Minimize strided access patterns to reduce memory latency
