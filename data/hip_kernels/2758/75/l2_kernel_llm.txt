```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Potentially use shared memory if there are opportunities for data reuse within the block
// Evaluate the use of __ldg for read-only data to leverage cache efficiently
// Optimize block and grid size configuration based on hardware occupancy
