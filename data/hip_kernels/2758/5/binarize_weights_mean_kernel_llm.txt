```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to reduce memory latency
// Ensure that binary and weights arrays are properly aligned in memory
// Use shared memory to store mean_arr_gpu values to minimize global memory access
// Adjust block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy and memory usage
// Unroll loops if applicable to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput
