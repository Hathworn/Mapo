```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache input and weights tiles for better memory access patterns.
// Optimize by coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use loop unrolling for inner loops to enhance instruction-level parallelism and reduce loop overhead.
// Evaluate using half precision (FP16) if precision requirements allow to improve performance on supported hardware.
// Investigate potential benefits of using warp-level primitives for reduction operations.
