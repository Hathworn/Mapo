```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by reordering data layout if possible
// Minimize thread divergence by reducing conditional branches
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to reduce synchronization overhead
// Evaluate the use of float4 or float2 for vectorized loading if applicable
// Align data on memory boundaries to optimize access patterns
// Reduce redundant memory accesses by caching frequently used data locally
// Consider loop unrolling for reducing loop overhead
