```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results of input and output for reducing global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access through proper indexing.
// Try to minimize divergence within warp by ensuring all threads perform similar operations.
// Use more blocks for better occupancy if the number of threads per block is small.
// Evaluate whether the use of texture memory could provide performance benefits for frequently accessed data.
