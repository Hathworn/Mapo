// Use shared memory for partial sums to reduce access to global memory
// Ensure shared memory is properly initialized to prevent garbage values
// Check array bounds early to avoid unnecessary computation
// Try to coalesce global memory access in the loop for better performance
// Consider using atomic operations if race conditions are detected
