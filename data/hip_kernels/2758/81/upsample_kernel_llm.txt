```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Utilize constant memory where applicable for values that do not change during kernel execution.
// Align data when possible to improve memory coalescing.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to leverage texture cache for devices with compute capability 3.5 or higher.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Evaluate warp divergence and attempt to minimize it by reordering conditions or loops.
// Consider loop unrolling if loops are present to reduce loop overhead.
// Check for opportunities to use vectorized loads and stores to improve memory throughput.
