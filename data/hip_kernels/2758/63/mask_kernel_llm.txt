```c
// Suggest using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'x' and 'mask' arrays
// Ensure data is aligned in memory to prevent misaligned access
// Use __restrict__ keyword for 'x' and 'mask' if no aliasing occurs
// Evaluate the use of half-precision if acceptable for reduced memory bandwidth
