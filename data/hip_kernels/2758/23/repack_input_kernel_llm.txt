```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning reads and writes
// Optimize memory access patterns for better throughput
// Consider employing shared memory for reusing common data among threads
// Pay attention to bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Use __restrict__ to avoid potential aliasing issues
// Consider loop unrolling for reducing instruction overhead
// Analyze the possibility of warp-level primitives for better efficiency
// Optimize occupancy by tuning block and grid sizes
