// Consider increasing block size for higher occupancy
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access times
// Implement coalesced memory access for gt_gpu and a_avg_gpu
// Synchronize threads with __syncthreads to avoid race conditions
// Ensure enough shared memory allocation to fit the data
