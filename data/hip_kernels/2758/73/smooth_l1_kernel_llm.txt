```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for pred and truth arrays to optimize memory bandwidth
// Consider double buffering technique to hide memory latency
// Implement shared memory if calculations involve common data among threads
// Examine loop unrolling for minor performance gain in the branch condition
// Evaluate atomic operations for error array updates to avoid race conditions in parallel execution
