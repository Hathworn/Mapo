```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing conditionals
// Utilize shared memory if beneficial for repeated data access within the block
// Explore optimal block size and thread configuration for GPU occupancy
// Align memory accesses to improve computational efficiency
