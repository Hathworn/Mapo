```
// Use shared memory for variables frequently accessed by threads to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction throughput
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider adjusting block and grid sizes for better occupancy and performance
// Preload data to registers when applicable to decrease latency of memory access
// Utilize constants for invariant data where possible to optimize memory access
