```
// Consider memory coalescing to improve global memory access for the input and weights arrays.
// Utilize shared memory to store tile data for input and weights to reduce global memory access.
// Unroll the inner loops to increase ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism) and reduce loop overhead.
// Align the input and weights data to improve read/write efficiency and avoid bank conflicts.
// Prefetch data if possible to overlap data transfer with computations.
