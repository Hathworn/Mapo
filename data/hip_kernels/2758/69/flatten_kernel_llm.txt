```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the 'x' and 'out' arrays
// Use shared memory to cache data if possible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve memory access efficiency
// Utilize asynchronous memory operations if applicable to hide latency
// Optimize the conditional branch to minimize warp divergence
// Consider loop unrolling strategies if applicable to further optimize performance
```
