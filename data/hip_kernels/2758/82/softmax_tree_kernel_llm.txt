```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by organizing data layout to align with memory warp
// Optimize by using shared memory to store intermediate results for reduction in softmax_device_new_api
// Use shuffle operations or warp intrinsics for reduction within the softmax_device_new_api to minimize bank conflicts
// Minimize global memory access by storing and reusing computation results in registers within the softmax_device_new_api
// Implement loop unrolling in the softmax_device_new_api for operations over n to reduce instruction overhead
