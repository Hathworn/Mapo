// Pre-compute constants like scale to reduce computational overhead within the kernel
// Use efficient indexing calculations to minimize repeated computations within loop iterations
// Consider padding memory or adjusting memory layout to optimize memory coalescing
// Reduce arithmetic operations like using diff * diff instead of powf for better performance
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data (e.g., mean) to reduce global memory access
// Employ loop unrolling techniques if beneficial for batch and spatial loops
