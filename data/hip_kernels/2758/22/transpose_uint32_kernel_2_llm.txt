```
// Ensure shared memory is optimally sized to reduce bank conflicts and improve memory access efficiency
// To avoid unnecessary data transfers, check boundary conditions before accessing global memory
// Switch global memory access pattern to coalesce accesses and maximize memory throughput
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() where possible to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Store results in global memory in a manner that maximizes coalesced writes
