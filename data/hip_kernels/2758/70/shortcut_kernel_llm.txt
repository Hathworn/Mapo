```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Pre-compute reused terms to minimize redundant operations
// Unroll loops if possible to improve performance
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed data if applicable
// Balance load across threads to maximize device utilization
// Ensure kernel is launched with optimal block and grid dimensions
```
