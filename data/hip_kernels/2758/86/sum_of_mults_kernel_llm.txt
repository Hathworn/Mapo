// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations within warps.
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp efficiency.
// Use vectorized loads to optimize memory bandwidth utilization if possible.
