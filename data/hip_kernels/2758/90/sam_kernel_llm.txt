```
// Use shared memory to cache data for repeated access by multiple threads
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for optimal global memory transactions
// Consider loop unrolling if the size and stride are fixed and known to improve throughput
