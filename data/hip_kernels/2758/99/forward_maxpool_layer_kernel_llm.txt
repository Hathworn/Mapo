// Use shared memory to cache input values for faster access during computation
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize loop order or unroll loops to minimize control flow divergence in warp threads
// Ensure optimal grid and block dimensions based on the computation needs and hardware capabilities
