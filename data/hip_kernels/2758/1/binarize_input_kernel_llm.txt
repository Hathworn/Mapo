```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input and binary arrays to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate computations like the mean to reduce global memory access.
// Explore using loop unrolling for the loop computing the mean and the binarization to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure proper grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and avoid divergence.
