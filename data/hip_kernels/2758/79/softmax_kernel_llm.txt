```
// Use shared memory to store input values to reduce global memory access
// Consider using warp-level primitives like warp shuffle to find the largest value
// Accumulate sum using shared memory and parallel reduction to avoid atomic operations
// Use separate kernel launches for different computational parts if needed for better parallelization
// Ensure proper memory alignment for faster access and coalescing
// Minimize use of atomic operations as they can serialize execution and reduce performance
// Consider using fast math functions for quicker computation
