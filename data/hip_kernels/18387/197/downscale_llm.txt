// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data to reduce repeated global memory access  
// Combine reads and writes to coalesce memory transactions for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data  
// Align memory accesses to warp boundaries for improved throughput  
// Replace manual loop unrolling with compiler directives such as #pragma unroll  
// Optimize irregular memory access patterns by restricting threads to contiguous indices  
// Use __restrict__ keyword for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data pointers to assist compiler optimization
