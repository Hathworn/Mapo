// Consider coalesced memory access for loading from d_a to improve memory throughput
// Preload data into shared memory to reduce global memory access within the inner loop
// Optimize use of shared memory to minimize bank conflicts
// Increase grid or block size if occupancy is low to better utilize GPU resources
