// Consider reorganizing memory access to maximize coalesced access
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform execution within warp
// Use shared memory for data reuse to reduce global memory traffic
// Prefer float4 or other vector types for faster memory access
// Avoid expensive arithmetic operations within the main loop
// Align memory allocations to maximize memory throughput
