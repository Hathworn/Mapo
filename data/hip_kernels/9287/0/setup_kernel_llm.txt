// Consider reducing global memory accesses by storing hiprandState in shared memory if multiple threads use the same state
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring proper alignment
// Explore using constant memory for `seed` if it's read-only and accessed frequently
