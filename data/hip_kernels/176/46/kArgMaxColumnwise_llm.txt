```
// Consider using float2 to load two elements at once for coalesced memory access
// Use __ldg intrinsic to speed up reading constant memory if mat is read-only
// Ensure the height is a multiple of 32 to maximize warp efficiency
// Consider reducing shared memory usage by using warp-level primitives like __shfl_xor
// Consider launching fewer blocks for larger widths to improve occupancy
