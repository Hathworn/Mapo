```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Optimize loop stride to improve memory coalescing
// Reduce warp divergence by ensuring the same number of iterations for all threads
// Apply warp-level reduction to decrease the number of synchronization points
// Ensure only one thread writes the result to the global memory to prevent race conditions
```
