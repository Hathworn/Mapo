```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to vectors a and b to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure alignment of a and b on optimal boundaries for better memory access patterns
// Use __restrict__ keyword if possible for a, b, and target if no aliasing occurs, to allow for compiler optimizations
// Consider using atomic operations for reduction if there's a need to reduce across blocks
// Possibly increase DP_BLOCKSIZE to better utilize shared memory and warp size if it doesn't exceed resource limits
// Minimize divergence by ensuring the block size is a multiple of warp size
