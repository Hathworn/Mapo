```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Use loop unrolling to enhance the performance of innermost loops
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory is updated
// Optimize calculations to minimize divergent branching
```
