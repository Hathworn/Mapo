```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory reads from src
// Ensure dst writes are also coalesced for better performance
// Use shared memory to cache src reads, minimizing global memory access
// Explore loop unrolling if applicable in larger computations
// Optimize register usage by reducing unnecessary variable declarations
