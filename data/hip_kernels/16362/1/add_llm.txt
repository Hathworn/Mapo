```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse occurs
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced
// Evaluate if loop unrolling improves performance
// Assess using warp-synchronous programming techniques
// Experiment with different thread block sizes for optimal performance
// Consider double buffering if data transfer overlaps with computation
