```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for improved efficiency
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access by threads in the same block
// Explore using warp shuffling to minimize dependence on shared memory for small data
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to maximize memory throughput
// Evaluate the impact of loop unrolling if applicable for the inner operations
