```
// Coalesced memory access for better performance: use row-major data layout
// Avoid redundant memory fetches by reusing values stored in registers
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Reduce conditional checks to streamline instruction execution
// Consider using loop unrolling for potential latency reduction
// Combine arithmetic operations to minimize computational overhead
