```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where applicable
// Coalesce memory access patterns to improve bandwidth usage
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated operations to enhance performance
// Optimize memory access by using texture memory if appropriate
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by adjusting block and grid sizes
