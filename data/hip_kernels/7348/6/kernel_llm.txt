```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory for optimal utilization
// Optimize instruction-level parallelism to maximize GPU core usage
```
