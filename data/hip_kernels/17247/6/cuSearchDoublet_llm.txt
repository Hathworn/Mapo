```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for spMmat, spBmat, and spTmat to improve memory throughput.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for input pointers to help the compiler with additional optimization.
// Explore replacing atomic operations with warp-level primitives if possible for better performance.
// Ensure shared memory usage is effective; avoid bank conflicts when accessing sharedMem.
// Evaluate if the use of constant memory is feasible for scalar constants like deltaRMin, deltaRMax, cotThetaMax, etc., to reduce global memory access.
// Investigate loop unrolling for fixed-size operations to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
