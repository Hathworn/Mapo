// Using shared memory to improve memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory utilization to optimize load/store operations
// Synchronize threads to avoid race conditions during shared memory operations
// Ensure thread synchronizations to facilitate safe data exchange between threads
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate computations to reduce global memory access
