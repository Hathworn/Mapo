```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize divergence
// Check if memory access patterns are coalesced
// Use vectorized loads/stores for improved memory throughput if applicable
// Ensure the kernel launch is asynchronous to avoid blocking CPU execution
