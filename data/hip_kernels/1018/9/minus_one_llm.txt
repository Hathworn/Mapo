// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use coalesced access patterns to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can optimize performance for larger loops
// Check if caching data in registers could reduce memory latency
