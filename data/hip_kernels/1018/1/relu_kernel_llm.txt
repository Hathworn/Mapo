```
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers to improve access speed
// Ensure memory access is coalesced to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Consider adjusting block and grid dimensions for best occupancy and performance
// Align memory accesses to cache line size to minimize cache misses
```
