```
// Use shared memory to cache matrix values and reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use warp-level primitives to further optimize memory access patterns
// Minimize conditional checks by structuring logic to reduce divergence
```
