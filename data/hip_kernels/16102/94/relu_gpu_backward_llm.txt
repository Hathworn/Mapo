// Consider coalesced memory access for ingrad, outgrad, and indata arrays
// Use shared memory to cache data within each block if possible
// Ensure that data access patterns reduce memory bank conflicts
// Maximize occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size
// Validate memory alignment for potential coalescing benefits
