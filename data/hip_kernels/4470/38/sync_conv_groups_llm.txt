```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize data layout for memory access patterns to improve cache performance
// Use loop unrolling techniques if applicable to reduce control overhead
// Evaluate using register blocking to maximize data reuse in registers
// Explore asynchrony by overlapping computation and memory transfers
