// Consider optimizing memory access by using coalesced accesses
// Ensure shared memory usage is within hardware limits
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Verify the use of __syncthreads() for proper synchronization
// Ensure global memory writes are coalesced
// Review kernel launch configuration for optimal occupancy
// Evaluate the potential of further loop unrolling (if applicable)
