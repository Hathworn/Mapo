```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning d_xAx, d_bx, d_c, and d_y memory allocations
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results if operating on multiple elements
// Reduce global memory accesses by caching repetitive accesses in registers
// Minimize memory latency by prefetching data if workloads allow
