```c
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access to global memory.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory for better performance.
// Consider loop unrolling for the dot product calculation to improve throughput.
