```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if possible.
// Ensure the use of appropriate data types to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Ensure the grid and block size are optimized for the target GPU architecture.
// Profile and adjust the stride length to improve load balancing.
