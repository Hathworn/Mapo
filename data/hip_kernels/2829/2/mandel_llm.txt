```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access for writing to the buffer by using sequential thread indices.
// Consider padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if shared memory optimizations are added.
// Minimize divergent branches by aligning warp operations where possible.
// Explore the use of cached memory or shared memory to store repetitive values like dx and dy if leveraged multiple times.
// Analyze the register usage to minimize spills and optimize performance.
