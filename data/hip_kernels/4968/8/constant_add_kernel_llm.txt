```
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized by setting shared_data size to blockDim.x
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns
// Ensure proper memory alignment for efficient global memory access
// Take advantage of half-warp access while reading and writing to shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to ensure memory coherence
// Assess warp divergence and minimize it by aligning condition checks
