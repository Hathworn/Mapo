```
// Consider using coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses in the global memory.
// Utilize warp-level primitives for reduction to further optimize the shared memory usage and reduce synchronization overhead.
// Ensure bank conflicts in shared memory are minimized by carefully aligning memory accesses.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts if applicable.
