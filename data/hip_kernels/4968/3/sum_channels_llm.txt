```cpp
// Consider coalesced loads by organizing shared memory access patterns.
// Reduce shared memory usage by minimizing redundant data loading.
// Improve memory access efficiency by ensuring aligned memory accesses.
// Try loop unrolling in the accumulation loop for performance gain.
// Ensure use of __syncthreads() only when necessary to avoid over-synchronization.
