```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by storing real and imaginary parts separately in two arrays.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses and reduce latency.
// Ensure all threads in a warp execute if-condition together to avoid divergence.
// Group accesses to `result` for improved memory throughput and cache utilization.
