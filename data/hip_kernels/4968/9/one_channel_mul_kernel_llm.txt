// Consider coalescing memory accesses for both data_l and data_r arrays.
// Ensure that memory accesses for data_r are aligned to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable compiler optimizations.
// Explore using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for complex multiplication within the if statement.
