```
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider memory coalescing to optimize memory access patterns
// Prefer using warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization overhead
// Explore thread block size adjustments for better occupancy
// Use asynchronous copies to hide memory latency
