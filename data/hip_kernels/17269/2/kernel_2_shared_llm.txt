```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure only necessary initialization in shared memory.
// Limit atomic operations to minimize performance bottlenecks.
// Reduce thread divergence by organizing memory access patterns.
// Avoid excessive synchronization where not necessary.
// Balance shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts.
// Consider coalesced memory access for global memory efficiency.
// Ensure efficient block and grid configurations for optimal performance.
