```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses for both vector and output arrays
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
// Consider using vectorized data types (e.g., float4) for memory operations
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for better resource utilization
