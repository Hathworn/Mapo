```
// Use shared memory to cache data for better memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling if possible to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Use __syncthreads() carefully if using shared memory to avoid race conditions
