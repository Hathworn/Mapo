```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive data elements
// Align data access for improved memory throughput
// Evaluate the need for loop unrolling in case of repeated patterns
// Use __restrict__ keyword to inform the compiler about non-aliasing pointers for possible optimization
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths
