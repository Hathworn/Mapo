```
// Consider using shared memory for caching frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for x, v, and y
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency
// Align data structures to ensure optimal memory transactions
