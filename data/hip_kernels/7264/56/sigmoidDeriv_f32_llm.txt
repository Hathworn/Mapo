```
// Utilize shared memory to buffer vector data and reduce global memory accesses
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and potentially increase instruction throughput
// Consider using a more memory efficient data type if precision allows, such as half-precision
// Optimize the load and store operations by ensuring they are coalesced
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal occupancy and performance
