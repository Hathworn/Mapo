```
// Consider memory coalescing, ensure consecutive threads access contiguous memory addresses for x, v, and y
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if data reuse within block is possible
// Minimize use of global memory; maximize use of registers for temporary variables
// Ensure the arithmetic intensity is high to better hide memory latency
