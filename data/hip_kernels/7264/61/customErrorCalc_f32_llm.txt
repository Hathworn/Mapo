```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Use more shared memory to load ideal_vector if resources allow
// Try reducing the number of conditional statements for better warp efficiency
// Optimize memory usage by minimizing the usage of shared memory per thread block
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory where possible
