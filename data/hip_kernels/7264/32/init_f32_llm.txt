```
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching to improve memory access patterns
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and reduce memory latency
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
