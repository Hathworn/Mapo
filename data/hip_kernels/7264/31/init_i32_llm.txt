```
// Use grid-stride loop to efficiently handle large data by maximizing GPU utilization
// Ensure memory coalescing by having threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers if applicable to help the compiler with optimization
// Check if shared memory could be utilized for better performance in more complex kernels
