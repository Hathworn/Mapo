```
// Use shared memory for caching x[idx] values if multiple accesses are needed
// Ensure coalesced memory access for y[idx] by assigning contiguous memory locations to consecutive threads
// Consider loop unrolling if idx operation can be broken into smaller independent tasks
// Evaluate using texture memory for x and y arrays if it improves access latency
