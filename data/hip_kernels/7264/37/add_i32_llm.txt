// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory for small datasets to reduce global memory access latency
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring uniform loop execution across threads
// Prefer vector types for memory operations if applicable to improve throughput
