```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring y[idx] is accessed in a sequence by consecutive threads
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy and minimize thread divergence
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations if the hardware supports it, especially for operations on contiguous memory locations
// Check if prefetching data to the cache improves performance due to predictable access patterns
// Minimize register usage by optimizing the operations and consider using local memory if appropriate
