```
// Consider using shared memory to cache the kernel data for faster access.
// Optimize memory access patterns for input and output matrices to ensure coalesced access.
// Verify the use of float for sufficient precision and consider alternatives if needed.
// Adjust block and grid sizes for optimal GPU utilization and to minimize warp divergence.
