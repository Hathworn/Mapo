```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_dot1, d_dot2, d_dist, and d_azimut
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate values like lat1_radians
// Pre-compute _PI / 180 and store in a constant memory to reduce repetitive calculations
// Check for occupancy optimization by adjusting block and grid dimensions
