// Avoid unnecessary accesses to global memory by using shared memory
// Prevent threads from accessing out-of-bound indices
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed row elements
// Synchronize threads after initializing shared memory
// Add an early exit condition for elements that are far apart
// Perform reduction to avoid updating global memory too often
