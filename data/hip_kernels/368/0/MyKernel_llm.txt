// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Minimize shared memory usage by relying on registers for temporary storage
// Ensure proper alignment for memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() only if necessary to avoid serialization overhead
// Consider loop unrolling for better utilization of compute resources
