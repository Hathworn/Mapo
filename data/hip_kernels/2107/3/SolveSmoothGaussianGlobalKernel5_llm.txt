```
// Consider pre-loading data into shared memory for faster access.
// Use shared memory for the input arrays to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize conditional checks by precomputing indices.
// Ensure thread synchronization after loading shared memory.
// Reduce redundant calculations by storing results of row and column indices in variables.
// Try to reduce boundary checks by computing valid indices beforehand.
