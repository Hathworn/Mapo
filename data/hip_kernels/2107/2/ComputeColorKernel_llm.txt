```
// Consider optimizing shared memory allocation for the colorwheel arrays to reduce redundant initialization.
// Use memory coalescing techniques when accessing the input and output arrays to improve memory read/write throughput.
// For threads that are inactive due to boundary conditions, optimize by reducing divergence.
// Investigate if wider vector loads/stores can be applied for the colorwheel arrays to increase load efficiency.
// Check the effectiveness of shared memory usageâ€”ensuring all threads within the block benefit from initialized values.
// Assess if rearranging computations to group dependent calculations minimizes register usage and improves latency hiding.
