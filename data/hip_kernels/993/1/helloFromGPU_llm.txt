```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Employ coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Fuse kernel launches or combine operations to reduce overhead.
// Apply thread block and grid optimization for better resource utilization.
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations for latency hiding.
