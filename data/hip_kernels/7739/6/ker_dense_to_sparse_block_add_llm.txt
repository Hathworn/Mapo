```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'src' to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache 'trg' data if there are multiple updates per block.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce contention when accessing the 'trg' array.
// Optimize atomic operations by reducing their frequency or by using warp-aggregated atomics.
// Align 'src' and 'trg' pointers to improve memory access efficiency and reduce bank conflicts.
