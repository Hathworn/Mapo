```c
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescence
// Ensure idx and src arrays are aligned to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse and reducing global memory traffic
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threads within a warp execute similar instructions
// Explore prefetching upcoming memory accesses to hide latency
