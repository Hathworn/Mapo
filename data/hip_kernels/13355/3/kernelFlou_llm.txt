```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Prefetch data to shared memory before computation.
// Consider using vectorized operations to optimize memory reads/writes.
// Align memory access patterns to improve coalescing.
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Explore further optimization by using warp-level primitives where applicable.
