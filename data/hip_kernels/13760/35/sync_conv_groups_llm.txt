```cpp
// Consider increasing the block size for better resource utilization
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory transactions
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance execution efficiency
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory latency
// Utilize asynchronous memory copies to overlap computation and data transfer
```
