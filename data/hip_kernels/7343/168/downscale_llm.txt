```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive addresses
// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning data properly in shared memory
// Use warp-wise operations to enhance parallel efficiency
