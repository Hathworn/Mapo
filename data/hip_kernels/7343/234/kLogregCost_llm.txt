// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data such as maxProbs to reduce global memory access latency.
// Implement coalesced memory access for probs and labels arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure __logf is used for fast logarithmic computations, as suggested.
// Consider reducing divergent branches by reorganizing if-else logic within the kernel.
// Utilize loop unrolling effectively with #pragma unroll to minimize overhead in loop execution.
// Check for efficient mapping of threads to elements to minimize idle threads in blocks.
