```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Optimize reduction with warp shuffle instructions if possible
// Consider using float2 or float4 to coalesce memory loads if data alignment allows
// Ensure that shared memory is used efficiently to prevent bank conflicts
```
