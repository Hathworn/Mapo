```
// Consider using shared memory to cache sub-matrices and reduce redundant global memory access.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing global memory reads and writes.
// Use constant memory for immutable kernel arguments when applicable.
