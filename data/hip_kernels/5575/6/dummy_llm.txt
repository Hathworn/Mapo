// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve global memory bandwidth
// Consider data alignment to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory
// Use registers wisely to enhance compiler optimization and reduce memory access latency
// Explore warp-level primitives to optimize synchronization over __syncthreads()
