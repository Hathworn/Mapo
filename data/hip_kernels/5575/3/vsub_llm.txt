// Consider using coalesced memory access for a, b, and c arrays.
// Ensure proper alignment of data for optimal memory access patterns.
// Explore using shared memory if accessing elements repeatedly.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to maximize thread utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling for operations within the kernel function.
