```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache data and minimize global memory access
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use loop unrolling for operations within the critical path to reduce loop overhead
// Align memory accesses to improve cache performance and utilization
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better workload distribution and hardware utilization
// Implement data prefetching strategies to hide memory latency
```
