```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the input data to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure weights are loaded efficiently to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Optimize the use of shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Examine bank conflicts in shared memory and adjust access patterns accordingly
// Prefetch data where possible to hide memory latency
