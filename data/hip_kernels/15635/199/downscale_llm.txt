```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory accesses in gradOutput_data by optimizing translate_idx_inv calculations
// Utilize vectorized loads and stores if applicable to further enhance memory throughput
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
// Ensure enough threads per block to fully utilize available memory bandwidth
