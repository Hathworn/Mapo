```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() only when absolutely necessary to avoid synchronization overhead
// Optimize for occupancy by balancing register and shared memory usage
