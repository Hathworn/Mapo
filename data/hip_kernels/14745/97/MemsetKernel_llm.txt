// Ensure coalesced memory access by ordering threads to avoid strided access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Maximize occupancy by tuning block size and using __launch_bounds to control resource allocation
// Use asynchronous memory copy if applicable to overlap computation and data transfer
