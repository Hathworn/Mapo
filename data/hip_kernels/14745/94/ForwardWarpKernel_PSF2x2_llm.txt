```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by restructuring data if possible
// Reduce atomic operations by accumulating results in shared memory before writing to global memory
// Investigate using half-precision floats if precision allows to reduce memory bandwidth
// Preload data into shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Check occupancy to ensure maximum efficiency and consider adjusting block size if necessary
// Utilize async copy operations to overlap computation and data transfer if applicable
