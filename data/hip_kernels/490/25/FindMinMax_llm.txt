```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Increase the size of shared memory arrays if there are more than 128 threads per block.
// Ensure that the data loading from d_Data to shared memory is optimized for memory bandwidth.
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_xor_sync for faster reduction within a warp.
// Investigate reducing the number of __syncthreads() calls to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Explore using loop unrolling techniques to reduce iteration overhead in the reduction phase.
// Assess the possibility of minimizing redundant calculations and branches within the kernel.
