```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache d_Data values for better memory access patterns.
// Consider using float2 or float4 for coalesced memory access.
// Ensure constant memory is used effectively by loading d_ConstantA and d_ConstantB into registers or shared memory.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
