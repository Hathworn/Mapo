```
// Use memory coalescing to optimize global memory access patterns.
// Ensure that d_Result, d_Data1, and d_Data2 are aligned to reduce bank conflicts.
// Consider using float2 or float4 to load/store data to further optimize memory throughput.
// Investigate utilizing shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory transactions.
// Adjust block dimensions to improve the occupancy and balance between computation and memory access.
