```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache 'minmax' values for improved memory access efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring memory accesses to shared memory are coalesced
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the number of variables and optimizing variable usage
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data to shared memory before use
// Reorganize data to better utilize memory access patterns and minimize global memory transactions
