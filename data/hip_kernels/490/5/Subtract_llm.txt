```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where applicable
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce instruction overhead
// Check if using float4 rather than float offers performance benefits
// Profile the kernel to identify any remaining bottlenecks and focus optimization efforts there
```
