```
// Consider coalesced access for d_Data by adjusting data layout
// Ensure pitch for d_Data matches pitch alignment requirements
// Utilize shared memory effectively by ensuring enough shared memory is allocated
// Opt for loop unrolling for the data loading loop if compiler does not automatically
// Optimize synchronization by minimizing __syncthreads() calls when possible
// Use warp-level primitives if applicable to reduce synchronization overhead during reduction
