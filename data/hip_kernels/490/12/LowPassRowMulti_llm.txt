```
// Load data in coalesced memory access pattern for improved performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for kernel and data.
// Prefetch data to avoid waiting for memory access during computation.
// Minimize warp divergence by using min/max for boundary checks.
// Align shared memory allocation to ensure full memory coalescing.
// Consider unrolling loops to reduce overhead and improve throughput.
