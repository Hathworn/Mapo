```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize coalesced access pattern for loading data into shared memory
// Ensure all threads participate in the synchronization using __syncthreads()
// Minimize divergent branching by checking colStart < width outside loops
// Load kernel coefficients into registers for faster access
// Align shared memory size for optimal memory access in coalesced fashion
// Use loop unrolling techniques for convolution calculations
