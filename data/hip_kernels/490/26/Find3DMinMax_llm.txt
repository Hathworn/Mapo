```c
// Consider consolidating shared memory declarations into structures for better alignment.
// Use double buffering technique to overlap computation and memory access within loop.
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed small data like d_ConstantA.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead as the loop size is known.
// Align shared memory arrays to warp size to reduce bank conflicts.
// Optimize the number of syncthreads calls by minimizing conflicting accesses.
// Try to adjust loop boundaries or tile sizes to fully utilize thread block resources.
// Examine the possibility of using half-precision or other optimizations if precision allows.
