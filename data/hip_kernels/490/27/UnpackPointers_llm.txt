```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and avoid race conditions
// Optimize loop unrolling to improve performance and reduce loop overhead
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal access patterns
```
