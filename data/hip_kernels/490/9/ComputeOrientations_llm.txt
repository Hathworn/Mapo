// Leverage shared memory to reduce access times to global memory
// Use atomic operations to avoid race conditions in shared memory updates
// Preload frequently used values into shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data to warp boundaries when possible
// Consider reorganizing data structures to increase coalesced memory access
// Reduce divergent branches among threads to improve memory access efficiency
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed necessary operations before next steps
