```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for g_Data1, g_Data2, and g_Data3.
// Ensure that warp divergence is minimized in control flow conditions where possible.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory latency.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead.
// Optimize instruction-level parallelism to avoid pipeline stalls.
