```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses when loading data into shared memory to reduce global memory transactions.
// When precomputing Gaussian values, ensure that memory access patterns are optimized for shared memory bank conflicts.
// Optimize boundary checks to minimize divergent branches.
// Consider using compiler flags or built-in functions for fast math to potentially improve computation efficiency.
// Ensure that __syncthreads() calls are minimized to only where necessary for synchronization.
// Explore possible loop unrolling in histogram accumulation to improve performance.
// Assess the potential for using warp-level shuffle operations to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate if the histogram smoothing can be parallelized to further leverage concurrent execution.
// Consider reducing redundant calculations within critical sections to save computational resources.
