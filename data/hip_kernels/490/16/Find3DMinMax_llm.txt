```
// Optimize memory coalescing for global memory loads and stores.
// Consider minimizing divergent control paths in the kernel.
// Evaluate using half-warp based loop unrolling to reduce branching.
// Align shared memory accesses to minimize bank conflicts.
// Preload thread-independent data to avoid redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize use of shared memory to reduce pressure and increase occupancy.
// Explore the use of vectorized data types to increase memory throughput.
// Ensure memory accesses are bounded and within valid range to avoid segmentation faults.
