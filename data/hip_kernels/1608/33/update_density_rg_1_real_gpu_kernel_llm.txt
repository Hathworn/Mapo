```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by checking data alignment
// Minimize usage of global memory by utilizing shared memory if appropriate
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data for cache benefits
// Ensure __restrict__ pointers are used to inform the compiler of no aliasing
// Optimize math operations by utilizing appropriate hardware functions
// Balance block size and grid size to maximize occupancy
