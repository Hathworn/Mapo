// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory efficiency.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for this kernel.
// Ensure veff__ array is read from global memory as efficiently as possible.
