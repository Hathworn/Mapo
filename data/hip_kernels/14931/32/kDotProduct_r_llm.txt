// Use shared memory to store partial results to reduce global memory access
// Ensure efficient memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Employ warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for efficient intra-warp reduction
// Reduce global memory writes by storing the accumulated result in shared memory first
