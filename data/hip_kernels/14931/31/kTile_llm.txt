// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses in the mapping from source to target.
// Evaluate if vectorized operations can be applied to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures to enhance memory access efficiency.
