```
// Preload data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory arrays for histograms
// Ensure shared memory is synchronized after loading data
// Use atomic operations to handle concurrent histogram updates
// Normalize memory access patterns by clamping index boundaries
// Reduce divergence in thread computations by consistent branching
// Use atomicAdd to avoid race conditions during histogram update
// Perform boundary value checks for safe memory operations
// Ensure all threads in the block synchronize after writing data
