```c
// Consider coalesced global memory access for d_Data and d_Result to improve memory throughput.
// Use padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses if necessary.
// Group threads for more efficient loading to maximize the use of shared memory.
// Increase number of registers used per thread to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Ensure memory alignment in global memory accesses to optimize performance.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust the number of threads per block for maximum efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling in the convolution computation for potential speedup.
// Balance compute-to-memory ratio by adjusting shared memory usage as needed.
