```
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations when reading input data.
// Consider aligning shared memory sizes with warp size for better memory access patterns.
// Use temporary variables to minimize repeated calculations, which reduces latency.
// Move calculations outside conditional branches to avoid divergent warps.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers in kernel parameters to provide more optimization hints to the compiler.
// Reduce bank conflicts by padding shared memory arrays if necessary.
