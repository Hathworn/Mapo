```
// Use shared memory to store data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure warp-aligned memory accesses where possible to maximize coalescing.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring memory accesses are as linear as possible in shared memory.
// Reduce shared memory usage by optimizing access patterns, especially during histogram calculations.
// Consider loop unrolling in sections with fixed iteration counts to improve performance.
// Inline the computation for Gaussian values to avoid unnecessary repeated calculations.
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead.
