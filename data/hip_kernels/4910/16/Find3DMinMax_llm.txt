```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses with warp boundaries.
// Minimize shared memory usage by optimizing memory allocation and accesses.
// Use loop unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism and reduce overhead.
// Avoid redundant memory operations by caching previous results where possible.
// Use __syncthreads() strategically to synchronize threads only when necessary.
// Consider vectorization of memory operations to improve throughput.
