// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Implement boundary checks with clamp functions to ensure valid memory reads
// Replace conditional loads with branchless programming if possible
// Consider loop unrolling for the computation of 'sum' to fully utilize the pipeline
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring proper alignment
