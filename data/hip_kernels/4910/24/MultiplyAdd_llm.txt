```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for d_Data.
// Ensure d_ConstantA and d_ConstantB are loaded into registers.
// Align memory accesses to cache line boundaries for better performance.
// Minimize register pressure by reusing variables when possible.
// Consider loop unrolling if there are repetitive computations.
