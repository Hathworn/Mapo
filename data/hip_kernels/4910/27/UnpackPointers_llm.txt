```
// Consider increasing the use of shared memory for larger blocks of minmax values to improve memory access coalescing.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access by possible padding techniques.
// Ensure w (width) is a multiple of the warp size to fully utilize coalesced memory accesses.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to only necessary synchronization points to reduce overhead.
// Consider employing loop unrolling techniques on smaller loops like 'for (int k = 0; k < 32; k++)' for performance gain.
// Evaluate the benefits of prefetching data from global to shared memory to further optimize memory usage.
// Aim to modify the kernel launch configuration, if possible, for optimal thread block sizes to best match hardware architecture.
