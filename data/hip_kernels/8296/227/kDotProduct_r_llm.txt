```
// Use loop unrolling to reduce looping overhead and improve efficiency.
// Ensure data access patterns reduce bank conflicts by aligning shared memory access.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads effectively in parallel reduction.
// Optimize reduction with loop unrolling to minimize warp divergence.
// Use volatile in the last warp to force correct order of memory accesses.
// Align memory operations to maximize coalesced access and reduce memory access latency.
// Minimize grid dimension to balance workload across blocks efficiently.
