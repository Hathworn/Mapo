```
// Use coalesced memory access for Y, dY, and dX to improve memory throughput
// Consider using float2 or float4 for vectorized memory operations to further optimize memory access
// Align shared memory access for reduction_buffer to avoid bank conflicts
// Reduce global memory access latency by caching frequently accessed variables in registers
// Ensure efficient block size selection to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency
