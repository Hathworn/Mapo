```c
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses by reordering threads or data
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Consider using __restrict__ to avoid unnecessary memory aliasing
// Enable loop unrolling for the outer loop explicitly for better performance
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory latency
// Optimize block size and grid size for maximum occupancy
// Align data structures to enable faster memory access
