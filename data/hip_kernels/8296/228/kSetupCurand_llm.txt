```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data if multiple threads access the same data
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in memory
// Reduce global memory accesses by using registers for frequently accessed variables
// Use __restrict__ pointers to allow for additional compiler optimizations
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
