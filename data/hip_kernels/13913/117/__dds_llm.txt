```
// Use dynamic shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Calculate work range per block to balance workload
// Use coalesced memory access for efficient global reads
// Align memory access patterns for A and B to maximize throughput
// Store intermediate results in shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Perform reduction in shared memory to reduce latency
