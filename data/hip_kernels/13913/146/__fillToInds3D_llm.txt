```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache I, J, K arrays if reused frequently
// Ensure B array is accessed coalesced for better memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branching by uniformly applying conditional logic
// Use loop unrolling if the number of iterations is known to be small and fixed
// Evaluate if additional blocking or grid strategy adjustments could yield better performance
