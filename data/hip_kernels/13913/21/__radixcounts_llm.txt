```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory operations
// Use fewer atomic operations by reducing contention through workload balancing
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts to improve performance
// Ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions in shared memory usage
// Evaluate the possibility of using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
