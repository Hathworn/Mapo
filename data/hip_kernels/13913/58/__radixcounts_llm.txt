```c
// Reduce memory access latency by using shared memory efficiently
// Use atomics wisely to avoid memory contention and reduce overhead
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and efficiency
// Minimize divergent execution paths for enhanced warp efficiency
// Use strided access pattern for better cache utilization
```
