```
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Use shared memory to cache indices `I`, `J`, `K`, `L` for re-use by multiple threads
// Consider minimizing divergent branches by restructuring if conditions
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are chosen to fully utilize GPU resources
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism if possible
