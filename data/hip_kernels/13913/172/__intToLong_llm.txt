```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access
// Evaluate the thread block size to improve warp efficiency
// Experiment with different grid sizes for optimal performance
// Employ additional loop unrolling if beneficial for larger arrays
