```cpp
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory accesses
// Use shared memory to store intermediate calculations and reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure memory accesses are contiguous to minimize latency
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming to enhance efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Use vectorized loads if possible for improved performance
