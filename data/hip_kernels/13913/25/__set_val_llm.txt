// Ensure global memory access is coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Optimize block size and grid configuration for better occupancy
// Use thread block dimensions that are multiples of warp size for efficiency
// Align data structures to improve memory access performance
// Evaluate usage of __restrict__ to optimize pointer aliasing
