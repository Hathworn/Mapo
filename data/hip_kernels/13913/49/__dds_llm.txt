```c
// Use dynamic shared memory to reduce global memory access overhead.
// Unroll j loop to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Use local variable for shared memory indexing to improve memory access pattern.
// Implement loop unrolling in reduction to optimize throughput.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before sum reduction.
