```
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring coalesced global memory accesses.
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory usage.
// Check if the index calculations can be optimized to reduce register usage.
// Ensure that the grid and block configurations are optimal for the hardware.
// Explore the possibility of loop unrolling for improved performance.
// Verify that the kernel is launched with sufficient threads to utilize GPU fully.
