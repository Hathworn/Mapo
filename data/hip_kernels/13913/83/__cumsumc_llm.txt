```
// Use shared memory more effectively by minimizing global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling to maximize instruction throughput.
// Optimize shared memory allocation by aligning data types appropriately.
// Reduce synchronization overhead via more efficient data handling.
// Minimize conditional branches to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Evaluate block and thread configurations for memory coalescing benefits.
