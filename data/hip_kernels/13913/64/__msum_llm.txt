```
// Optimize memory access patterns to leverage coalesced global memory access.
// Consider using shared memory to cache the data from A and B used in the inner loop.
// Limit the number of blocks to ensure that data fits into shared memory for each block's usage.
// Prefer avoiding branch divergence within warps by ensuring threads within a warp follow identical execution paths.
// Use loop unrolling for the inner loop iterating over 'd' to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are chosen based on hardware architecture for optimal occupancy and performance.
