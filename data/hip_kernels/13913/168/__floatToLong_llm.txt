// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced by using stride pattern
// Use explicit cast to improve code readability and prevent implicit type conversion issues
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
// Consider accessing data in chunks to utilize shared memory if beneficial for larger data sets
