// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure B and I are allocated in global memory for persistent access.
// Minimize divergent branching for optimized performance.
// Evaluate shared memory usage to cache frequently accessed data.
// Optimize thread block size to match architecture-specific warp size.
