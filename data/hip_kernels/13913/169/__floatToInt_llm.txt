```
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider using vectorized loads if float data is 4-byte aligned.
// Utilize coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring memory access pattern is optimal.
// Minimize thread divergence within warp for efficiency.
