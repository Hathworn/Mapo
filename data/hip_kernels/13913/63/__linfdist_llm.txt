```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses for A and B
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data accesses for matrices A and B
// Ensure that the lda, ldb, and ldc parameters support memory coalescing
// Use loop unrolling techniques to reduce the overhead of loop control for 'i' loop
// Verify if reducing the loop unrolling factor can lead to better warp utilization
