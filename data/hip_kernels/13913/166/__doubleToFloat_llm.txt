// Consider coalescing memory access to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if the data can fit
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous memory copy for overlapping computation
// Investigate memory access patterns for potential bank conflicts
// Use compiler flags to explore vectorization and loop unrolling options
