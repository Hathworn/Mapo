```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by arranging data and threads to align accesses
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned for optimal throughput
// Try using prefetching to hide global memory latency
```
