```
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern where possible
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and cache utilization
// Minimize divergent code paths to improve warp execution efficiency
// Utilize shared memory if beneficial for repeated data access
// Ensure proper alignment in memory addresses for improved throughput
