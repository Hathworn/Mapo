```
// Consider coalesced memory access for matrices A, B, and C to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to cache B elements accessed within the loop to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure that lda, ldb, and ldc are aligned to facilitate faster memory transactions.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enhance performance.
// Use float4 loads/stores if memory alignment permits for improved memory bandwidth.
