```
// Use shared memory to store submatrices of A and B to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for A and B to improve performance
// Employ loop unrolling techniques within the 'for' loop to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure computation of pow and abs functions are compiled efficiently, possibly using intrinsic functions
// Ensure threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations to utilize memory throughput efficiently
