```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring that threads access data without striding.
// Explore using texture memory for data that is frequently accessed, as it may improve cache hit rates.
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
