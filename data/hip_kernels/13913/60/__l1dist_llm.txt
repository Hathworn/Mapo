```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Implement shared memory usage to reduce global memory accesses within the loop.
// Preload data into shared memory to minimize access latency from global memory.
// Optimize thread block dimensions to maximize occupancy and balance memory loads.
