```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and avoid bank conflicts
// Align the shared memory array size to a multiple of the warp size to avoid bank conflicts
// Use a flattened grid loop to optimize global memory coalescing
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Use a similar optimized loop for writing back the transposed data
// Ensure memory accesses are within bounds to prevent out-of-range access
