```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Attempt to coalesce memory access for improved performance.
// Use __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access patterns.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied to reduce loop overhead.
// Consider precomputing index mapping outside the loop if possible.
