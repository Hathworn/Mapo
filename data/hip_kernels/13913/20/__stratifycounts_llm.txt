```
// Consider aligning data to improve coalesced memory accesses.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory transactions.
// Apply loop unrolling to minimize instruction overhead and increase efficiency.
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized or replaced to reduce serialization.
// Reorganize data layout to improve memory access patterns and bandwidth.
// Use the first warp cleanup optimization to set shared memory.
// Consider pre-loading frequently accessed data into shared memory.
// Opt for minimizing divergence with logical operations.
// Leverage grid-stride loops to accommodate various problem sizes.
// Employ __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
