```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for matrices A and B
// Coalesce memory accesses for matrices A and B to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider using loop unrolling for the reduction in the for-loop to enhance performance
// Minimize the use of pow and fabs functions by manual handling if possible
