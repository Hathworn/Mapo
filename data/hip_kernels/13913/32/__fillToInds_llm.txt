```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for B and I
// Consider using shared memory to store indices I for improved access times
// Minimize frequent memory accesses by caching A in a register
// Consider vectorizing access to B if possible to take advantage of memory bandwidth
// Optimize block and grid sizes for specific GPU architecture for better occupancy
