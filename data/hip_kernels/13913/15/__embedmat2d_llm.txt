```
// Consider using shared memory to cache subsets of data for threads in a block to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses when loading data from global memory to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Align data structures and access patterns on natural boundaries for improved memory bandwidth utilization.
