```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for loading matrix A and B to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store partial results or frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergent branches to ensure that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Tune the block size to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient resource usage
// Evaluate loop unrolling for the inner loop to enhance instruction-level parallelism
