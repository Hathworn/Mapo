```c
// Use shared memory to load data from A and B tiles to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for the accumulation loop for performance enhancement.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading A and B matrices to maximize memory throughput.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to provide the compiler with optimization opportunities.
