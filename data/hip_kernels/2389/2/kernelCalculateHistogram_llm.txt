// Consider using shared memory for histogram to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced access by aligning data accesses with warp size.
// Optimize atomic operations by batching updates within a loop before committing to global memory.
// Utilize warp-level synchronization to minimize thread divergence.
