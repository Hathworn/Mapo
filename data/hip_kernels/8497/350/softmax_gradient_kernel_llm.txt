```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for dY and Y to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize vectorized loading/storing, such as float4, to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Minimize __syncthreads usage by employing warp shuffle operations for intra-block reductions.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques within for loops to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized to reduce bank conflicts and improve access latency.
