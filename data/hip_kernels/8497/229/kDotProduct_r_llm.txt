```
// Use coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Consider larger block size for more efficient parallel reduction
// Align shared memory access to reduce bank conflicts
// Use __restrict__ keyword for a, b, and target pointers to improve compiler optimizations
// Ensure gridDim.x * DP_BLOCKSIZE is a multiple of numElements for optimal performance
// Opt for warp-level primitives if available for reduction
