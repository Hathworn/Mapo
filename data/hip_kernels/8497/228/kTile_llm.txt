```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access performance
// Load data into shared memory in a coalesced manner
// Ensure __syncthreads() is called after loading into shared memory
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to hide memory latency
