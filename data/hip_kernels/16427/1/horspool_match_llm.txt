// Consider using shared memory for shift_table to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning text_start and pat_len with warp size
// Eliminate warp divergence by restructuring conditionals where possible
// Try prefusing loops to decrease loop overhead and improve instruction level parallelism
// Minimize memory bank conflicts within shared memory access
// Use half-warp optimizations for improving memory throughput in atomic operations
