```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Minimize global memory accesses by using registers for temporary data storage
// Ensure kernel launches maintain occupancy by balancing block size and thread count
// Use proper alignment for hiprandState to optimize memory bandwidth
