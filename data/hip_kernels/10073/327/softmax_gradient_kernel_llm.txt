```
// Consider loading Y and dY into shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Use const __restrict__ qualifiers for input pointers to aid compiler optimizations.
// Investigate using cooperative groups for more efficient warp-level reductions.
// Ensure alignment of pointers Y, dY, and dX to improve memory throughput.
// Adjust blockDim.x to match a multiple of warp size for full warp utilization.
