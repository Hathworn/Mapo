// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring data accessed by consecutive threads lies in consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate thread block size to improve warp efficiency and minimize divergence
// Limit the use of atomic operations in global memory to avoid serialization and improve parallel execution
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to reduce instruction overhead and enhance throughput
