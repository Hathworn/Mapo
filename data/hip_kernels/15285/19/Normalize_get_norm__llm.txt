```
// Use loop unrolling to reduce control overhead and increase throughput
// Consider prefetching data to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better global memory efficiency
// Minimize redundant calculations within the loop
// Implement shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
