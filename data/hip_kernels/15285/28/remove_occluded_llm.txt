// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling to potentially enhance loop performance.
// Assess the potential impact of reducing conditional branching on warp execution efficiency.
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
