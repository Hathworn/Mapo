// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth efficiency
// Use shared memory to cache data when possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp efficiency
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Evaluate the use of float4 operations for better throughput
