```cpp
// Evaluate condition before accessing memory to reduce unnecessary memory operations
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and minimize global memory access
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow a similar execution path
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
```
