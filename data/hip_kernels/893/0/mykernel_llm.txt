```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Use shared memory where possible for frequently accessed data
// Minimize global memory access by using registers for temporary variables
// Utilize warp shuffle operations to reduce the need for shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable within bounds
