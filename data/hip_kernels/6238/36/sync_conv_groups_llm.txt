// Consider using shared memory to optimize data access patterns and minimize global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives for fine-tuned synchronization instead of block-level sync.
// Assess memory coalescing to improve memory access efficiency among threads.
// Investigate potential use of asynchronous memory operations to hide memory latency.
