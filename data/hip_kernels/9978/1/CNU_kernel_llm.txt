```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Minimize global memory accesses by leveraging shared memory
// Use registers to reduce the number of reads from global memory
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure global memory accesses are aligned for optimal throughput
// Investigate the possibility of loop unrolling for performance
