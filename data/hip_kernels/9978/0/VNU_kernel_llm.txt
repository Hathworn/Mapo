```
// Use external shared memory for faster access compared to global memory
// Calculate current_Index to prevent repeated computation within the kernel
// Load offset into shared memory to avoid accessing global memory multiple times
// Ensure all offsets are loaded before computation using __syncthreads
// Utilize direct thread indexing to optimize memory bandwidth utilization
// Condensed sign determination to minimize branching
