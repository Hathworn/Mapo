// Consider combining multiple memory accesses into a single transaction to reduce latency.
// Look into using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Examine memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Align data structures to prevent misaligned memory accesses.
// Utilize vectorized loads and stores to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Investigate occupancy metrics; try optimizing register usage to improve them.
