```
// Ensure TILE_WIDTH is appropriately chosen to maximize SM utilization.
// Use coalesced memory accesses for global memory reads and writes.
// Consider adjusting TILE_WIDTH to match warp size for better performance.
// Prefetch global memory to shared memory efficiently to reduce latency.
// Evaluate bank conflicts within shared memory accesses.
