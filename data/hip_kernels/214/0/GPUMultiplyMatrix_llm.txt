```cpp
// Use shared memory for accessing matrix columns to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling to further optimize the for loop.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when accessing matrix elements for increased bandwidth.
// Evaluate if the use of warp-level primitives can improve performance.
// Avoid excessive use of __syncthreads() as it may introduce synchronization overhead.
