```
// Utilize shared memory to mitigate global memory access latency
// Prioritize initialization of shared memory to minimize global memory traffic
// Ensure threads process distinct portions of data to enhance parallel efficiency
// Leverage shared memory for intermediate histogram data collection
// Perform block-level reduction in shared memory to consolidate partial results
// Atomic operations on global memory should be minimized and batched after reduction
