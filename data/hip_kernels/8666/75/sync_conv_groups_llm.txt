```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy
// Use vectorized operations if applicable to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory and optimize layout
