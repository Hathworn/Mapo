```cpp
// Use shared memory to store blocks of input data for reuse
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory
// Use loop unrolling within each warp for more efficient memory access
// Rearrange loops to ensure writes to global memory are coalesced
// Prefetch data to reduce latency
// Ensure stride accesses are minimized to improve memory throughput
```
