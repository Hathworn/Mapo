```
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data to reduce global memory access
// Consider optimizing the thread block and grid size for better occupancy
// Use loop unrolling on scale_factor loops for potential performance improvement
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Minimize register usage by optimizing memory access patterns and operations
