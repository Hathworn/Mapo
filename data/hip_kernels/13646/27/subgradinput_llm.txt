```
// Consider using shared memory to cache weight values to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations
// Explore increasing the block size to maximize occupancy and use of available GPU resources
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimal and avoid non-coalesced accesses
// Prefetch gradOutput data into shared memory if possible to speed up subsequent accesses
// Use loop unrolling for the innermost loop to reduce the loop overhead and increase performance
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory by careful data arrangement
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to help compiler optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure that the loop variable ky in the outer loop is aligned with warp size for better efficiency
