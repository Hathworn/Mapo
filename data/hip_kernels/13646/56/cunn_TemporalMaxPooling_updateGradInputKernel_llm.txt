```
// Consider using shared memory for indices_data to reduce global memory access
// Pre-load gradOutput_data into shared memory to optimize memory access
// Optimize loop with unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access for gradInput_data by redesigning data layout if possible
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergence for atomic operations
