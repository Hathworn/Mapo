```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency 
// Ensure optimal memory coalescing for global memory reads and writes
// Consider unrolling loops to minimize loop control overhead 
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead 
// Verify that bank conflicts are avoided when accessing shared memory 
// Align data size and thread block size with the warp size for execution efficiency
