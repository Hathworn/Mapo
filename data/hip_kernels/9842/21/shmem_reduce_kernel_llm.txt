```
// Use coalesced global memory access when loading data into shared memory to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a power of two for optimal performance in the reduction loop.
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() calls to decrease synchronization overhead.
// Consider loop unrolling for the reduction loop to potentially enhance performance.
// Use appropriate block size to balance between occupancy and performance for the specific GPU architecture.
