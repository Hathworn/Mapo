```
// Consider coalescing access to d_coordinates to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store intermediary values of d_g and d_b for reduced global memory access
// Employ loop unrolling for the nested loops to enhance performance
// Use warp-level synchronization to optimize access patterns within a block
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for d_g and d_b if access patterns meet criteria
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for efficient memory transactions
