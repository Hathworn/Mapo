```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing for more efficient memory access
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions for intra-warp communication
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve performance
// Explore using prefetching to hide memory latency
