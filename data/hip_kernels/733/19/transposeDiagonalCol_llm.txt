```
// Consider coalesced memory access by using shared memory to buffer input data.
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Use __ldg for read-only input data to take advantage of cached reads.
// Assess block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Bench test different block size configurations to improve performance.
// Consider the use of vectorized loads/stores for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure aligned memory access to maximize throughput.
