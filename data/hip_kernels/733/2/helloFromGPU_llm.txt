```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory to cache data if reading the same data multiple times
// Minimize the use of global memory by leveraging local or register memory
// Consider thread block size optimization for better GPU occupancy
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal access performance
