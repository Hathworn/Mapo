```cpp
// Avoid redundant calculations by precomputing blockOffset and indices ti and to
// Use unrolling to increase memory access efficiency
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by aligning blockDim.x with memory boundaries
// Minimize conditional statements within kernel to improve performance
```
