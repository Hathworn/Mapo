```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Use shared memory if possible to further improve memory access times
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to reduce pointer aliasing overhead
// Verify if using warp shuffles could improve performance for this specific operation
// Ensure that the launch configuration (blocks and threads) matches the hardware for optimal occupancy
