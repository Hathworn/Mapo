// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures properly
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to enhance performance
// Optimize kernel launch configuration for hardware architecture
// Minimize divergent branches to increase warp execution efficiency
