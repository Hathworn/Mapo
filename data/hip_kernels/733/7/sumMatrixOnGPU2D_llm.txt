```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for frequently accessed data
// Explore the possibility of using vectorized types (e.g., float4) for efficient memory access
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap computation with data transfer if applicable
