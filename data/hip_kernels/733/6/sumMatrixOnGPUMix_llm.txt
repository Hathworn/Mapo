// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing for better performance
// Consider using float2 or float4 data types for vectorized operations
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring warp-wide execution paths
// Adjust block and grid dimensions for optimal resource utilization
