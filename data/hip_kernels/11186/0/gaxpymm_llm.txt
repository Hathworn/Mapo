```
// Consider coalesced access for array a by transposing it
// Use double buffering technique for shared memory usage
// Adjust block size to fit the shared memory size limit
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls by combining loops if possible
// Align shared memory allocation size to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize reduction by unrolling the loop for stride accesses
// Analyze if combining multiple kernel launches into one improves performance
