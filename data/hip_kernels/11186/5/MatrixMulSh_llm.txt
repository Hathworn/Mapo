```
// Use shared memory for efficient data loading to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure synchronization after loading tiles to prevent race conditions.
// Accumulate product results using registers to minimize access to slower memory.
// Synchronize after computation to allow safe loading of new data into shared memory.
// Optimize loop unrolling for TILE_WIDTH to improve computational throughput.
