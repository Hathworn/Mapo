```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced when reading from global memory into shared memory.
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to maximize the occupancy.
// Align shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize loop unrolling or consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization.
