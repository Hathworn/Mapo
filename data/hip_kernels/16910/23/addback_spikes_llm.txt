```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Increase coalesced memory access patterns by optimizing data layout
// Experiment with kernel configuration to balance between occupancy and latency
// Use constant memory for frequently used parameters if they do not change per kernel call
// Reduce divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow similar code paths
