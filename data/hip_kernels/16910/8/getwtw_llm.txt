```
// Convert to int using a more optimal method
// Increment by blockDim.y for better utilization
// Prefetching data into shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Consider using vectorized types to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize redundant calculations within the loop, such as calculating index
// Use unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and improve memory coalescing
