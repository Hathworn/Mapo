```
// Load data into shared memory efficiently
// Use atomic operations with shared memory to reduce global memory writes
// Optimize loop and use early exit on condition
// Use local_counter for atomic operation to reduce contention
// Exit early if condition is met to save computation
// Efficiently combine local counters into global counter
