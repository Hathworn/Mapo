// Consider using memory coalescing for accessing the data array to reduce global memory access latency.
// Preload more data from global memory to shared memory to minimize redundant accesses.
// Optimize the calculation of indices to avoid unnecessary computations inside the loop.
// Ensure aligned memory access to global memory for iC and iW to improve bandwidth.
// Reduce synchronization overhead by reviewing the necessity of __syncthreads within the kernel.
