```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory accesses for better performance.
// Use warp-level operations to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to improve cache efficiency.
// Ensure shared memory usage aligns properly with hardware limits to avoid bank conflicts.
// Utilize explicit loop unrolling to potentially improve arithmetic intensity and throughput.
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers for potential compiler optimizations.
// Evaluate constant memory utilization for frequently accessed values to reduce memory latency.
// Minimize the reuse of shared memory by optimizing data life cycle within the kernel.
