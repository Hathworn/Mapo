```
// Consider increasing data loading coalescence in shared memory by adjusting tid calculations.
// Analyze memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Avoid redundant loading by ensuring each data element goes into shared memory just once.
// Use an appropriate loop unrolling factor to balance between optimization and register usage.
// Balance the shared memory usage with available resources to prevent overconsumption.
// Evaluate if additional prefetching strategies could further hide global memory latency.
// Minimize conditional statements within performance-critical loop constructs.
