```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for frequently accessed data.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use register variables for frequently accessed values within each thread to reduce memory bandwidth.
// Optimize the loop by unrolling it if the value of Nspikes is known at compile time.
// Investigate the potential for using atomic operations if thread contention on nsp[tind] occurs.
