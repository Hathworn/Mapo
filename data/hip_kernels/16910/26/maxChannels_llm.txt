```
// Unroll loops to improve instruction-level parallelism and reduce branching
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditional checks
// Optimize memory access patterns, ensure data is coalesced when accessed
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses if applicable
// Consider loop interchange to improve cache locality
```
