```c
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing memory accesses.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to minimize global memory latency.
// Use loop unrolling judiciously to reduce overhead and branching.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reductions to minimize global memory access.
// Evaluate register usage and modify to prevent potential register spilling.
