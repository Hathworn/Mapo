```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently used data and reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in bigArray.
// Utilize vectorized memory access if applicable to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that data types (double vs. float) are used consistently as required by precision needs.
// Evaluate aligning data structures to improve memory access patterns.
// Minimize branching within warps to prevent warp divergence.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to improve instruction-level parallelism.
