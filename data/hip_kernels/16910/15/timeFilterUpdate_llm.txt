```
// Use shared memory for W to reduce global memory access latency.
// Unroll loops to improve performance by reducing control dependencies.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded the necessary data.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to minimize latency during kernel execution.
