```
// Use shared memory to cache match and cmax entries for improved memory access locality
// Align shared memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling for the filter iteration loop if Nfilters is known and repetitive
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses for Params, match, iC, call, and cmax arrays
// Evaluate if warp-level primitives can optimize reduction operations (e.g., finding max_running)
