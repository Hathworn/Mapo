```
// Consider using shared memory to load Wh values for each thread block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement double buffering technique to overlap data loading and computation for cmax.
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive access to mus by loading mus[tid] only once per thread.
// Ensure that the iMatch boolean checks are efficiently coalesced to minimize warp divergence.
// Align Nspikes, Nfilters, and Nchan memory accesses to cache lines to enhance transaction efficiency.
// Optimize thread block size to ensure the highest possible occupancy given the hardware constraints.
