```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Unroll the loop to improve instruction-level parallelism and reduce loop overhead
// Avoid writing back unnecessary results to global memory to reduce memory traffic
