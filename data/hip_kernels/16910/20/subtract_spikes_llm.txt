```c
// Optimize loop with stride approach for better parallel execution
// Use shared memory to further optimize access to W and U
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like x
// Ensure coalesced access patterns when accessing dataraw
// Use warp-level primitives for potential further optimization
// Consolidate memory accesses to minimize global memory transactions
```
