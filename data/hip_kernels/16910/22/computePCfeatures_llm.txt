// Optimize usage of shared memory to reduce access latency
// Ensure memory coalescing for global memory access
// Use bank conflict avoidance strategies in shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for frequently executed loops
// Use __ldg() for read-only data from global memory to exploit L1 cache
