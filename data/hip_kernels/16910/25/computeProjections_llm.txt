```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling for small fixed-size loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Preload frequently accessed data into registers whenever possible.
// Ensure optimal block and thread configuration to maximize occupancy.
