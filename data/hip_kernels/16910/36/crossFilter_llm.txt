```
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage to increase data reuse and reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate if the size of shared memory arrays can be reduced based on the specific usage scenario.
// Investigate if more threads can be utilized for loading data into shared memory to enhance coalescing.
// Analyze loop unrolling within the nested loops to reduce loop overhead and potentially optimize performance.
// Check alignment of global memory accesses to ensure coalesced memory transactions.
