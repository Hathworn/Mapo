```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like call[bid]
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for uproj array
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring early exits in the loop
// Experiment with loop unrolling for the loop over Nspikes
// Balance the use of atomic operations to minimize serialization
// Ensure optimal occupancy by adjusting block and grid dimensions
// Evaluate the usage of registers per thread to prevent register spilling
