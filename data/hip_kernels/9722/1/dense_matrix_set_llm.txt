```
// Consider using shared memory for frequent data reuse to reduce global memory access.
// Align data access patterns for coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Minimize conditional branches inside the kernel to improve execution efficiency.
// Increase block size to maximize use of available threads and improve occupancy.
// Use asynchronous memory copies and kernel launches for overlapped execution.
