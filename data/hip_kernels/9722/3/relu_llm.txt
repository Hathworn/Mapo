// Consider using shared memory to cache elements of A to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved global memory throughput.
// Evaluate the launch configuration to maximize occupancy and resource utilization.
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance by minimizing loop overhead.
