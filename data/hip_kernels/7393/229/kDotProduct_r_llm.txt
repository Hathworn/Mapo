```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory bandwidth
// Optimize thread block synchronization with __syncthreads() at key stages
// Unroll loop in block reduction to reduce thread divergence
// Use volatile to prevent compiler reordering on warp-level reduction
// Accumulate results in registers for faster processing
// Ensure efficient memory access patterns by coalescing loads
```
