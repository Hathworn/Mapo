```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() by restructuring computation for better warp utilization
// Reduce shared memory allocation by optimizing shared memory usage
// Ensure data alignment for optimal performance
// Consider loop unrolling for computation inside kernel function for reduced overhead
