// Consider using cooperative groups for more efficient synchronization.
// Explore using a larger shared memory size if array size changes.
// Reduce divergent paths by aligning threads to stride boundary.
// Ensure proper alignment for the atomic operations to avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate buffer size to minimize global memory access and maximize shared memory use.
// Investigate reduction techniques to further optimize shared memory updates.
