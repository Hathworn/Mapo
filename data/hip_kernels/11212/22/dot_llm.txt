```cpp
// Consider increasing data reuse by loading chunks into shared memory.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning data structures.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to hint at no aliasing.
// Optimize the loop unrolling factor to balance between compute and memory access.
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same path.
// Prefer using float4 or float2 to leverage vectorized loads for better memory throughput.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Test different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for the specific GPU architecture.
