// Use dynamic shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Perform parallel reduction with shared memory to efficiently combine results
// Ensure synchronization using __syncthreads() to maintain data integrity
// Store block-level results in global memory to facilitate further reduction
