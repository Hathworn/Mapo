// Use shared memory for histogram bins to reduce global memory access
// Minimize atomic operations in global memory by using shared memory
// Reduce global memory contention by accumulating in shared memory first
// Utilize shared memory to buffer atomic updates to the histogram
// Ensure synchronization when updating shared memory to prevent race conditions
