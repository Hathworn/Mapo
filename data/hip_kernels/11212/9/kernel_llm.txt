```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branching within threads to maintain optimal performance
// Align data structures to facilitate coalesced memory accesses
// Adjust block size and grid size to maximize occupancy and performance
