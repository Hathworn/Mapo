```cpp
// Consider reducing register usage by optimizing variable storage
// Load shared memory outside of condition to reduce __syncthreads overhead
// Check if sh_fx and sh_fy can be computed in parallel or outside of if condition 
// Optimize pointer access pattern for coalesced memory access
// Evaluate use of float precision to minimize computational overhead
// Consider reducing shared memory usage by recalculating in registers if needed
// Use smaller shared memory size if not all threads require access
