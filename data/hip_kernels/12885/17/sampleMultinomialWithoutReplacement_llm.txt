```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency when reading distribution arrays.
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing reads from `origDist` and `normDistPrefixSum`.
// Ensure `dest` memory writes are coalesced for efficiency.
// Evaluate if using warp shuffle operations can optimize the binary search function.
// Minimize the usage of global memory by caching frequently used values in registers.
// Consider using atomic operations for updates to `origDist` if required by the logic.
