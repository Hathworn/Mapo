```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid conflicts and ensure efficient bank access.
// Use loop unrolling where appropriate to decrease loop overhead.
// Minimize and align global memory accesses to reduce latency and increase throughput.
// Evaluate the possibility of using texture memory for constant data accesses.
