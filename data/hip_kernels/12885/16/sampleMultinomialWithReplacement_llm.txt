```
// Use shared memory to cache random numbers and reduce global memory access.
// Perform binary search for categorization using cached prefix sums to reduce repetitive memory reads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for writing results to global memory.
// Leverage warp-wide synchronization with __syncthreads() to coordinate shared memory access.
