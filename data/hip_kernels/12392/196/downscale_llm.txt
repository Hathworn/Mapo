```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for gradOutput_data
// Align memory accesses to 64-byte boundaries for better performance
// Utilize warp-level primitives to optimize reduction in loop
// Ensure loop unrolling is optimal to maximize instruction throughput
// Prefetch gradOutput_data to reduce latency during loop operations
