```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access latency
// Use more threads to increase parallelism and decrease the impact of latency from division operation
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory when reading and writing the accuracy variable
// Implement loop unrolling if repeated operations are present for potential instruction-level parallelism
// Optimize the division operation as it is computationally expensive, possibly using approximate methods if acceptable
// Consider using a different data type for accuracy if precision allows to minimize memory bandwidth usage
