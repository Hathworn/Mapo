```
// Consider coalesced memory access by adjusting data layout to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Explore the use of shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory, ensure that threads access different memory banks
// Reduce redundant calculations by precomputing values outside of loops where possible
// Optimize thread block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and workload distribution
