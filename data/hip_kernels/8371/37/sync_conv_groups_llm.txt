```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to enhance memory throughput.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts for improved performance.
// Use __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce memory access latency.
// Optimize the usage of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization.
// Align data structures to memory boundary for efficient memory transactions.
