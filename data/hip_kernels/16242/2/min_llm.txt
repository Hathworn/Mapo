```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if multiple threads access the same data
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for U, d, and minOutEdges arrays to enhance memory throughput
// Ensure global memory accesses are aligned to meet the hardware's memory requirements
// Avoid using conditional statements inside loops or frequently executed paths to reduce branching divergence
// Explore loop unrolling where applicable to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
