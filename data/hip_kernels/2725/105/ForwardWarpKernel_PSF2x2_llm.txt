```
// Use shared memory for flow and image data to reduce global memory accesses
// Combine multiple accesses into a single coalesced access pattern when possible
// Reduce divergence by simplifying conditional checks inside the loops
// Explore loop unrolling to optimize memory bandwidth and execution time
// Consider double buffering technique to overlap computation and memory access
