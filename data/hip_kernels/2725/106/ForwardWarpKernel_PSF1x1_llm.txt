```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within each block
// Coalesce global memory accesses by organizing data layout for better spatial locality
// Reduce divergent branches caused by boundary checks if possible
// Verify if bank conflicts are minimized when using shared memory
// Optimize atomic operations by reducing their frequency or using advanced atomic functions
// Ensure that usage of constants is optimized to leverage read-only cache
