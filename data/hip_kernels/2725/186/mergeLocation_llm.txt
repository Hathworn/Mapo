```
// Consider using shared memory to cache loc_ data within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring loc_ and output arrays x, y are accessed in a contiguous manner.
// Evaluate if launching more threads per block (considering occupancy) would improve performance.
// Check if loop unrolling beyond a single iteration could further optimize warp efficiency.
