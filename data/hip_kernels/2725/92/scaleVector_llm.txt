```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads require the same data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider reducing the usage of global memory and leverage registers for frequently accessed variables
// Ensure that the kernel launch is configured with an appropriate number of blocks and threads for optimal occupancy
// Use appropriate data alignment to enhance memory access efficiency
