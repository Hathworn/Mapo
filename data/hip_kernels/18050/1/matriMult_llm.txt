// Consider using shared memory to store tiles of matrices m and n to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure proper memory alignment and coalescing for efficient global memory access.
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize occupancy and reduce memory latency.
// Utilize loop unrolling to further optimize computation within the kernel.
// Use constant memory for storing kernel-specific parameters if applicable to minimize memory access overhead.
