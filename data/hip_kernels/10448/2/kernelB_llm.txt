```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for threads within the same block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider vectorized loads and stores if data alignment permits to increase memory throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergence by organizing computation so that threads within a warp take the same execution path.
