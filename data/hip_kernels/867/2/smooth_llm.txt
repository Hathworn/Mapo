```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by checking alignment.
// Use loop unrolling if possible to optimize throughput for repetitive operations.
// Ensure efficient use of registers to avoid spillover to global memory.
// Consider using float4 type for memory access if data alignment allows.
