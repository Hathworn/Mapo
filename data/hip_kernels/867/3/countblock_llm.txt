// Ensure coalesced memory access for ptr_in and ptr_out by aligning data structures.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce memory access latency and maximize bandwidth.
// Minimize divergent threads by optimizing index calculations to achieve uniform execution paths.
// Implement loop unrolling for thread-specific computations to improve execution speed.
// Investigate vectorized instructions to process multiple data elements per thread for improved performance.
