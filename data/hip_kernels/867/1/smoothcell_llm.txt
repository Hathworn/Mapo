// Consider optimizing shared memory allocation by reducing its size if not all values are used.
// Use warp shuffle operations for left and right neighbor calculations to reduce __syncthreads overhead.
// Minimize global memory writes by buffering output in shared memory before final write.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for both input and output arrays to improve memory bandwidth usage.
