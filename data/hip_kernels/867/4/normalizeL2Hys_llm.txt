```
// Optimize memory accesses by using coalesced memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring aligned access
// Consider loop unrolling for the sum of squares to enhance performance
// Pre-compute constants like rsqrt(sum) + L2HYS_EPSILONHYS * 30 for efficiency
// Utilize warp-level primitives for intra-warp reduction if applicable
// Ensure grid stride loop is implemented for larger data sizes
// Monitor and minimize divergent threads in the kernel
