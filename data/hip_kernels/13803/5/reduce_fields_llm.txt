```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning d_rho, d_Ex, d_Ey, and d_Ez arrays
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize to ensure correctness after loading to shared memory
// Accumulate values in shared memory to optimize reduction
// Use warp synchronous programming for small size reductions
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement in the reduction loop
// Write reduction results from shared to global memory only from a single thread
