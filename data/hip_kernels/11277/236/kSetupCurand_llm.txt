```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for better memory throughput.
// Reduce the number of memory transactions by aligning data structures and using vector loads/stores.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to match the GPU's architecture for better occupancy and performance.
// Precompute repeated expressions outside of loops to save computational resources if applicable.
