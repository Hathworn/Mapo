```
// Consider using data prefetching techniques to hide memory latency.
// Align data accesses to cache line boundaries to improve performance.
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing data more coherently.
// Evaluate the benefits of using float4 for coalesced data access.
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Unroll the loop completely if the iteration count is known to be small.
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce the need for shared memory synchronization.
// Opt for atomic operations if applicable to handle reductions in parallel execution.
// Consider splitting the kernel if register pressure is too high.
