```
// Consider using shared memory for gradOutput_data to improve memory access speeds
// Minimize indexing overhead by precomputing indices outside the inner loop
// Reduce global memory accesses by accumulating values in a register
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for improved throughput
// Analyze warp divergence and schedule threads to reduce it
