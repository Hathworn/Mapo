```
// Consider implementing warp synchronous reductions for efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce overhead.
// Explore reading Y and dY into shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Use float4 operations where possible to optimize vectorized memory transactions.
// Evaluate the impact of block size on memory access patterns and occupancy.
// Investigate if loop unrolling for small dims can enhance performance.
