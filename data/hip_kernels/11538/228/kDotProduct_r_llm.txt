```
// Ensure coalesced access for memory reads in a and b
// Consider using static shared memory for shmem definition
// Use __restrict__ pointers for a, b, and target to improve memory access
// Optimize loop by reducing number of syncthreads calls in reduction
// Use warp shuffle operations for parallel reduction within the warp
// Apply loop unrolling to further optimize reduction process
