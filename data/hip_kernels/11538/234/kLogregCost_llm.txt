```
// Consider coalesced global memory access for probs to improve memory bandwidth efficiency
// Use shared memory to cache maxProbs and reduce redundant global memory reads
// Minimize the use of __logf by pre-computing and caching frequently used values
// Use warp shuffle functions to reduce divergent branches when calculating numMax
