```
// Optimize for coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Reduce memory latency by using shared memory if the data can be reused within the block
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce the need for shared memory in some computations
// Utilize asynchronous memory copies to overlap data transfer and computation
// Minimize register usage to allow for more threads per block and higher occupancy
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce latency by overlapping computation and memory access
