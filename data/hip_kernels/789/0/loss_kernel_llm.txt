```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance.
// Optimize memory access by aligning data structures to avoid uncoalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as user factors and biases.
// Minimize the divergence in control flows within the kernel.
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques to reduce memory latency.
// Implement loop unrolling for the factors calculation to improve throughput.
// Explore using warp shuffles to optimize reductions within a warp.
