// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning input array properly
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by padding shared memory if necessary
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Optimize for occupancy by adjusting TPB (threads per block) and grid size
