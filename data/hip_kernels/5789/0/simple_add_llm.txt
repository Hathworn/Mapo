```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for both arrays a and b for optimal performance
// Ensure that a and b are aligned to 32-byte boundaries to achieve best memory access patterns
// Maximize the use of L1 cache by promoting data locality and minimizing memory divergence
// Investigate using a shared memory buffer to reduce global memory bandwidth usage if beneficial
