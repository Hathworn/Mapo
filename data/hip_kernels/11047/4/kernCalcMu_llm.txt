```
// Consider using coalesced global memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Cache common expression results to reduce repeated calculations within the kernel.
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() is minimized or optimized to lower synchronization costs.
// Evaluate the necessity of shared memory based on the 'pointDim' size for efficiency.
// Ensure memory accesses and computation are performed in parallel within a warp.
