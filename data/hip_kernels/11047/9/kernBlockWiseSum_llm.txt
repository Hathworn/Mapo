```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from global memory for `dest`
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce redundant synchronization
// Utilize warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Prefer smaller block sizes for better load balancing on some architectures
// Choose an optimal blockDim.x size that is a power of 2 for efficient reduction
