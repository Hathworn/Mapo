```
// Consider using shared memory to store sumexp and bias if accessed frequently
// Minimize global memory access by maximizing use of registers
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data from global memory
// Avoid bank conflicts if shared memory is implemented
// Utilize warp-level primitives for reduction if applicable
