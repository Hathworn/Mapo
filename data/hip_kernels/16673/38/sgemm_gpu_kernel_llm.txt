// Use shared memory to cache sub-matrices from A and B to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing to ensure that threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce thread divergence in the computation loop
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous data transfers to further overlap computation and memory access
