// Consider increasing the block size for better occupancy
// Use vectorized loads to improve memory coalescing
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits for optimal performance
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls if possible
// Align data structures to 32-byte boundaries to enhance memory access efficiency
