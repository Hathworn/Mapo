```
// Use conditional assignment to prevent unnecessary global memory access
// Unroll loop to optimize computational efficiency
// Use shared memory for data access to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure synchronization after each update to maintain data consistency
// Leverage block-level reduction for minimal global memory writes
```
