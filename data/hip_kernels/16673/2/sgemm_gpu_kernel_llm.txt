```
// Consider optimizing memory accesses by using coalesced reads from global memory
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure that shared memory is utilized to its full potential to cache reusable data
// Consider using loop unrolling for the loop over K for better performance
// Verify the shared memory size and bank conflicts to ensure optimal access patterns
