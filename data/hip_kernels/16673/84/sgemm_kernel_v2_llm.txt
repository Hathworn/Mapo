```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory coalescing
// Ensure data is accessed in a coalesced manner to maximize bandwidth
// Consider padding shared memory to prevent bank conflicts
// Align data structures to cache lines to reduce cache misses
// Investigate use of vectorized loads to accelerate memory operations
// Adjust BLOCK_DIM for optimal occupancy and memory bandwidth usage
