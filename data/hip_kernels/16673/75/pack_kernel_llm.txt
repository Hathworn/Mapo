```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring d-input, d-output, and d-predicates are in coalesced memory order
// Cache read-only data like d_predicates and d_scanned using __ldg() for better memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for d-scanned if it can fit within the shared memory limits to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure address calculations minimize divergence in memory access patterns
