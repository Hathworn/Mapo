// Use shared memory to optimize memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for global memory reads and writes
// Reduce thread divergence by minimizing conditional statements
// Optimize reduction loop by using bitwise operations for stride calculation
// Only synchronize threads if necessary to reduce overhead
