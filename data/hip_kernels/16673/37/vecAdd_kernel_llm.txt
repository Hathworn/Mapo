```
// Use shared memory if frequent read/write operations are needed
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data in contiguous memory
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Minimize register usage to prevent spilling to local memory
// Use warp shuffle operations for fast data exchange between threads
// Profile memory bandwidth to identify bottlenecks and improve kernel launch configuration
