```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure data dependencies are respected using __syncthreads().
// Optimize memory coalescing for A and B accesses.
// Tile size should match warp size to maximize efficiency.
// Consider preferring large block sizes for better occupancy.
