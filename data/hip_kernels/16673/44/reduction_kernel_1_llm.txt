```
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Prefer using float4 instead of float for coalescing global memory access
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to improve memory access patterns
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations
// Ensure data is loaded in a coalesced manner to optimize global memory throughput
// Apply warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
