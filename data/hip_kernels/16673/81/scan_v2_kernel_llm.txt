```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for d_input and d_output
// Minimize use of __syncthreads to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency
// Avoid unnecessary conditional statements to prevent thread divergence
// Opt for loop unrolling in forward and backward passes to enhance performance
