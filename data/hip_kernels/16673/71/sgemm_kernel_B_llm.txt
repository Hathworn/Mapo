```
// Consider using shared memory to store segments of A and B for faster access
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring coalesced access patterns for A and B
// Preload data into registers to minimize global memory read latency
// Ensure memory alignment for A, B, and C for efficient memory transactions
// Explore loop unrolling for the reduction operation to increase parallelism
// Minimize control divergence by maintaining uniform execution paths within warps
