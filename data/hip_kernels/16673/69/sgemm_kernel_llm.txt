// Consider using shared memory to store submatrices of A and B, reducing global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Evaluate unrolling the loop for better ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Utilizing half-precision floats could improve performance on supporting architecture.
