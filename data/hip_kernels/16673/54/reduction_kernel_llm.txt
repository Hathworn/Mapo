// Consider using loop unrolling in the accumulation loop for better performance
// Prefetch next data elements to reduce latency
// Use atomic operations to reduce synchronization overhead in the reduction phase
// Evaluate shared memory usage and reduce if possible for better warp occupancy
// Optimize number of blocks and threads to ensure maximum occupancy and balance between computation and memory access
