```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure data is aligned in memory for better access patterns
// Leverage shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using a larger unrolling factor if it fits into registers
// Test different block sizes to find the best configuration for your hardware
