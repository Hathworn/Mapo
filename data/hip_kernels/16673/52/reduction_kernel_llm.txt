```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure shared memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance.
// Optimize reduction using warp-level primitives to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads calls to reduce latency.
