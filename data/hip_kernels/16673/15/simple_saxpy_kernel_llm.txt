```
// Move memory-intensive calculations outside the conditional to reduce branch divergence.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure contiguous memory access patterns to leverage memory coalescing.
// Consider using vectorized operations for improved bandwidth utilization.
