// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure correct usage of __syncthreads() for synchronization after loading.
// Use threadIdx.x and threadIdx.y for shared memory indexing.
// Zero out shared memory elements outside valid range for boundary conditions.
// Calculate thread indices to avoid redundant operations on invalid data.
// Optimize loop for tiles to minimize redundant loads into shared memory.
// Avoid unnecessary computations for threads outside matrix bounds.
