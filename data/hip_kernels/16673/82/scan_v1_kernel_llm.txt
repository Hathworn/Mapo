```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for improved global memory efficiency
// Optimize the usage of shared memory by reducing unnecessary loads
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() to minimize thread divergence
// Analyze if loop unrolling can benefit the scan operation performance
// Adjust shared memory size dynamically to match block size for better resource utilization
