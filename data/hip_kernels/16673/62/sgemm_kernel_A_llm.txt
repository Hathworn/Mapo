```
// Unroll the loop to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for A and B to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider using shared memory to cache elements of A and B for fewer global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory stride by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use atomic operations carefully if necessary to ensure correct concurrent writes.
