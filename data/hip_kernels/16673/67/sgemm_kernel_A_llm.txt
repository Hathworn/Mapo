```
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Ensure optimal block size to maximize shared memory utilization and occupancy
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block after loading to shared memory
// Ensure that row and col indices are checked to prevent out-of-bounds access
// Consider loop unrolling to further optimize the computation within the inner loop
