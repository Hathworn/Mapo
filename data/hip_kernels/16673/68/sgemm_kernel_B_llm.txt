```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory access
// Ensure shared memory usage effectively hides global memory latency
// Overlap computations and memory operations as much as possible
// Adjust block size and tile dimensions based on specific hardware for optimal occupancy
// Consider use of loop unrolling to improve performance in the multiply and accumulate section
