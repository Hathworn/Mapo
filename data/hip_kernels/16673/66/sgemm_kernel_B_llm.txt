```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access time.
// Coalesced memory accesses for the B matrix with proper indexing.
// Optimize for row-major order to improve memory access patterns.
// Use registers to store repeated accesses to A and B elements within the loop.
// Explore block and thread configuration to maximize occupancy and performance.
