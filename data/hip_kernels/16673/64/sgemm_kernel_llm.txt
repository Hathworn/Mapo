```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache A and B sub-matrices to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved performance.
// Use loop unrolling to optimize the innermost loop for better performance.
// Evaluate using warp-level primitives like __shfl_xor for further optimization.
// Align memory access to leverage memory throughput.
