// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Shared memory can be leveraged for increased data reuse
// Ensure threads are synchronized after loading data to shared memory
// Accumulate results in shared memory to minimize global memory transactions
// Minimize write operations to global memory by using shared memory
