```
// Ensure a, b, and c are allocated in contiguous memory to improve access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to cache data when accessing a and b arrays
// Balance use of registers and memory bandwidth by optimizing index calculations
// Optimize the block size for better hardware utilization based on your GPU architecture
// Minimize divergent branching for the index boundary check
