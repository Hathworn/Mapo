```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access by loading data into shared_position
// Ensure threads synchronize after loading data to shared memory using __syncthreads()
// Avoid bank conflicts by using appropriate padding in shared memory, if necessary
// Optimize the loop to minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads execute similar instructions
// Consider using float4 instead of float3 for shared memory to align data and potentially reduce load/store time
