// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to global memory for efficient data transfer.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to potentially reduce loop overhead.
// Evaluate register usage to avoid spilling and improve kernel performance.
// Avoid redundant __syncthreads() where possible to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Analyze tile size (BLOCK_SIZE) for optimal performance based on hardware constraints.
