// Consider coalesced global memory access when writing to imageHistogram
// Use shared memory efficiently to avoid multiple atomic operations
// Consider using warp-level primitives to speed up calculations
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is correctly placed to prevent race conditions
// Optimize the use of texture fetches to reduce global memory bandwidth
