```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize memory throughput.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for float data types.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data within the loop.
// Minimize global memory accesses by fetching data into registers.
// Evaluate the block size and grid size for optimal performance.
