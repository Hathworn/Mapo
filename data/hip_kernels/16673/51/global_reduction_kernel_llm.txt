```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce the loop overhead
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using more efficient warp shuffle functions instead of shared memory for small reductions
