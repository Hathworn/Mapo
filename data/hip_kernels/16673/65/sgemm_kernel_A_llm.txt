```
// Optimize shared memory access patterns to maximize coalesced memory access
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits and avoid bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to minimize divergence and idle threads
// Check for any possible optimizations in memory alignment and access
// Evaluate the tiling strategy for optimal load balance and utilization
