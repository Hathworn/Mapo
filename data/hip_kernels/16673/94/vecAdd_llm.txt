```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data local to each block for faster access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and using sequential indices.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by properly aligning or padding shared memory data.
// Experiment with adjusting block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy and performance.
