```
// Consider coalesced global memory access for d_input and d_output
// Optimize shared memory usage further if filter size is large
// Expand loop unrolling where beneficial for filter access
// Ensure boundary conditions are handled efficiently
// Evaluate the balance between shared memory use and register spills
