```
// For memory access coalescence, ensure A and B arrays are accessed in a contiguous manner
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory transactions and increase reusability of data
// Consider using loop unrolling within the inner loop to improve computational efficiency
// Synchronize threads after loading tiles into shared memory to avoid race conditions
// Only write results back to global memory when necessary to reduce global memory access
