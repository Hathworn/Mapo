```
// Use shared memory if accessing poli[] results in significant memory contention
// Ensure data is coalesced by properly aligning poli[] in memory
// Consider using loop unrolling if N is known at compile time and is static
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by using padding if required
// Prefetch data into registers if additional computations are necessary
