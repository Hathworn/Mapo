```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring arrays are aligned in memory.
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated reads of data by threads in the same block to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure global memory access patterns are coalescent for higher memory throughput.
// Utilize __restrict__ qualifiers for input pointers to inform the compiler of no aliasing and enable better optimization.
