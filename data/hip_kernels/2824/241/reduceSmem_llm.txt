```c
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
// Utilize volatile keyword for warp unrolling to handle data dependencies.
// Ensure only tid == 0 writes back to global memory to prevent race conditions.
