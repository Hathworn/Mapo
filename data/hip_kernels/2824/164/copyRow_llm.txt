```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory if multiple threads need to access overlapping memory regions
// Opt for a larger block size for better occupancy, depending on hardware limits
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier if applicable
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
