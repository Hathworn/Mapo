```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Consider using vectorized data types (e.g., double2) to load/store multiple elements at once
// Align data structures to cache line boundaries to improve cache performance
