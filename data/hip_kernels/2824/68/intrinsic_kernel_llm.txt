```
// Consider increasing block size to improve occupancy and parallelism
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately to ensure all threads reach the same point
// Replace __powf with inline multiplication for potential performance gain
// Optimize global memory access by using coalesced memory patterns
// Ensure the 'out' pointer is aligned for efficient memory writes
