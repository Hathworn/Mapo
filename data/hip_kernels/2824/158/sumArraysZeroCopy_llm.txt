// Consider using coalesced memory access for A and B
// Optimize the block size to ensure all threads fill shared memory blocks efficiently
// Reduce conditional branching to improve performance
// Pre-fetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to prevent unnecessary synchronization overhead
