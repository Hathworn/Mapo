```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory for stencilWeight if repeatedly accessed across threads
// Check alignment for __ldg intrinsic use, ensure src and stencilWeight are aligned
// Minimize out of bounds checks by ensuring size and data access are well-defined
// Explore loop unrolling further if beneficial, based on profiling
// Consider data prefetching strategies for src to improve cache utilization
