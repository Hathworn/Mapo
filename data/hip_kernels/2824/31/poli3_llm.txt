```
// Precompute repeated expressions to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use shared memory if the data fits and if there are multiple accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling if beneficial, though it might not apply here.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// If possible, align data in memory to improve access patterns.
