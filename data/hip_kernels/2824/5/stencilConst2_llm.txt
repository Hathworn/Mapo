```
// Move stencil weights to shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Load stencil weights into shared memory before computation begins
// Synchronize threads to ensure all stencil weights are loaded before computation
// Unroll loop to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Use shared memory to store partial results for efficiency
```
