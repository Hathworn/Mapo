// Ensure coalesced memory access for A and B to maximize bandwidth.
// Consider aligning data structures for better memory access efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to minimize global memory loads.
// Optimize block and grid size configuration for maximum occupancy.
// Use loop unrolling techniques if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
