```
// Use shared memory to store tile data for better memory coalescing.
// Unroll loops to fully utilize the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.
// Load halo data into shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced access by storing intermediate results in shared memory.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after writing into shared memory.
// Optimize the usage of registers by storing frequently accessed data.
// Apply loop unrolling where beneficial to reduce loop overhead.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls by minimizing shared memory dependencies.
// Maximize work per thread to exploit fine-grained parallelism.
