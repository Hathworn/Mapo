// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use vectorization techniques to process multiple data elements in a single operation.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance.
// Minimize condition checks inside the kernel loop.
// Unroll the loop where applicable to reduce loop overhead.
