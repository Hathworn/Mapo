```
// Consider using shared memory for stencil weights if they are frequently accessed
// Prefetch data into registers before entering the loop to improve memory access coalescing
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Align data access to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
