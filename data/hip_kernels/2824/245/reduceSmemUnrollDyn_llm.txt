// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Apply loop unrolling to improve instruction throughput
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous indices in global memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before reducing  
// Utilize volatile keyword to prevent optimization issues within warps
// Reduce divergent branches by organizing warp-level operations carefully
// Write final result from the shared memory to global memory with minimal contention
