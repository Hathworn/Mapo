```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access efficiency and reduce global memory transactions
// Implement loop unrolling to minimize synchronization overhead and improve parallel reduction efficiency
// Utilize volatile keyword to enable warp-level primitives without explicit synchronization
// Consider adjusting the block size to optimize memory access patterns further
// Evaluate the trade-off between block size and shared memory usage for optimal performance
// Explore the possibility of using cooperative groups for more fine-grained synchronization control
