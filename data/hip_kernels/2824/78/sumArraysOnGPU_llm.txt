```cpp
// Use shared memory for A and B for coalesced memory access
// Ensure memory accesses are contiguous for better coalescing
// Consider using loop unrolling if the operation becomes more complex
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Check for potential memory bank conflicts in shared memory usage
