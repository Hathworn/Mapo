// Further coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using a loop unrolling strategy to reduce instruction overhead.
// Optimize memory bank conflicts within shared memory accesses.
// Evaluate if using atomic operations might improve performance under certain conditions.
// Analyze if using warp-level primitives can speed up reduction operations.
