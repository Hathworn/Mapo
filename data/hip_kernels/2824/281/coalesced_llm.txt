// Use shared memory to optimize coalesced memory access
// Ensure all thread memory loads are completed before proceeding with computation
// Shared memory usage minimizes global memory access latency
// Coalesced memory access can improve memory throughput and performance
// Memory operations within shared memory are faster than global memory operations
