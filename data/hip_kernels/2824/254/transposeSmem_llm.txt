```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Pad shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure boundary checks to prevent invalid memory access
// Load data into shared memory to optimize coalesced access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory
// Transpose indices calculation for efficient memory access
