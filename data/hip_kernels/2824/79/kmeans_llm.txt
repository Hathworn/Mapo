```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache centroids for faster access
// Unroll loops if applicable for better instruction-level parallelism
// Consider using float or double if more precision is needed to reduce rounding errors
// Ensure that atomic operations do not lead to significant contention, consider using warp-level primitives if feasible
```
