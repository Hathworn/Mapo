```c
// Use coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput.
// Minimize redundant accesses to global memory by using shared memory (already implemented).
// Consider increasing the unrolling factor beyond 4 if it aligns with hardware constraints and workload.
// Adjust the shared memory allocation dynamically to match the block dimensions, reducing unused memory.
// For warp unrolling, ensure bank conflicts in shared memory are avoided for peak performance.
// Replace "volatile" usage in warp unrolling with __builtin_assume_aligned if applicable for alignment optimization.
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure enough threads per SM for efficient resource utilization.
