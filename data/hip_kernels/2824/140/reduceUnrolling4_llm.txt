```
// Avoid redundant global memory accesses by using shared memory for intermediate computations
// Utilize warp-level operations to reduce synchronization overhead
// Minimize block synchronization to improve kernel performance
// Align memory access patterns to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for improved bandwidth utilization
```
