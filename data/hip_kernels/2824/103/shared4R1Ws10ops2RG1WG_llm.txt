```c
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory for coalesced access.
// Optimize memory access pattern to minimize bank conflicts.
// Use vectorized memory loads if possible to improve throughput.
// Reuse shared memory data across multiple operations if applicable.
// Investigate possible loop unrolling for threads working in a loop.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for better performance.
// Assess if additional shared memory is beneficial for larger data sharing.
