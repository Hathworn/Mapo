```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage to reduce synchronization overhead
// Implement warp-level primitives for intra-warp reduction
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could further enhance performance
// Ensure memory transactions are optimized for bandwidth
