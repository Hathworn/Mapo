```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for idata to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Prefer loading data into shared memory to reduce global memory transactions.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler with optimization.
// Consider occupancy tuning like adjusting the block size to better utilize GPU resources.
// Unroll more loops where possible for additional thread throughput.
// Ensure alignment for optimal memory transactions (e.g., adjusting the size of g_idata).
