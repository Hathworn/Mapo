```
// Consider using shared memory for reuse of data within the block.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same path.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve global memory bandwidth usage.
// Reduce arithmetic operations by reusing computed values where possible.
// Consider using constant memory for coefficients if frequently reused.
