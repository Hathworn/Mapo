// Consider coalesced memory access to ensure efficient memory transactions.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access within the kernel.
// Ensure minimal synchronization to prevent unnecessary warp divergence.
// Avoid boundary checks inside the loop to improve parallel execution efficiency.
