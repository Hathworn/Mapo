// Use `__restrict__` keyword to help compiler with memory access optimization
// Ensure all memory allocations have efficient alignment for coalesced access
// Consider prefetching data if there is significant latency in accessing A and B
// Investigate use of shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
