```
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for A, B, and C to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling if the operations inside the loop block are repetitive.
// Balance the number of threads per block and blocks per grid for optimal occupancy.
// Align data structures to 128 bytes for best memory access performance.
// Use constant memory for constants like 0.2 and 123.1 if they are rarely changed.
