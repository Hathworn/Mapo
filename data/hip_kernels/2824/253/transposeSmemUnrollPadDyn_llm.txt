```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and boost performance.
// Ensure all memory accesses to 'in' and 'out' arrays are coalesced.
// Load data unconditionally where possible to avoid branch divergence.
// Adjust boundary checks to reduce conditional statements, improving efficiency.
// Use dynamic shared memory allocation judiciously to maximize occupancy.
