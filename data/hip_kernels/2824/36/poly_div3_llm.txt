```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for poli array to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Implement shared memory usage if further computations or memory accesses show bank conflicts.
// Evaluate the occupancy and adjust block size or resources to maximize parallelism and minimize idle threads.
// Ensure that the compiler uses appropriate instruction-level optimizations for floating-point arithmetic.
