```
// Load stencil weights in coalesced manner for better memory efficiency
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed stencil weights to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure correct synchronization after loading stencil weights into shared memory
// Consider using constant memory for stencil weights if they do not change during kernel execution
```
