// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory access efficiency
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimal for GPU architecture
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency
// Experiment with different tile sizes for improved performance
