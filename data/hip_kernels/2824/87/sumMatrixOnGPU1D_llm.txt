```c
// Consider using shared memory for MatA and MatB to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by ordering threads such that consecutive thread IDs access consecutive memory locations
// Explore using memory prefetching techniques to load data into cache before it's needed
// Evaluate the benefits of using warp-level primitives for fine-grained synchronization and improved performance
