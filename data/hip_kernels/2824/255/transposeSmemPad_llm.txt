```c
// Ensure coalesced access in both read and write for improved memory efficiency
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Implement padding to avoid shared memory bank conflicts
// Minimize register usage by optimizing index computations
// Aim for optimal block and grid dimensions for best performance
// Consider occupancy and wavefront size for maximizing core utilization
