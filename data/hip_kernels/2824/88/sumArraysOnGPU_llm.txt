```
// Consider using shared memory for partial results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Pre-load data into shared memory to take advantage of memory coalescing.
// Use loop unrolling if the computation involves repetitive operations to minimize loop overhead.
// Check for memory bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance.
