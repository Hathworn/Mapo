```c
// Consider optimizing block size to utilize more threads concurrently
// Using shared memory effectively reduces global memory access latency
// Preload halo elements into shared memory to prevent bank conflicts
// Ensure proper synchronization to prevent race conditions
// Leverage thread parallelism by unrolling the loop for efficiency
```
