```
// Optimize memory access patterns by minimizing the number of global memory accesses.
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Use proper synchronization to avoid race conditions between threads.
