```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loading data from global memory to shared memory.
// Minimize branch divergence by aligning buffer index calculations.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the data loading loop to decrease loop overhead.
// Evaluate the block size to maximize occupancy and under-utilization of shared memory.
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring all memory accesses are coalesced.
