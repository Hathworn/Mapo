// Prefetch stencil weights to shared memory for faster access
// Adjust shared memory size to match stencil width for better memory usage
// Utilize __restrict__ keyword for pointer variables to improve compiler optimizations
// Apply #pragma unroll to loop for potential performance increase through loop unrolling
