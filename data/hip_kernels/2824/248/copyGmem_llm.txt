// Use shared memory to enable coalesced memory access patterns
// Introduce padding in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory access time
// Ensure threads remain within bounds to avoid undefined behavior
// Transpose data in shared memory for optimal memory access pattern
