```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing A and C arrays linearly
// Preload the B[i] variable into register to help reduce access latency
// Consider using shared memory for B if it's frequently accessed and fits in shared memory
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to increase throughput
```
