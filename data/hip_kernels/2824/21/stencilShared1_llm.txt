```
// Use coalesced memory access pattern when loading data into shared memory.
// Ensure shared memory is adequately sized and aligned for access efficiency.
// Implement early exit check to prevent unnecessary computations and memory accesses.
// Unroll loops to improve performance and reduce loop overhead.
// Adjust initial indexing to align data access with stencil operation requirements.
