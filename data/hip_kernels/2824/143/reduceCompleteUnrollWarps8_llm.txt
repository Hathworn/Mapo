```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads read contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses during the reduction.
// Leverage warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead and optimize within-warp reductions.
// Utilize all available threads by completely unrolling the reduction loops.
// Employ volatile keyword for within-warp reduction to prevent unnecessary memory reads/writes.
// Use only __syncthreads() when absolutely necessary to minimize synchronization penalty.
