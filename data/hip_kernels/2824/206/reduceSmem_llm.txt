```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for g_idata and g_odata to aid compiler optimization
// Explore the use of loop unrolling manually or using compiler hints for further reduction steps
// Investigate the impact of different block sizes on performance to ensure optimal occupancy
// Avoid excessive __syncthreads() by leveraging warp level operations where possible
// Ensure smem usage is within desired limits to avoid spilling into global memory
// Consider using cooperative groups library for more fine-grained synchronization
