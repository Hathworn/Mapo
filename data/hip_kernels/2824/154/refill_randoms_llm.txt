// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and accesses
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider reducing the number of reads/writes to global memory
// Explore the possibility of using warp-level primitives for optimization
// Minimize the divergence within warps to enhance performance
// Preload data into registers where possible to reduce memory latency
// Balance the workload to avoid idle threads within warps
// Analyze and adjust block size for maximum occupancy and efficiency
