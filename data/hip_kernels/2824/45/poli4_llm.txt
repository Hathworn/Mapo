```
// Use shared memory to cache data if there's reuse among threads
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by using contiguous data access patterns
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same path
// Consider using constexpr for constant values to avoid recomputation
// Use loop unrolling if possible to reduce loop control overhead
```
