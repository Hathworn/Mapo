```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses for src and dst arrays for better memory throughput
// Ensure idx calculation considers all possible thread and block configurations
// Apply loop unrolling for the stencil computation to enhance performance
// Preload stencil weights into registers if possible to reduce memory latency
