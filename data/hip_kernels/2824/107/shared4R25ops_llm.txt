```
// Minimize global memory access by loading data into shared memory efficiently.
// Precompute values that are used multiple times to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Group arithmetic operations to utilize registers and improve computation speed.
