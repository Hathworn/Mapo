// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory for temporary data storage to reduce global memory accesses
// Evaluate warp efficiency to ensure maximum utilization of GPU resources
// Use occupancy calculator to maximize the number of active warps and threads
