```c
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Optimize data access patterns to utilize coalesced memory reads.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronization.
// Balance the number of threads per block for optimal memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling to maximize instruction-level parallelism.
