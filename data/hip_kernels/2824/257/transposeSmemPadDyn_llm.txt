```cpp
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a pattern that minimizes strided access.
// Align shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts by using padding (IPAD).
// Perform boundary checks before accessing memory to avoid unnecessary calculations or errors.
// Utilize thread synchronization (__syncthreads()) to ensure all threads have loaded data to shared memory before any read/write operations.
