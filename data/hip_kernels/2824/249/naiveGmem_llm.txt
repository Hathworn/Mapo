// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts by padding shared memory
// Load data into shared memory in coalesced manner
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded
// Write back to global memory after transposing the data
// Ensure boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds access
