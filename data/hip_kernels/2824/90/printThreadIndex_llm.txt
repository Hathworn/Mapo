```cpp
// Suggest coalesced memory access patterns for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory load latency.
// Minimize the use of printf in device code for performance reasons.
// Ensure thread blocks are sized to maximize occupancy according to device architecture.
// Align data structures to warp size boundary for better performance.
