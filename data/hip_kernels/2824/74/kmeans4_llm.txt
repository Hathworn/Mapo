// Use shared memory to load centroids into cache for fast access
// Consider using coalesced access patterns for 'input' array
// Apply loop unrolling further in the 'distances' calculation for improved parallelism
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives for reduction in nearest centroid calculation
// Prefetch data into registers where possible to minimize global memory latency
