```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for improved memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Minimize redundant calculations by precomputing repetitive expressions
// Utilize registers to store temporary results for faster access
// Evaluate potential use of warp shuffle operations for further optimization
// Assess if loop unrolling can contribute to faster polynomial evaluations
