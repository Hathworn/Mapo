```
// Use float4 to reduce four-element vector operations to single instructions, optimizing coalesced memory access.
// Ensure memory allocation aligns with float4 operations to optimize memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory if repeatedly accessing the same elements within a block for improved memory efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling or other instruction-level optimizations for further potential speed increases.
// Verify memory access patterns to ensure alignment and coalescing for optimal memory bandwidth usage.
