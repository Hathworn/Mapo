```
// Utilize shared memory for coalesced global memory access
// Ensure shared memory usage aligns with warp size to avoid bank conflicts
// Precompute and store constants to minimize redundant calculations
// Load data into shared memory first to improve data locality
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Consider unrolling loops if divergence is detected
