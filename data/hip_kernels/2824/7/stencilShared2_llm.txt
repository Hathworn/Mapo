// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement bounds checking to avoid out-of-bound memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory elements to zero for safe out-of-bound handling
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded the data into shared memory
// Utilize pragma unroll to improve the loop performance
