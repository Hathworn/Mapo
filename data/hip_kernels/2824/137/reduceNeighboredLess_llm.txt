// Consider using shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to enhance memory throughput.
// Use bank conflict-free access patterns in shared memory.
// Optimize the number of active warps to best utilize hardware resources.
// Experiment with the block size to find the optimal configuration for your hardware.
