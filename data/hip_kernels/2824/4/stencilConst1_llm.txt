// Ensure memory coalescing for global memory access
// Align memory access to avoid bank conflicts
// Use shared memory if possible to further reduce global memory access
// Consider increasing the number of processing elements (threads per block) for load balancing
// Evaluate the possibility of using asynchronous memory copies for overlapping computations
