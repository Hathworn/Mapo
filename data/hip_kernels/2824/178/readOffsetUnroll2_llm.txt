```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure that data is aligned to reduce memory access latency
// Maximize occupancy by selecting appropriate block size based on GPU architecture
// Prefetch data into shared memory if it can reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to indicate no aliasing if applicable
// Assess if further unrolling could benefit performance based on GPU and data size
