// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a continuous manner
// Consider adjusting block size for better occupancy and memory throughput
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Experiment with different tile sizes to achieve optimal performance
// Check for alignment in memory accesses for reduced latency
