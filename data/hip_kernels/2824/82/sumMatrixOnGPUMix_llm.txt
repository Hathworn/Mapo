```cpp
// Ensure coalesced access by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory if there is data reuse across threads within the same block
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize bank conflicts
// Consider the use of vector loads if the memory is aligned and it enhances performance
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
```
