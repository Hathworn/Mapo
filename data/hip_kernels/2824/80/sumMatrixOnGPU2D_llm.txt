```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns in global memory access.
// Reduce shared memory usage if possible to lower shared memory bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if using float4 data type could improve memory throughput.
// Profile and adjust block and grid size for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Ensure boundary conditions are handled carefully to prevent out-of-bounds access.
// Double-check shared memory sizes to fit within hardware constraints.
