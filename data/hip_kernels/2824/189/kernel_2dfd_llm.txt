// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Unroll loops where possible to decrease loop overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access to enhance performance
// Balance the computation and memory access to achieve optimal GPU resource utilization
