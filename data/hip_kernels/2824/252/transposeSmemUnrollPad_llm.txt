```
// Use coalesced memory access to load and store data efficiently from and to global memory.
// Optimize shared memory access to minimize bank conflicts using padding.
// Consider unrolling loops further to maximize throughput by reducing loop overhead.
// Ensure shared memory synchronization after loading from global memory to avoid race conditions.
// Use conditionals to avoid out-of-bound memory access and to support matrices with sizes not divisible by block dimensions.
