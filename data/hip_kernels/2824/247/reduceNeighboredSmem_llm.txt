// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for g_idata by aligning array access patterns.
// Increase shared memory usage to reduce traffic from global memory.
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads() by minimizing its frequency and strategically placing it.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for your specific hardware.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize intra-warp reductions.
