```
// Use bitwise AND instead of modulo for better performance to access shared memory indices
// Ensure shared memory accesses stay within bounds using bitwise operations
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
