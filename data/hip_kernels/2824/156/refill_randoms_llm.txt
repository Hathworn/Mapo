```
// Use shared memory to store state if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce writes to dRand by ensuring contiguous threads write to contiguous memory locations
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores to improve memory throughput
// Increase occupancy by adjusting block size or using more lightweight data structures
// Experiment with loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
