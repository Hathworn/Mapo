```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to A and B if possible
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Evaluate if unrolling loops can further optimize performance, if loops are present
// Use constant memory for any invariant data to reduce redundant global memory accesses
