```
// Consider coalesced access patterns for A and B to optimize global memory accesses.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Pre-compute reused expressions outside of critical paths to reduce redundant computations.
// Ensure synchronization where necessary to prevent data hazards with shared memory.
// Optimize shared memory usage and avoid bank conflicts for efficient parallel access.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to enhance performance in computationally intensive sections.
