```
// Consider using a larger shared memory buffer for block-wide data caching
// Load multiple elements into shared memory to reduce global memory access within each block
// Utilize coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure synchronization barriers are matched appropriately to prevent race conditions
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to achieve optimal occupancy and performance
