```c
// Optimize global memory access by using grid-stride loops
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Consider optimizing block and grid dimensions for hardware
// Use shared memory as a buffer for intermediate calculations if needed
// Evaluate loop unrolling for further performance benefits
```
