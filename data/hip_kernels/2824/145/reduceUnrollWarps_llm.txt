```
// Optimize memory access using coalescing techniques.
// Unroll loops to reduce instruction count and improve performance.
// Minimize use of global memory to reduce latency.
// Implement warp-level synchronization to avoid serialization issues.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access overhead.
