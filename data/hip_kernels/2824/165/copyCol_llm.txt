```
// Consider using shared memory for coalesced memory access.
// Evaluate tiling the workload to better fit the GPU's memory hierarchy.
// Strive to minimize global memory accesses by leveraging data reuse.
// Optimize thread-block size for better occupancy and efficiency.
// Align memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
