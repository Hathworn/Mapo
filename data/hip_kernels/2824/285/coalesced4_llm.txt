```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data to potentially improve cache hit rate
// Balance workload among threads to ensure all threads in a warp are active
// Use float4 data type for coalesced memory access, which is already implemented
// Perform memory access with proper alignment to avoid bank conflicts
