```
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Optimize shared memory usage by loading block data into shared memory before processing if possible.
// Minimize memory transactions by aligning data accesses where possible.
// Consider using loop unrolling for better performance on vectorized operations.
// Ensure enough threads in a block to fully utilize the GPU's computing resources.
