```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Load data into shared memory with boundary checks
// Load halo regions in shared memory to avoid repeated global memory access
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded before computation
// Unroll loop to improve performance
// Ensure boundary conditions when storing results to global memory
// Consider using more threads per block for better occupancy
