```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to improve memory access times.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning the data layout with warp size.
// Preload data into registers if possible to minimize global memory access latency.
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing threads to follow the same execution path.
