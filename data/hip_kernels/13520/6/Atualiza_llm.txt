// Ensure that the shared memory is utilized fully by handling boundary conditions correctly.
// Coalesce global memory access by aligning loads to shared memory.
// Minimize global memory transaction by resolving bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Leverage shared memory effectively by pre-fetching required rows within bounds.
// Make sure to handle boundary conditions to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
// Synchronize threads properly to ensure consistent reads and writes in shared memory.
