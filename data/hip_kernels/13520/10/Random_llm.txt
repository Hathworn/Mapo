```c
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to potentially improve compiler optimizations.
// Optimize global memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses.
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Consider adjusting block size and grid size to maximize GPU utilization and hide latency.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit the performance by reducing loop overhead.
