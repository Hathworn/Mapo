```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for neighboring cell data
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring data accessed by threads in a warp do not map to the same bank
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns when loading data to or from global memory
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() as it introduces synchronization overhead
// Ensure memory footprint of shared memory matches block size to optimize usage and reduce latency
