// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access for neighboring elements.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize memory latency.
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure coalesced access to global memory.
// Consider tile-based approach to maximize memory locality and re-use.
