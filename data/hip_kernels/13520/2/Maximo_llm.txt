// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access by coalescing data reads and writes.
// Minimize memory access by loading data into shared memory only once per thread.
// Employ loop unrolling in the reduction step to improve performance.
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for better bandwidth utilization.
