// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for input array to maximize memory throughput.
// Use warp divergence reduction techniques to optimize the performance of reduction.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads by restructuring code logic, if possible.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
