```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for better performance
// Optimize memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler optimize memory loads
// Avoid using atomic operations inside heavily used loops if possible
// Consider splitting the kernel for different phases (finding max, calculating exp, summing)
// Minimize usage of __syncthreads() for better performance and reducing thread divergence
