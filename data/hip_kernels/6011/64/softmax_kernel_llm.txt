```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use __shfl_sync to reduce exchange overhead instead of shared memory where possible.
// Avoid divergent threads by ensuring all threads participate in warp-level operations.
// Use parallel reductions for sum computations to minimize time complexity.
// Minimize use of global memory by preferring shared memory for temporary storage and reduction.
