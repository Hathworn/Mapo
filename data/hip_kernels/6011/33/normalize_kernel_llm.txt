```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache mean and variance values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize grid and block configuration to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by structuring data appropriately.
```
