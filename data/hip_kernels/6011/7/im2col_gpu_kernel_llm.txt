```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if data reuse permits
// Consider loop unrolling if ksize is small and known at compile time
// Align data_col and data_im pointers to improve memory coalescing
// Launch kernel with appropriate block size to optimize occupancy
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
