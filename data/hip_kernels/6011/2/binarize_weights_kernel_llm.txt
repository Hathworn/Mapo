```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed weights for better memory access patterns
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring that all threads within a warp perform similar operations
// Analyze the possibility of loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Check for coalesced memory access patterns to maximize global memory throughput
