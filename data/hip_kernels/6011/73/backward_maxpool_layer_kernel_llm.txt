```
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by careful allocation of shared resources
// Align data accesses to 128-byte boundaries for better memory coalescing
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments to optimize memory access
// Use loop unrolling to eliminate unnecessary iterations and improve performance
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data access to improve cache hits
// Optimize index calculations to reduce computational overhead in loops
