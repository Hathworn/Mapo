```c
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Consider increasing the block size if the data allows, to improve occupancy
// Ensure all shared memory is utilized effectively to avoid wastage
// Consider refining memory access patterns to coalesce global memory access
```
