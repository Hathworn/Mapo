```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for improved memory access speed.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize divergent code paths.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling can reduce overhead in this simple kernel.
// Explore using atomic operations if accumulation is necessary in similar kernel designs.
// Profile memory access patterns to identify misaligned accesses for further optimization.
