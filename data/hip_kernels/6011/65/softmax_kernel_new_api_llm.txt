```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures properly
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for thread blocks
// Minimize use of global memory by computing within registers if possible
// Optimize instruction count by avoiding redundant calculations
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead where applicable
// Investigate potential warp divergence and optimize branching logic
// Align memory access to boundary requirements for optimal performance
// Use float2, float4 types if applicable for vectorized operations
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for hardware occupancy
