```
// Use shared memory to cache biases to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use float4 or other vectorized data types for coalesced memory access.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for the specific hardware characteristics.
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by adjusting block size according to the CUDA Occupancy Calculator.
