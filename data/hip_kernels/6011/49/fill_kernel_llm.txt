// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access overhead.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory accesses from threads.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to minimize shared memory use when applicable.
// Utilize vectorized memory access if applicable to increase data throughput.
