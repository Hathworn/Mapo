```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for input and binary pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Reduce the number of redundant calculations and memory accesses by caching data in registers.
// If the block size is not a multiple of warp size, consider using warp shuffles instead of shared memory for faster mean calculations.
// Ensure the occupancy is optimized by adjusting block size and shared memory usage to maximize resource utilization.
