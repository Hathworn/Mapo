```c
// Consider coalesced access to the 'x', 'mean', 'variance', 'mean_delta', 'variance_delta', and 'delta' arrays
// Reduce the bank conflicts by padding shared memory or changing access patterns if shared memory is utilized
// Ensure that 'variance' is not accessed redundantly by loading it once into a register
// Minimize shared memory usage by using registers whenever possible
// Use a loop unrolling technique for the loop iterating over elements if beneficial
```
