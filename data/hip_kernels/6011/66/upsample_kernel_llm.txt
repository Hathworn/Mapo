```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to increase memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data within threads
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access where possible
// Ensure data is accessed in a pattern that maximizes L2 cache hits
// Favor using warp-synchronous programming for better efficiency
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to avoid serialization and contention
