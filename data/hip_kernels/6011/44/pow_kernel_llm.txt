```
// Use shared memory to cache input data for faster access
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning INCX and INCY appropriately
// Prefer using float2 or float4 types for vectorized memory operations
// Minimize global memory access by loading data into registers
// Employ loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
```
