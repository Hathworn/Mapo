```
// Cohalesce global memory accesses by ensuring memory operations are aligned
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for frequently accessed data
// Minimize branching by reordering if statements to reduce divergent warps
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce latency for repeated accesses
