```
// Ensure input arrays X and Y are located in contiguous memory for coalesced access
// Align the allocated memory size to the nearest multiple of the warp size
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring the condition is uniformly met by all threads in the warp
// Use shared memory to temporarily store data if the kernel is memory bandwidth limited
