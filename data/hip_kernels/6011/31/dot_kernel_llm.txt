```
// Ensure the kernel is being launched with optimal block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy.
// Use shared memory to cache 'output' values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalescing the global memory accesses for 'output' and 'delta' to enhance memory throughput.
// Employ warp shuffle operations instead of atomicAdd for accumulating 'delta' if possible to reduce overhead.
// Double-check that #pragma unroll is effectively unrolling the loop to take advantage of instruction-level parallelism.
