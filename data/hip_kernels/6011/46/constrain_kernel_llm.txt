// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Minimize register usage by reducing complex expressions
// Ensure data alignment for improved memory access efficiency
// Optimize thread synchronization to minimize idle threads
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance
