```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, especially for frequently accessed data.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure data_col accesses are aligned to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize branching by structuring code to reduce conditional checks within loops.
// Evaluate loop unrolling techniques for the ksize loops to potentially increase performance.
