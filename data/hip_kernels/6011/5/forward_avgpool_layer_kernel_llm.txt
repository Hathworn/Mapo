```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for coalesced access.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce branch overhead in summation loop.
// Assess occupancy and potentially adjust block and grid sizes for optimal performance.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if applicable to provide compiler more optimization opportunities.
