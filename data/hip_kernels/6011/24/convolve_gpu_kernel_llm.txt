// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Reorganize data access patterns for coalesced memory access
// Consider using texture memory for spatial locality and faster access
// Replace floating-point operations with integer arithmetic where possible
// Use atomic operations to reduce synchronization overhead
