// Early exit to avoid unnecessary computation and memory access
// Accumulate in registers to reduce memory operations
// Consider shared memory for mean and variance if they are reused
// Use strided memory access pattern to improve cache efficiency
// Evaluate benefits of loop unrolling based on hardware and dataset
