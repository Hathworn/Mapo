```
// Consider coalesced memory access by reordering threads' memory access pattern
// Ensure that 'add' and 'out' arrays are accessed with contiguous threads for better cache utilization
// Minimize the use of atomic operations; try to redesign kernel to reduce contention
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results if possible, reducing global memory access
// Evaluate if 'sample' and 'stride' can be optimized or made constants for loop unrolling
// Reduce divergent branching by ensuring all threads in a warp take the same execution path
