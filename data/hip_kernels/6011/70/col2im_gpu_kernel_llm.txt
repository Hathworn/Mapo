// Consider using shared memory for data_col if size is manageable.
// Avoid excessive calculations within loops by pre-computing repetitive expressions.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads of data_col.
// Use loop unrolling for the innermost loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Align memory access to minimize unaligned reads and writes.
