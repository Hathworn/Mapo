```
// Combine memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Ensure arrays a, b, s, and c are appropriately aligned
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse can be achieved
// Minimize memory access latency by ensuring n is a multiple of the block size
// Evaluate the benefit of using warp-synchronous programming for reduction if applicable
// Opt for fewer branching conditions to reduce warp divergence
