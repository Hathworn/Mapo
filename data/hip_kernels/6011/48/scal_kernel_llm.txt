```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring X is accessed continuously
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if needed
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the specific hardware
// Consider using streaming loads for overlapping computation with memory accesses
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling benefits performance for this kernel
