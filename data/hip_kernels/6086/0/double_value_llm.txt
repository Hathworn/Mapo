```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure that data is coalesced into consecutive memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Check if 1024 can be dynamically passed as a parameter to support different sizes.
// Consider launching sufficient blocks to fully utilize the GPU's computational resources.
