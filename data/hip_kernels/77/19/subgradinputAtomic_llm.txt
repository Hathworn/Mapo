```
// Consider using memory coalescing for gradOutput and gradInput accesses.
// Explore shared memory usage to further reduce global memory accesses.
// Assess if atomic operations can be minimized or avoided for better performance.
// Investigate striding and access patterns to enhance memory throughput.
