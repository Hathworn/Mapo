```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache global memory data accessed multiple times.
// Align memory access patterns to achieve coalescing.
// Consider using float2 for loading and storing when applicable to increase memory throughput.
// Employ loop unrolling techniques if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
// Use half precision if accuracy allows to decrease data size and increase cache efficiency.
