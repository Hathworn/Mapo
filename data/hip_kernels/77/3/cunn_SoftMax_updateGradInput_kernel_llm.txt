```
// Consider using shared memory more efficiently by padding or aligning access patterns to avoid bank conflicts
// Use warp-level reduction techniques to minimize shared memory usage and synchronization overhead
// Reduce the number of memory accesses by leveraging caching and on-chip memory resources
// Optimize loop unroll strategies for better instruction throughput and reduced branching
// Balance grid and block dimensions to fully utilize the GPU resources while minimizing idle threads
// Ensure data blocks are coalesced to improve memory transaction efficiency
