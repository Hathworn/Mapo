```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring input_k and target_k are aligned
// Exploit shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure shared memory array is appropriately sized to prevent memory bank conflicts
// Consider padding shared memory to optimize access patterns
// Minimize __syncthreads() to ensure warp efficiency
// Utilize warp-level primitives for reduction to decrease synchronization overhead
// Align input and target arrays to maximize memory throughput
// Consider splitting large reductions into multiple smaller reductions to fit shared memory limits
