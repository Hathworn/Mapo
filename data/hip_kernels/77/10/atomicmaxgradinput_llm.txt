```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for gradInput, gradOutput, indices_x, and indices_y.
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal global memory access speed.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for indices_x and indices_y.
// Evaluate register usage to prevent register spilling, which can slow down performance.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring that all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
