```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Ensure optimal block size to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
// Consider loop unrolling for small fixed ntarget values to reduce overhead
