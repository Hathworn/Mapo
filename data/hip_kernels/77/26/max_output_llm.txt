// Unroll the loop further to improve performance and memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access by aligning data and minimizing bank conflicts
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to achieve better performance in calculating max values
// Exploit vectorized memory access if supported by the hardware for input and output arrays
