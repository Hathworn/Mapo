```
// Consider using shared memory to store a tile of gradOutput elements to reduce global memory accesses
// Align the memory accesses of ptr_gradInput and ptr_gradOutput for coalesced memory access
// Replace the divide operation in the inner loop with a pre-computed reciprocal to improve performance
