// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning accesses and reducing bank conflicts.
// Consider using more shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure loop unrolling is effectively used to reduce instruction overhead.
// Avoid redundant memory accesses by reusing loaded values where possible.
// Check for potential warp divergence and structure code to minimize it.
// Evaluate the benefits of cooperative groups or block-level shared reductions.
