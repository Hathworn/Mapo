// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Optimize shared memory usage for better cache efficiency
// Reduce branching by minimizing condition checks within the loop
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimal for the hardware
// Use __restrict__ keyword to hint that input arrays do not overlap
// Apply loop unrolling techniques to improve performance
