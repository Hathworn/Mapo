```c
// Align memory access patterns for coalesced memory access to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for indices_x and indices_y
// Optimize the grid and block size to maximize occupancy and minimize execution divergence
// Consider loading data into registers when appropriate to reduce memory latency
