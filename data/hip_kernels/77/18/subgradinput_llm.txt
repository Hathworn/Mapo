// Consider memory coalescing by using shared memory to reduce global memory transactions.
// Group consecutive memory accesses for gradInput to improve spatial locality and memory access efficiency.
// Precompute offsets for complex index calculations to reduce repetitive computations.
// Evaluate potential loop unrolling for the kernel height and width loops if computational resources allow for it.
// Minimize warp divergence by aligning work with warp-friendly execution patterns in conditions and loops.
