```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for both gradInput and gradOutput.
// Investigate the possibility of reducing the usage of atomicAdd to improve performance.
// Consider unrolling loops manually or using compiler pragmas to enhance loop execution efficiency.
