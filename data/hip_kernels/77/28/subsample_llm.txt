```
// Use shared memory to load input data in chunks to reduce global memory access.
// Align data to coalesced memory access patterns in ptr_input to improve performance.
// Ensure input data is accessed in a coalesced manner by threads in the same warp.
// Consider using atomic operations if needed to handle concurrent writes to output memory.
