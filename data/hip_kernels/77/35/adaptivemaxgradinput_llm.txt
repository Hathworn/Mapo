```cpp
// Align memory access to improve coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to cache 'indices_x' and 'indices_y' to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize by merging memory accesses for 'gradOutput', 'indices_x', and 'indices_y' where appropriate.
// Consider loop unrolling for further optimization of repeated memory accesses.
// Ensure all reads are coalesced to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce global memory access times.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by proper memory layout.
// Consider using vectorized loads if applicable for 'gradInput' updates.
