```cpp
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in global memory.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory load when accessing gradInput, gradOutput, indices_x, and indices_y.
// Minimize divergent threads by reordering calculations or using conditional statements efficiently.
// Pre-calculate commonly used expressions to reduce redundant calculations within threads.
// Consider using __ldg() or similar functions for efficient read-only memory access when applicable.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to improve memory access speed and performance.
// Review the block and grid size configuration to optimize for the specific GPU architecture being used.
// Apply loop unrolling techniques if applicable to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
