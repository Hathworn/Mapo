```
// Ensure memory coalescing for better memory access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data access
// Align memory allocations to improve memory operation efficiency
