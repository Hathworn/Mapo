// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure data alignment to leverage hardware capabilities
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for improved memory access patterns
