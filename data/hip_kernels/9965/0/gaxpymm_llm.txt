```cpp
// Use vectorized loads and stores for memory access to increase memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory for 'a' and 'b' tiles to further reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Reduce bank conflicts when using shared memory by padding shared memory allocations
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further optimize reduction operations
