```
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads require access to data to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if performing repetitive calculations within threads to optimize execution
// Avoid memory bank conflicts by aligning shared data appropriately
// Prefetch data into registers when possible to minimize global memory latency
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to prevent performance bottlenecks
