```
// Ensure blockIdx.y and blockIdx.z are not used if the grid is 1-dimensional
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Allocate shared memory efficiently by minimizing its size according to n
// Perform synchronization efficiently to avoid excessive barrier overhead
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to improve performance
// Maximize thread occupancy by choosing an appropriate block size
// Ensure y, a, and x are aligned to prevent uncoalesced access patterns
// Opt for in-register storage within threads to reduce global memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring access patterns align
// Re-evaluate the launch configuration for optimal grid size based on the input dimensions
