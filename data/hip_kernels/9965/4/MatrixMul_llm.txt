```
// Use shared memory to store tile portions of Md and Nd to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch data elements from Md and Nd into shared memory before computation
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing matrix elements in a row-major order
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting shared memory layout
// Consider loop unrolling within the for loop to enhance computational efficiency
