```
// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring dY, Y, and dX are accessed in a memory-friendly manner
// Use loop unrolling in the gradient computation for potential speed-up
// Use fewer shared memory accesses by optimizing the reduction process
// Try to reduce global memory access by retaining critical data in registers
// Ensure optimal block size to maximize occupancy without oversubscribing resources
