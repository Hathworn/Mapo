```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring data is coalesced.
// Consider increasing the work per thread to improve utilization.
// Align memory access patterns to exploit shared memory.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Minimize the use of global memory to reduce latency.
