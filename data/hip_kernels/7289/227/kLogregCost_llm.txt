```c
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Address bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Use shared memory to cache repeated global memory accesses.
// Optimize instruction-level parallelism by restructuring dependent calculations.
// Minimize warp divergence, especially in the branching section.
