```c
// Use shared memory for gradOutput_data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access for gradOutput_data during reads
// Consider using texture memory for gradOutput_data if data access pattern is random
// Align gradInput_data writes for coalesced memory access
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations in translate_idx_inv by pre-computing repeated terms
