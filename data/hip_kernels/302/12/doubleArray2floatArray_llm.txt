```
// Ensure proper memory alignment for doubleArray and floatArray
// Consider prefetching data to optimize memory access patterns
// Optimize block and thread dimensions for improved coalescing
// Investigate vectorized loads/stores for improved throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if applicable
// Perform loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
```
