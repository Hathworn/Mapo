```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for vec
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory transactions
// Reduce warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp execute the same code path
// Utilize occupancy calculator to determine optimal block size for full device utilization
// Employ loop unrolling for the reduction phase to decrease loop overhead
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to take advantage of cache
