```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for d_input_vector
// Optimize shared memory usage and ensure there are no bank conflicts
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the hardware architecture
// Evaluate the benefit of using warp-level primitives to optimize reduction further
// Minimize divergent threads within the loop for partial sum calculation
// If applicable, use memory prefetching techniques for d_input_vector
