```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for vec1 and vec2 to improve memory throughput.
// Consider splitting the kernel into multiple passes for larger numElements to avoid wasting threads.
// Optimize shared memory usage by padding to avoid bank conflicts.
// Implement loop unrolling in the reduction phase to reduce loop control overhead.
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for reduction to improve performance.
