```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, if applicable
// Minimize thread divergence to ensure all threads follow the same execution path
// Align memory accesses to 128 bytes where possible for optimal performance
// Optimize grid and block size configuration based on specific hardware for better occupancy
