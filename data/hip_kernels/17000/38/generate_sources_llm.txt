// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to improve execution efficiency
// Ensure memory alignment for better access patterns
// Use coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
