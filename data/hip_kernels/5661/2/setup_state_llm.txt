```
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning state array access with coalesced memory access.
// Consider utilizing shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure that hiprandState initialization does not create bottlenecks by overlapping computation with memory operations.
