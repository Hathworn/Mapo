```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for raysPerPrism and prefixSum arrays to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure __restrict__ keyword usage for pointers to potentially leverage compiler optimization.
// Explore shared memory for commonly accessed data (if applicable) to reduce global memory traffic.
// Investigate warp-level synchronization techniques to optimize atomic operations (if any) for indicesOfPrisms and numberOfReflections.
// Analyze occupancy metrics to ensure optimal usage of available GPU resources, potentially tuning block size or grid configuration.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling techniques can be applied for the parallel loop to reduce overhead.
