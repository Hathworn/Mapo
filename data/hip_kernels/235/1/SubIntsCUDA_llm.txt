// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Consider vectorized memory operations for improved throughput.
// Evaluate warp divergence and optimize branch instructions.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory access overhead.
// Employ memory coalescing to maximize bandwidth utilization.
