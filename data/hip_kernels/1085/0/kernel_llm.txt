```
// Consider reducing shared memory usage for better performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads and writes
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Adjust block and thread dimensions for optimal occupancy and execution efficiency
// Include conditional checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access in edge cases
// Use __syncthreads() effectively to avoid unnecessary synchronization points
