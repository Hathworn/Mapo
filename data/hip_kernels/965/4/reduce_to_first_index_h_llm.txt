// Consider coalesced memory access for global reads and writes to X.
// Use occupancy analysis to determine optimal block size for better performance.
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() by restructuring computation.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling in the height loop can improve performance.
// Ensure shared memory usage is within the limits to avoid bank conflicts.
