```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to stage bias values and reduce global memory traffic if multiple accesses occur
// Evaluate launching more threads per block if register and shared memory usage allow, to maximize GPU resource utilization
// Align data structures in memory for optimal access patterns, such as padding if necessary
// Profile the kernel with various block sizes and grid dimensions to find the optimal configuration
