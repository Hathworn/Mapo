// Consider using shared memory to cache sinf and cosf values within each block.
// Compute theta only once and reuse the value in both xx and yy calculations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning CIRCLE_SEGMENTS with the warp size.
// Try to minimize divergent branches by restructuring the code or loop order.
