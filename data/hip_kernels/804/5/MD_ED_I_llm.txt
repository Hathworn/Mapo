```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Coalesce global memory access for T to improve memory bandwidth
// Ensure T2 data fetching is done in a coalesced pattern
// Use atomic operations to resolve data dependencies in reduction
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing allocation
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce synchronization latency
