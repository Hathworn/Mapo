```
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve data coalescing.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access.
// Minimize thread divergence within warp execution.
// Consider loop unrolling for j-loop to improve performance.
// Load T array cooperatively using all threads to reduce redundant loads.
// Ensure all threads participating in __syncthreads() have reached that point.
