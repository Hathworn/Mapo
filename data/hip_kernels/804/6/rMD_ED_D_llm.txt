```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing the reads from global memory.
// Use shared memory to store the necessary portions of the data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Ensure enough threads are launched to hide latency through occupancy.
// Consider using float4 for loading multiple floats at once from global memory.
// Preload data into shared memory to minimize data movement within inner loops.
// Align shared memory usage for optimal bank access to prevent bank conflicts.
// Consider loop unrolling if there's potential for increased performance.
