```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads from global memory
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data from global memory
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed size loops to reduce loop overhead
