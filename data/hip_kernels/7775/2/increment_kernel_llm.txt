// Consider coalescing memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure the grid configuration uses an appropriate number of blocks and threads for efficient execution.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Investigate loop unrolling or other techniques to increase throughput if g_data is large.
