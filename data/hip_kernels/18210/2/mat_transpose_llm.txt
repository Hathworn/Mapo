// Use shared memory to improve data locality
// Apply boundary checks to prevent accessing out-of-bound memory
// Use tile width padding to avoid shared memory bank conflicts
// Load data into shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Perform synchronized threads to ensure all data is transposed correctly within each block
