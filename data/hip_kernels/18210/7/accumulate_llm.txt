```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access, improving bandwidth utilization.
// Load data into shared memory once and perform computations locally to minimize global reads.
// Handle boundary conditions with zero padding to avoid memory out-of-bounds errors.
// Implement reduction using shared memory to decrease latency and enhance performance.
// Synchronize threads with __syncthreads to ensure data consistency during reduction.
// Only write the final result from block 0 to global memory, optimizing memory writes.
