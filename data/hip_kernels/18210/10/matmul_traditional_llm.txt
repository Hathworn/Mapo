// Consider using shared memory to cache blocks of the input matrices 'a' and 'b' to reduce global memory access.  
// Optimize block size and dimensions to increase the number of active warps, maximizing resource utilization.  
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns, particularly for global loads and stores.  
// Experiment with loop unrolling the innermost loop to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.  
// Check for bank conflicts when using shared memory and adjust indexing where necessary to avoid them.
