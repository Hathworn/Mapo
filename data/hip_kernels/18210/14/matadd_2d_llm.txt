```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations in 2D
// Use shared memory to load data in tiles and reduce global memory accesses
// Experiment with thread block size to match the GPU architecture and maximize occupancy
// Ensure proper memory alignment to improve memory access speed and efficiency
