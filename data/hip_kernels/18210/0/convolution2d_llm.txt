```
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage if kernel size is known to be less than 32x32.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are set to maximize occupancy and efficient GPU utilization.
// Minimize divergent code paths in the kernel for better performance.
// Evaluate if padding calculations can be further optimized or pre-computed.
// Make sure to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory when accessing shared_kernel.
