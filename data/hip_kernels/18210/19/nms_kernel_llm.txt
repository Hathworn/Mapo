```
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in memory copy section.
// Optimize bank conflicts in shared memory access for performance gain.
// Exploit memory coalescing by aligning data access with warp threads.
// Minimize control divergence by carefully structuring conditional operations.
// Use pragma unroll for the loop to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Reduce warp divergence by iterating only the necessary number of times.
