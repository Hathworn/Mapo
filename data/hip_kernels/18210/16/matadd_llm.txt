```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve data locality.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to take advantage of coalesced memory access on GPUs.
// Use warp-level primitives if possible to further optimize memory access patterns.
// Ensure loop unrolling for better performance by reducing loop overhead.
