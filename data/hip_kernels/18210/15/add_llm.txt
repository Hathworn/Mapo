// Use memory coalescing by ensuring threads in warp access contiguous memory addresses.
// Consider using shared memory to store elements of a[] and b[] for faster access within a block.
// Assess the use of texture memory for read-only data to improve cache performance.
// Optimize stride calculation for better warp efficiency and minimal divergence.
