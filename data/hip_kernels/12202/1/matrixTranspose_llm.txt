// Use shared memory for tile-based optimization to improve memory access patterns.
// Organize shared memory to avoid bank conflicts with an extra +1 in array dimensions.
// Load data into shared memory to decrease global memory access latency.
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads() before transposing in shared memory.
// Transpose the block within shared memory which reduces redundant global memory access.
