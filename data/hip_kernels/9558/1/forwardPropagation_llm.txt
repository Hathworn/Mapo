```cpp
// Optimize data loading by coalescing global memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for better throughput
// Reduce __syncthreads() by reorganizing loop iterations
// Minimize divergent branches inside the loop
// Evaluate potential for loop unrolling if beneficial
```
