```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Reduce memory access latency by pre-fetching normalization_factor[pos] if possible
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block to decrease global memory accesses
// Optimize conditional checks inside the kernel for branch divergence reduction
// Explore memory alignment techniques for optimal memory transaction efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling for potential performance improvements if within a loop context
