```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider memory alignment to enhance access speed
// Prefetch data to shared memory to hide memory latency
// Employ vectorized operations if applicable to reduce instructions
// Minimize divergent branches in warp execution
// Balance workload by adjusting block and grid sizes
