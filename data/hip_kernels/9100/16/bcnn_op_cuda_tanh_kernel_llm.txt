// Consider using shared memory for data reused across threads to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergent paths by ensuring uniform execution across threads
// Ensure optimal block and grid size configuration for better utilization of the GPU
// Reuse computed values in registers to reduce repeated calculations
// Investigate occupancy to ensure maximum efficiency of resource usage
