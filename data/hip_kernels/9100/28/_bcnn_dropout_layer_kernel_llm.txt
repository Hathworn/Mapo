```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced access
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory access time
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
