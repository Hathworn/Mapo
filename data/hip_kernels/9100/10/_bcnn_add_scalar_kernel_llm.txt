```
// Use memory coalescing when accessing arrays y for better performance
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is optimized for the GPU architecture
// Consider using shared memory if accessing y in a non-coalesced pattern
// Check if increasing grid size can improve performance without exceeding resource limits
