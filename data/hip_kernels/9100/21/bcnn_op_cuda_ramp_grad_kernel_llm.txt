```
// Consider using memory coalescing to optimize global memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads.
// Minimize thread divergence by rearranging conditional statements.
// Use intrinsic functions for potential computational optimizations.
// Ensure that the grid and block sizes are optimized for the target device.
