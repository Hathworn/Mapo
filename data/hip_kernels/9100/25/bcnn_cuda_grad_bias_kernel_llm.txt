// Consider coalesced memory access for grad_data to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize thread block size and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Explore using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data from grad_data
// Minimize global memory access by reusing values computed within a block
