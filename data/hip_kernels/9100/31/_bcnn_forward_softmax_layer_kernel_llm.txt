// Consider using shared memory to store the largest value per block for faster access.
// Use `blockDim.x * blockDim.y` to calculate thread index if using 2D blocks for better parallelization.
// Prefetch data into registers before using them in calculations to reduce memory latency.
// Implement loop unrolling in the for loop where possible to optimize computation.
// Use atomic operations if threads need to update shared state to avoid race conditions.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to efficiently compute sums across threads.
