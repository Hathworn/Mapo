```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for global memory reads
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use atomic operations cautiously to avoid performance bottlenecks
// Consider loop unrolling if the block size is fixed and known
