// Ensure coalesced global memory access for better performance.
// Use shared memory to cache repetitive data such as mean and var if beneficial.
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for float4 or float2 when accessing global memory.
// Align data structures in memory to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and improve pipelining efficiency.
