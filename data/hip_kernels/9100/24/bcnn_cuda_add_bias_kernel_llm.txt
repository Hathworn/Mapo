```
// Coalesced access: Ensure that each thread accesses consecutive memory locations
// Ensure that each thread block's x dimension is a multiple of the warp size
// Unroll loops if applicable to reduce loop overhead and improve pipeline efficiency
// Consider using shared memory to leverage faster memory accesses within a block
