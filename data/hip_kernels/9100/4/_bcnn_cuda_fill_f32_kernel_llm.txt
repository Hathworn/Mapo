// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize grid and block size for maximum occupancy.
// Ensure that INCX is 1 to allow for coalesced access patterns.
// Align data structures to minimize misaligned memory accesses.
