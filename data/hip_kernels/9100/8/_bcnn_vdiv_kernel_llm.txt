// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved global memory efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory if there's an opportunity to reuse data within the block.
// Optimize block size to maximize warp utilization and minimize memory access latency.
// Adjust grid size based on hardware capabilities to balance load and reduce overhead.
