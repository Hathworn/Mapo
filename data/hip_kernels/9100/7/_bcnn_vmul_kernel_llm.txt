```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if memory alignment permits
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory properly
// Minimize unnecessary synchronization within the loop
// Consider loop unrolling for further performance improvement
