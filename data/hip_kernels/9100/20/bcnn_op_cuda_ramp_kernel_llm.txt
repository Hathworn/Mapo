```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous elements
// Use shared memory if accessing x[i] multiple times to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling if 'n' is guaranteed to be large for further performance gain
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring conditions favorably
// Adjust block size to match the GPU architecture for optimal performance
