// Consider reducing the number of atomic operations in accumulation.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure shared memory is used efficiently to reduce bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling improves performance for b or wxh loops.
// Assess if using grid-stride loops can improve loading and compute balance.
