```c
// Consider aligning data access to improve memory coalescing.
// Implement shared memory to cache repetitive data and reduce global memory reads.
// Investigate warp divergence in the condition check for further optimization.
// Use half precision if the precision requirement allows it for better performance.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find the optimal configuration.
