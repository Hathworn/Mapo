// Consider using warp shuffle for data exchange within thread block
// Minimize conditional statements within the kernel
// Explore optimal block and grid sizes based on hardware architecture
// Ensure shared memory usage is within device limits
// Use coalesced memory access for global memory loads and stores
// Evaluate if padding shared memory arrays can avoid bank conflicts
