```c
// Ensure shared memory size is appropriately defined based on block dimensions to optimize data reuse
// Minimize global memory accesses by utilizing shared memory effectively
// Load matrix data into shared memory in stripes to optimize coalesced memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure correct synchronization between threads accessing shared memory
// Unroll loops when possible for better performance
// Consider edge cases and ensure bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Optimize thread block size for the target GPU architecture to maximize occupancy
