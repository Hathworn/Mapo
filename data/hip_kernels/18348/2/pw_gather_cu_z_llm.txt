```c
// Consider using shared memory for data that is reused across threads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to optimize global memory throughput.
// Align data structures to 128 bytes to improve memory access patterns.
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing the data accordingly.
// Assess and optimize the grid and block dimensions for better performance.
