// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for elements that are repeatedly used.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly.
// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance and reduced control overhead.
// Optimize the use of registers by limiting unnecessary variable declarations within loops.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from caching.
