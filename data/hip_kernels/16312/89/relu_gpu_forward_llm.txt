```
// Use grid-stride loop for coalesced memory access
// Minimize branching by using mathematical functions
// Prefetch data to shared memory if reuse is high
// Consider loop unrolling if performance gains are observed
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure sufficient parallelization
// Use proper data alignment for potential memory coalescing
