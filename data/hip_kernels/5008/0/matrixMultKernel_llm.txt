// Consider using matrix elements padding in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate the impact of using different shared memory tile sizes for performance.
// Ensure optimal block size and grid size are chosen based on the problem dimensions.
// Check memory access patterns for coalescing to maximize global memory throughput.
// Verify that shared memory tile size matches block dimension for optimal synchronization.
