```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if multiple threads access the same data.
// Optimize block size to ensure efficient use of the GPU's resources.
// Minimize divergent execution by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
