// Consider using shared memory to store sub-matrices of a and b for improved cache utilization
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns for better performance
// Experiment with different block and grid dimensions to maximize GPU occupancy and efficiency
// Allocate sufficient registers by adjusting compiler flags to allow more in-flight threads
