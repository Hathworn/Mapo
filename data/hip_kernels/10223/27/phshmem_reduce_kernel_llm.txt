```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory access for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory traffic
// Perform loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and synchronization
// Utilize the last warp efficiently with volatile access to skip __syncthreads()
// Ensure only thread 0 performs the write operation to global memory to avoid race conditions
