```
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() after loading to ensure all threads have the data they need
// Perform reduction in shared memory to minimize global memory traffic
// Use a power of two for blockDim.x for efficient shared memory usage
// Use thread synchronization between steps to ensure data consistency
// Perform minimal atomic operations by having only thread 0 write the result
