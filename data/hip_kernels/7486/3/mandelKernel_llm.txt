```
// Use shared memory to keep data accessed by multiple threads, reducing global memory accesses
// Utilize __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve compiler optimization
// Employ loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Replace division operations with multiplications wherever possible for better performance
// Consider using double2 type to handle pairs of double variables more efficiently
// Reduce precision if double is not necessary, such as using float instead of double
// Attempt to utilize warp shuffle operations for inter-thread communication in the same warp
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations
