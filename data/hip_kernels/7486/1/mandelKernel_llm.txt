```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate loop unrolling for the iterative loop to enhance performance.
// Ensure that memory writes are coalesced to minimize global memory traffic.
// Consider using texture memory if access patterns exhibit spatial locality.
// Reduce divergence by minimizing conditional branches within loops.
