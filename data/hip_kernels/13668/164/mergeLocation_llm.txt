```
// Use coalesced memory access to optimize global memory transactions.
// Ensure the data types are aligned to prevent misaligned memory accesses.
// Minimize the use of global memory to improve performance by using registers.
// Consider using shared memory for common data across threads in a block if applicable.
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance.
// Ensure the kernel launch configuration is tuned for your specific hardware.
