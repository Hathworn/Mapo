```
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize redundant boundary checks.
// Avoid unnecessary boundary checks for pixels by pre-calculating their validity.
// Use __forceinline__ keyword for functions to suggest inlining, reducing call overhead.
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescence and reduce bank conflicts.
// Consider unrolling loops when possible for increased performance.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls to minimize warp synchronization overhead.
