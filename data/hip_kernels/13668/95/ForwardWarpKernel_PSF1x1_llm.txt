```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for `u` and `v` when fetching flow vectors
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for `u`, `v`, and `src`
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data access optimization (e.g., `src` array)
// Prefetch data into registers when computing `cx` and `cy` to reduce memory latency
// Optimize boundary checks and calculations to reduce branch divergence among threads
