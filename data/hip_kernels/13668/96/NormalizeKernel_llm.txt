```
// Use shared memory to cache normalization_factor for better memory access patterns
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for image data to benefit from coalesced accesses
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy while considering shared memory usage
// Use loop unrolling if computation within the kernel allows it for better throughput
// Review data alignment for potential benefits in memory access efficiency
