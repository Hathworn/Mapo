// Ensure memory coalescing for optimal memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within a block is possible
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Minimize global memory accesses by reducing redundant reads and writes
// If applicable, use vectorized loads and stores for better bandwidth usage
