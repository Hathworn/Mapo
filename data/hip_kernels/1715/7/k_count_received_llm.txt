```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring that all threads in a warp execute the same code path.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to d_n_recv_by_block to enhance memory access efficiency.
// Align data structures to 32 bytes where possible to maximize memory access efficiency.
