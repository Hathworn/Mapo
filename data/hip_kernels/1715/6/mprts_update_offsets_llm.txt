```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to cache d_spine_sums values for blocks
// Check if reducing the number of global memory accesses can improve performance
// Ensure memory alignment for d_spine_sums and d_off
// Minimize memory divergence within warp when accessing d_spine_sums
