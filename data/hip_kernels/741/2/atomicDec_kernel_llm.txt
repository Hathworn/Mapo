// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data, like d_quantity, to reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for d_probabilities, d_quantity, and d_count arrays.
// Minimize divergence within warp using conditional statements that can be optimized.
// Use profiling tools to identify cache hit and miss patterns and optimize data layout accordingly.
// If possible, use atomic operations with reduced contention to improve performance.
