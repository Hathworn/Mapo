```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing x and dx arrays sequentially.
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using float2 or float4 for memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Apply loop unrolling where it benefits the most in computation-heavy sections.
