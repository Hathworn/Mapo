```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as 'dc[i]' and 's[i]' to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling to optimize computation, especially for operations inside 'if' conditions.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by restructuring loops and data layout to minimize global memory transaction overhead.
// Use vectorized memory access patterns with float4 or similar types to improve throughput.
// Evaluate the thread and block configuration for optimal utilization of GPU resources and reduced latency.
