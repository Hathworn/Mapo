```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for 'delta' and 'x' arrays
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like 'x'
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning data structure
// Minimize the number of arithmetic operations in kernel by precomputing repetitive terms
// Adjust block size and grid size for maximum occupancy
