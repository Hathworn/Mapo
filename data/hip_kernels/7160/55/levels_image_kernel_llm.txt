```
// Minimize shared memory use to prevent bank conflicts
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Optimize the usage of registers within device functions to reduce register spilling
// Use texture memory for repeated access to certain data like random numbers if beneficial
// Avoid divergence in the kernel by minimizing conditional statements
// Consider loop unrolling for operations inside the kernel if applicable
