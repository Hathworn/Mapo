```
// Avoid divergent branching by minimizing warp divergence
// Prefetch rand[id] and input[id] to reduce memory latency
// Use shared memory if possible for rand[id] to speed up access
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to utilize GPU cores more efficiently
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
