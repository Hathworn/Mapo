```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for output array
// Use shared memory if biases are accessed frequently
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on GPU architecture
// Consider using float4 for memory transactions to increase bandwidth
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads follow similar execution paths
```
