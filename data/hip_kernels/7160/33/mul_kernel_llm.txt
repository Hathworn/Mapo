// Use shared memory to store data for threads in the same block to reduce global memory access.  
// Consider memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure memory alignment to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead and improve performance.
