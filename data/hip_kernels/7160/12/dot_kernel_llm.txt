```cpp
// Use padding in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider using float3 or float4 for coalesced memory access
// Merge loops to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use faster intrinsic functions for math operations like rsqrtf
// Accumulate partial sums in registers before shared memory reduction
```
