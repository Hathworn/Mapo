```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved bandwidth utilization
// Avoid divergent branches within the loop to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Ensure that pred, truth, delta, and error are aligned in memory for optimal access
// Use shared memory if possible to cache reused data and reduce global memory access
```
