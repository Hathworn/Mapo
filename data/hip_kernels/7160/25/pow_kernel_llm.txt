// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data.
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using vectorized operations for better utilization of memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
