```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data like 'truth_val' if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Consider adjusting the grid and block dimensions to better utilize the GPU's resources and improve occupancy.
// Unroll loops if there are any to enable more efficient execution by minimizing loop overhead.
// Evaluate if using __restrict__ keyword could help in reducing pointer aliasing issues for 'pred', 'truth', 'delta', and 'error' pointers.
// Experiment with using texture memory if the 'truth' data does not change frequently to accelerate memory reads.
