```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Apply loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve instruction throughput.
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous memory copy to overlap data transfer with computation.
// Assess the grid and block dimensions to achieve maximum occupancy and minimize idle resources.
