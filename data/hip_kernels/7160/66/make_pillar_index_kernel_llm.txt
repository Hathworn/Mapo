```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate potential index calculations for shared memory usage to reduce global memory latency.
// Minimize atomic operations where possible to avoid contention and improve performance.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized for better parallel efficiency.
