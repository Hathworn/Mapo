```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory if there is data reuse within a block
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring INCX is 1 where possible
// Minimize bank conflicts by accessing memory in stride-1 pattern
// Ensure threads within a warp handle contiguous elements for efficiency
