```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring INCX is 1 for better performance.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access.
// Increase block size if there are no shared memory constraints to improve occupancy.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are configured to fully utilize the GPU.
