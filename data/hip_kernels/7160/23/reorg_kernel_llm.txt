```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase data locality.
// Consider using vectorized data types to increase memory throughput.
// Use warp shuffle functions to optimize reduction and memory access patterns.
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency.
