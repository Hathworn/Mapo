```
// Consider loop unrolling for the 'l' and 'm' loops to improve performance.
// Use shared memory to load 'delta' elements accessed repeatedly by threads.
// Check if 'prev_delta' can be moved to shared memory to reduce global memory updates.
// Align memory accesses for 'delta' and 'indexes' to optimize cache usage.
// Use texture memory for reading 'delta' if spatial locality is high.
