```
// Reduce global memory accesses by accumulating sum in a local variable
// Perform computation to calculate mean outside of nested loops to avoid redundant operations
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for `x` to improve memory throughput
// Check for opportunities to use shared memory to further reduce global memory traffic
