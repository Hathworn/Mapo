```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for pred, truth, delta, and error arrays
// Ensure arrays are aligned to cache line boundaries for better caching
// Consider use of shared memory for frequently accessed data within thread blocks
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads in a warp take the same execution path
// Identify and eliminate redundant calculations within the kernel where possible
```
