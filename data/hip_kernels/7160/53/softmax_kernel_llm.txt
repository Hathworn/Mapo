// Ensure memory coalescing for input and output access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same path in conditionals
// Preload data in shared memory to optimize repeated access in loops
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization; use __syncthreads only when data dependencies exist
// Align shared memory size with warp size for better memory access efficiency
// Prefer built-in math functions like expf for better performance
// Fine-tune block and grid dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources
