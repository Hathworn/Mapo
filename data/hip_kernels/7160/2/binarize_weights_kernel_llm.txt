```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement loop unrolling more extensively for both mean calculation and binary assignment.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further optimize reduction and binary assignment.
// Reduce the precision of float operations if possible to improve performance.
