```
// Use shared memory for 'input' to reduce global memory access latency.
// Prefetch 'input' data to registers to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for 'for' loops within 'softmax_device' to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern in 'softmax_tree_kernel' for improved memory throughput.
// Use warp shuffle operations to perform parallel reductions within a warp for the 'largest' and 'sum' calculations.
// Balance the workload among threads to avoid thread divergence and underutilization.
// Use cooperative groups to improve synchronization efficiency within the same block, if applicable.
