```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory transactions.
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Ensure alignment of memory addresses to optimize global memory access.
// Investigate use of asynchronous memory copies if data transfer can overlap with computation.
