// Optimize memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Consider splitting the kernel into two separate kernels for X and Y processing
// Evaluate using shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Minimize the use of atomic operations if possible, to improve performance
// Ensure variables are aligned to improve memory access efficiency
