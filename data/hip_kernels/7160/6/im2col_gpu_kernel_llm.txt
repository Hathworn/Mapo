```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed ksize values
// Optimize global memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Reduce divergence by minimizing warps with different execution paths
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
