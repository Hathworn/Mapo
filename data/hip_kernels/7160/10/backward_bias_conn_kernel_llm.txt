```
// Consider using shared memory to store partial sums to reduce global memory accesses.
// Reduce the loop iterations by processing multiple elements per thread if possible.
// Use atomic operations if updating global memory from multiple threads to ensure correctness.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and accessing memory in contiguous patterns.
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to further optimize reduction operations.
