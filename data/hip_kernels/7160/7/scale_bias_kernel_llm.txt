```
// Ensure offset index is calculated accurately to prevent memory access errors
// Compute the index outside of loops to enhance computational efficiency
// Coalesce memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Optimize block size and threads per block to maximize occupancy and performance
// Consider using float4 data type for vectorized operations to increase throughput
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to optimize memory accesses
