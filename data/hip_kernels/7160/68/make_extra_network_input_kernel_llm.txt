```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure __restrict__ qualifiers are used for input pointers to enable better compiler optimization.
// Use shared memory to cache repeated accesses of dev_x_coors_for_sub and dev_y_coors_for_sub to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize control flow by minimizing warp divergence in the if statement.
