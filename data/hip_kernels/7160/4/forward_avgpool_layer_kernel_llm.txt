// Ensure shared memory utilization is maximized for accumulation
// Optimize memory coalescing by rearranging input indices access pattern
// Use atomic operations to further optimize reduction if needed
// Consider using warp shuffle for further reduction efficiency
// Ensure grid and block dimensions optimize full occupancy of GPU
// Test different block sizes for optimal shared memory usage and occupancy
