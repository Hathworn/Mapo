```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store partial results for each block.
// Reduce bank conflicts by avoiding simultaneous access to the same bank by multiple threads.
// Optimize the thread block size to match the GPU architecture for better occupancy.
// Unroll the inner loops to minimize loop overhead and increase ILP (Instruction-Level Parallelism).
// Use fast math operations where precision can be traded off for performance.
