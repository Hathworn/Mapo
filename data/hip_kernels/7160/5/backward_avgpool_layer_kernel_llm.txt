```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Analyze memory coalescing opportunities to improve throughput
// Evaluate if pointer arithmetic can be simplified for better readability
// Verify if memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture
// Assess potential benefits of using atomic operations if necessary
