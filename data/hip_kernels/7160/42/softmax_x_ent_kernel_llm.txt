```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve performance.
// Ensure pred, truth, delta, and error arrays are allocated and aligned properly.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if possible.
// Verify if loop unrolling can enhance performance in this kernel.
// Analyze occupancy and block size for optimal thread scheduling.
// Profile and minimize register usage for enhanced performance.
