```c
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed values like mean and variance for faster access.
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable to enhance performance and SIMD utilization.
// Align data structures in memory to avoid misaligned accesses which can degrade performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory to ensure efficient memory access patterns.
// Prefetch next needed elements into registers to hide memory latency and improve data throughput.
// Utilize vectorized memory operations to increase bandwidth utilization and reduce instruction count.
