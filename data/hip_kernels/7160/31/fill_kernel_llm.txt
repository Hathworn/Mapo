```
// Use shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize redundant memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transaction overhead
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming to optimize performance on parallel writes
