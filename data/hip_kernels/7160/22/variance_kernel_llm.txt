```
// Consider using shared memory to store parts of x and mean for reducing global memory accesses.
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring global memory access patterns are aligned and contiguous.
// Ensure branch divergence is minimized in the for-loop iterations.
// Increase thread occupancy by optimizing block size and threads per block.
// Apply loop unrolling more extensively to further enhance throughput.
// Replace repeated calculations with pre-computed constant values where possible.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to indicate non-aliasing and improve compiler optimization.
