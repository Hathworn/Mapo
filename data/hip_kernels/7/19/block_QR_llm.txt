```
// Utilize shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Use appropriate stride to minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Avoid using unnecessary __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Ensure aligned memory accesses to benefit from coalesced memory transactions.
