```
// Precompute indices to minimize redundant calculations
// Use shared memory for frequent data to reduce global memory access latency
// Maximize coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory throughput
// Ensure optimal thread block size to balance memory access and parallel execution
// Avoid branch divergence by organizing data access patterns accordingly
```
