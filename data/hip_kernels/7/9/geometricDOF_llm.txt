```c
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider memory coalescing by aligning data structures for better access patterns.
// Minimize branching and divergence within the loop to improve parallel execution efficiency.
// Fuse adjacent memory operations to minimize memory transaction count.
