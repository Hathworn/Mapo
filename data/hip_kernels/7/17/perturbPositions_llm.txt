```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring blocks array is accessed by consecutive threads
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data such as blocks array
// Optimize memory access patterns by minimizing divergent paths in the code
// Attempt to use vectorized loads/stores for initpos and blockpos
```
