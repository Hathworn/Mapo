```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like `mass` and `forces1`/`forces2` contributing to `massProduct` and `blockScale`
// Minimize the number of repeated arithmetic operations by pre-computing values used multiple times
// Ensure that threads within a warp are accessing sequential memory addresses to maximize efficiency
// Align data structures to natural boundaries to reduce misaligned memory access penalties
