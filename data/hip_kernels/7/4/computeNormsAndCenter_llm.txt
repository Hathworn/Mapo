```
// Consider using shared memory for cent and totalmass to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous access patterns for positions and masses arrays
// Explore using __ldg() intrinsic for reading constant data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Assess the impact of using atomic operations for totalmass updates if needed in a multi-block context
// Investigate potential benefits of adjusting block and thread sizes for better GPU utilization
