```
// Consider memory coalescing for improved memory access efficiency
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic and latency
// Ensure alignment of data for better memory transaction performance
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring stride access patterns
// Look into the use of asynchronous memory prefetching
// Review register usage to avoid register spilling to local memory
