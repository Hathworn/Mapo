```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Ensure that 'target' and 'source' are aligned to 128 or 256 bytes if possible
// Use shared memory to cache 'source' data if multiple threads require the same data
// Check if combining multiple small memory transactions is feasible to reduce global memory operations
// Optimize memory access patterns to be stride-one where possible
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce the overhead of loop control and increase pipeline utilization
