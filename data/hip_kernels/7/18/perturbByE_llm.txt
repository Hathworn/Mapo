// Consider using __ldg() for read-only global memory access to E and masses arrays.
// Optimize by leveraging shared memory to minimize global memory writes for tmppos.
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory transaction efficiency.
// Ensure that mypos updates are minimized and potentially aggregate writes to reduce global memory pressure.
