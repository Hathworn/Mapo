```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous thread accesses
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution
// Balance the workload across blocks to maximize resource utilization
// Ensure enough work per block to cover memory latency
```
