// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by properly aligning memory accesses.
// Use __syncthreads() to coordinate shared memory usage between threads.
// Apply loop unrolling to optimize the loop computation.
// Check boundary conditions to avoid out-of-bound memory accesses.
