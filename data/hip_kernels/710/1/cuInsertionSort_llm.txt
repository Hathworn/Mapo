```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for p_dist and p_ind to improve memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to further reduce global memory accesses within each block.
// Minimize divergent branches to increase warp efficiency, especially in sorting logic.
// Check if employing a block-wise sort strategy using shared memory could lead to better performance.
// Ensure memory alignment to maximize throughput and reduce potential memory access penalties.
