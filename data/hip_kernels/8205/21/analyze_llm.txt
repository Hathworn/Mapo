// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring aligned access patterns for input and sum arrays.
// Assess use of shared memory for reduction instead of atomicAdd for potential performance improvement.
// Investigate using warp shuffle operations for intra-warp reduction to minimize latency.
// Evaluate grid and block dimensions to ensure optimal occupancy and minimize memory divergence.
