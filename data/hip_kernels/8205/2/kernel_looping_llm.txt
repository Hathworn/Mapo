// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory bandwidth usage
// Evaluate potential benefits of using warp-level primitives for synchronization
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory accesses and resolve if identified
