```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to aid compiler optimizations.
// Ensure that 'n' is a multiple of 'stride' for avoiding divergent code paths.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory latency if data reuse is possible.
