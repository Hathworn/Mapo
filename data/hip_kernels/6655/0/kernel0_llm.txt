```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize divergence by ensuring warp-wide execution paths
// Use loop unrolling to maximize ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Assess if memory access patterns benefit from texture memory
