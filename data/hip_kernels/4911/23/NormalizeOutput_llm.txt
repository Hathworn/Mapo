```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory addresses.
// Use shared memory if applicable to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure proper occupancy balancing by adjusting block and grid size configurations.
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for memory-bound instructions to enhance throughput.
