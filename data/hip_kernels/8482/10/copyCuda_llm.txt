```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data so consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Use shared memory to store chunks of data that multiple threads within the same block will access.
// Experiment with different block sizes to determine the optimal configuration for memory throughput.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that most threads in the same warp follow the same execution path.
