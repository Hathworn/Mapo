// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize global memory transactions by using memory coalescing techniques.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses when processing blocks of data.
// Ensure that the data loaded into shared memory is accessed by multiple threads to maximize shared memory utilization.
