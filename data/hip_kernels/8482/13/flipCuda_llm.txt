```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for in and out arrays.
// Memory access could be optimized by aligning row sizes to memory boundaries.
// Use loop unrolling if the pixel processing can benefit from it.
// Prefetch data from global memory to shared memory if reusable within the kernel.
