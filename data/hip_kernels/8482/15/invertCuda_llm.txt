// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads and writes
// Consider loop unrolling for improved throughput
// Minimize branching within the kernel for better performance
// Ensure enough threads to maximize occupancy and hide latency
