```
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring row size aligns with warp size.
// Use shared memory to cache input data when possible.
// Minimize branching by organizing code to reduce conditional statements.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for occupancy.
// Prefer to use __restrict__ keyword for all pointer parameters.
// Consider using half or float for better throughput if applicable.
// Align data structures to avoid misaligned memory access.
// Use loop unrolling if the width/height can be assumed as powers of two.
