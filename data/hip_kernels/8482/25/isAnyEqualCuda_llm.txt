```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for 'value'
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses when fetching 'image' and 'value'
// Ensure shared memory utilization is optimal for 'valueCount'
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used after loading shared memory
// Optimize atomic operations by minimizing their frequency
```
