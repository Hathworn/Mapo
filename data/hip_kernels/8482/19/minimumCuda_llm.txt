// Consider coalescing memory accesses by using shared memory if appropriate
// Ensure inputs and outputs are aligned to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Use texture memory for read-only data to improve cache performance if beneficial
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and reduce divergence
