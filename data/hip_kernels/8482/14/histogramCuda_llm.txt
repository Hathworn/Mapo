```c
// Optimize global memory access by using shared memory for histogram bins.
// Ensure block size is 256 to match shared memory initialization.
// Consider reducing the number of __syncthreads() for performance.
// Use atomic operations in shared memory to prevent bank conflicts and improve speed.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the given problem size.
