// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns for input and output arrays
// Minimize conditional branching for pixel boundary checks
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Evaluate the usage of constant memory for small constants like 'cosAngle' and 'sinAngle'
