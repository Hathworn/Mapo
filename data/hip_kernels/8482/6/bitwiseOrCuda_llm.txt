```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring rowSizeIn1, rowSizeIn2, and rowSizeOut are multiples of the warp size.
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning data accesses with cache line size.
// Use shared memory if access patterns can be optimized for reuse within a block.
// Check for memory alignment to reduce uncoalesced global memory transactions.
