```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning rowSize with memory boundaries
// Ensure that data types are consistent to prevent misaligned memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if patterns are detected
// Experiment with loop unrolling if there are repeated operations in a loop
// Optimize thread block size to match the warp size of the GPU for efficiency
