```
// Consider utilizing shared memory to minimize global memory access overhead.
// Pre-load data into shared memory to enhance memory coalescing.
// Leverage shared memory in the loop to reduce redundant global memory reads.
// Using __syncthreads() ensures all threads have written their data before reading.
// Handle the special case outside the main loop to avoid conditional checks inside the loop.
// Keep minimum logic inside critical sections to prevent branch divergence.
