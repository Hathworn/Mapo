```
// Consider coalesced memory access for cur_tot_weight to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Align quadratic and linear arrays in memory to reduce cache conflicts.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for quadratic and linear arrays.
// Increase occupancy by optimizing block and grid size based on the hardware's maximum thread capability.
// Conduct thread-wise work aggregation to reduce the number of threads performing redundant operations.
// Minimize global memory loads by storing prior_scale_change in a register within the loop.
