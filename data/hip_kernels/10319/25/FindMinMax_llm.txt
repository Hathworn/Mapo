```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_Data to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize redundant data loading.
// Ensure that the __shared__ memory usage is aligned for optimal access patterns.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads calls when possible to improve performance.
// Evaluate the block and grid size to ensure maximum utilization of the GPU resources.
// Minimize the use of conditional branches for better execution efficiency.
