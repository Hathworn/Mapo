```
// Ensure data loading to shared memory coalesces memory accesses where possible
// Consider using double buffering technique to hide global memory access latency
// Align shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts
// Use available registers to store intermediate computation results when practical
// Assess warp divergence and ensure threads within a warp take the same execution path
// Minimize shared memory usage by identifying and eliminating redundant data
// Explore occupancy optimizations to fully utilize the GPU's computational resources
// Profile and evaluate the kernel to identify bottlenecks in computation or memory access
