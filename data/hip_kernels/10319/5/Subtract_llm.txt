```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve throughput.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to reduce memory transactions.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to minimize global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the use of memory prefetching to overlap computation with memory access.
// Minimize the use of global memory by storing intermediate results in registers.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for best hardware utilization.
