```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to improve memory coalescing.
// Align shared memory access patterns to ensure coalescing.
// Utilize `__syncthreads()` judiciously to synchronize threads and utilize shared memory effectively.
// Minimize redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in shared memory.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of loop control in repetitive tasks.
// Reuse shared memory variables across loop iterations when possible.
// Balance shared memory usage with register usage to avoid register spilling.
