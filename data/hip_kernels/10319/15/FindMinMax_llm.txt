```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergence by iterating in shared memory
// Unroll loops to increase warp execution efficiency
// Optimize reduction using warp-level primitives for synchronization
// Store final results from shared memory to global memory at blocks' level
```
