// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by enforcing alignment
// Use loop unrolling to optimize the convolution calculation
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by checking access patterns
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources
// Optimize boundary checks to reduce control flow divergence
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce the latency of global memory access
