```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for g_Data to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using float2 (or another vector type) for loading shared memory to improve data movement efficiency.
// Precompute as many constant calculations as possible outside of loops.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Consider reducing histograms with parallel reduction to speed up the process.
// Cache frequently accessed values in registers to reduce shared memory usage.
// Ensure calculations within thread-safe atomic operations remain efficient to minimize bottlenecks.
// Evaluate whether shared memory bank conflicts could be impacting performance and optimize access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling where possible to reduce loop overhead.
