```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access, if applicable
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to improve memory access speed
// Optimize memory bank conflicts within shared memory if shared memory is used later
// Review grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy
// Remove unnecessary synchronization points to reduce overhead
