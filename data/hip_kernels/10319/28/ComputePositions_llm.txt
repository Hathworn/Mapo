```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring data loaded is contiguous in memory
// Use shared memory if multiple threads in the same block access overlapping data
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize memory load latency
// Apply loop unrolling if any loop structure is present to enhance performance
// Minimize global memory writes by using shared memory for intermediate calculations
// Align memory allocations to improve memory read/write efficiency
// Consider the use of texture memory for read-only data to better caching performance
