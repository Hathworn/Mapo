```cpp
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory loads
// Consider using texture memory for constant Gaussian weights
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for histogram reduction loop
// Avoid divergent branches in peak detection
// Use shared memory efficiently by loading only necessary data
// Precompute coefficients to avoid redundant calculations
