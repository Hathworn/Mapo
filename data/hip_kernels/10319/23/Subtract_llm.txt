// Consider using shared memory for repeated access patterns to reduce global memory reads.
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize coalesced memory access and reduce memory overhead.
// Ensure that thread blocks are sized appropriately to achieve optimal warping and maximize occupancy.
// Leverage data locality by ensuring continuous memory access within threads of the same block.
// Remove redundant calculations to minimize unnecessary computations and memory access.
