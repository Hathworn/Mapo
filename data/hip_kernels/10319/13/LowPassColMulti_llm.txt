```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider memory coalescing when accessing global memory
// Load data into shared memory in a coalesced manner
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting access patterns
// Unroll loop for better performance, especially within inner loops
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced within global memory loads
// Minimize shared memory use per thread block for better occupancy
// Use __syncthreads() sparingly to reduce synchronization overhead
