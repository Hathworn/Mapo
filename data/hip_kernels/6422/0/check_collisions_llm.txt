// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Preload shared memory with obstacle data to improve memory access speed
// Apply loop unrolling if possible to expedite computation tasks
// Consider using atomic operations if collision results need to be aggregated across threads
