```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for pos_x and pos_y to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for devx to improve memory throughput.
// Unroll loops if possible to decrease loop overhead and improve performance.
// Optimize boundary checks to minimize unnecessary conditional branches.
