// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory elements
// Minimize memory bandwidth by utilizing shared memory for often-reused data
// Avoid branch divergence by synchronizing thread access patterns
// Ensure kernel is launched with optimal block size for better efficiency
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce the number of loop iterations
