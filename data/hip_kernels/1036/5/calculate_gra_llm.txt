```
// Use shared memory for faster access and reduce global memory interactions
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches for optimal thread performance
// Prefetch data to shared memory for threads in a block to utilize temporal locality
// Avoid excessive use of __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead when unnecessary
