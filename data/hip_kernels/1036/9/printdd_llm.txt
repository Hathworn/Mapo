```
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to improve performance
// Consider aligning data structures to cache line size for optimal memory access
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring uniform control paths within warps
