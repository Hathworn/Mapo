// Ensure global memory access is coalesced by aligning data appropriately
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to potentially improve compiler optimizations
// Evaluate the launch configuration to maximize occupancy and resource utilization
// Balance grid and block sizes to minimize warp divergence and memory throttling
