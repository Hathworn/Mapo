// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by loading data into shared memory using threadIdx.x
// Apply reduction in shared memory to minimize synchronization and memory bandwidth usage
// Use atomic operations for final block results to prevent race conditions in global memory
