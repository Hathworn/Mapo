// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory efficiency
// Evaluate if shared memory can be utilized to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by structuring condition checks efficiently
// Investigate if loop unrolling could provide performance benefits
// Assess the usage of constant memory for frequently used constants
