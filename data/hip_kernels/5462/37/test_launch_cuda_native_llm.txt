```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access.
// Use texture memory for read-only data that is accessed frequently in a 3D access pattern.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Assess memory coalescing to ensure that memory accesses are grouped to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Calculate optimal block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy based on available registers and shared memory usage.
