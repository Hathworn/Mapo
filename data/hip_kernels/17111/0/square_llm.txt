```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring array is accessed in a sequential manner.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure the block size is a multiple of warp size to avoid branch divergence.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and efficiency.
