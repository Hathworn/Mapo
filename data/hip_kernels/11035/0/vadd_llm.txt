```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance
// Ensure that input arrays a and b, and output array c are aligned in memory
// Consider using shared memory if further optimization is needed for larger datasets
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find the optimal configuration for the specific hardware
