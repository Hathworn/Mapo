```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access to the warp size
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory if possible
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance performance
// Balance workload by adjusting block and grid dimensions
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data
