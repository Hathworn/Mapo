```
// Use __restrict__ to hint compiler for no aliasing
// Compute global thread index for efficiency
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize memory throughput
// Minimize the use of printf as it can cause serialization of threads
// Align data structures to cache line size for better caching
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
