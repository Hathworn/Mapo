```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring g_data and uniforms are accessed sequentially
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure uniform usage of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement if applicable
// Optimize block size to ensure full occupancy for better performance
