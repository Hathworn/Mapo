// Avoid redundant memory operations by using __fmaf_rn for fused multiply-add
// Use early return to reduce warp divergence for out-of-bounds threads
// Use atomic operations carefully to prevent race conditions while updating shared data
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for improved performance
