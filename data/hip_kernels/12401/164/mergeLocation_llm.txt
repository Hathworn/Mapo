// Consider using memory coalescing for accessing loc_ array
// Ensure that loc_ is aligned properly to take advantage of coalesced memory access
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to reduce overhead
// Check if using shared memory improves performance given the block size and npoints
// Evaluate whether reduced shared memory usage would benefit larger data sets
// Analyze if further loop unrolling could enhance performance depending on hardware specifics
// Experiment with various block sizes to find optimal balance between occupancy and performance
