// Consider using shared memory to store normalization_factor for better memory access pattern.
// Use float instead of float2 if only real values are needed to reduce memory usage.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for image array to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize branching within the kernel for better performance.
