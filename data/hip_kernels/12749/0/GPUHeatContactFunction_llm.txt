```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for repeated data use.
// Consider memory coalescing to enhance bandwidth utilization.
// Prefetch data to maximize memory throughput.
// Ensure proper alignment to minimize memory access latency.
// Group memory accesses to utilize full memory bus width.
