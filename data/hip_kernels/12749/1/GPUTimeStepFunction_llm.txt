```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergent branching in the if condition.
// Use register variables for frequently accessed data.
// Align memory accesses to the warp size for better performance.
// Consider using streams for overlapping computation and data transfer.
