// Avoid redundant memory accesses by reading in_lod[index] only once
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for num_erased array
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures if possible
// Utilize warp-level programming techniques to optimize memory utilization
