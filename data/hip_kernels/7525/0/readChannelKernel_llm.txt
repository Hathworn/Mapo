```
// Use shared memory to store image data for coalesced memory access and reduced global memory transactions
// Consider using texture memory for improved cache performance and reducing global memory access latency
// Optimize the number of registers used by reorganizing computation, thus improving occupancy
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced by aligning data structures and access patterns
