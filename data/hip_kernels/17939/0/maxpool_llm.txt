```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by structuring data access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access times.
// Use the built-in max function for better performance.
// Ensure the workload is evenly distributed across blocks and threads.
// Align memory accesses to maximize coalesced read efficiency.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to fully utilize the GPU resources.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead during filter operations.
// Consider pre-fetching data into shared memory for temporal locality.
