```
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to better utilize shared memory
// Ensure the atomic operations in global memory access are minimized
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring data is accessed linearly
// Use __syncthreads() correctly to ensure all threads complete shared memory operations before proceeding
// Optimize the computation of b_size and b_offset to ensure load balancing across blocks
