```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for the resulting vector
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently utilized and no bank conflicts
// Minimize synchronization by optimizing how shared_u is loaded
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Explore loop unrolling to improve computational throughput
