// Ensure coalesced memory access for arrays 'a' and 'b' to enhance global memory efficiency
// Use warp-level synchronization to minimize __syncthreads() overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts during reduction process
// Consider loop unrolling in the reduction phase for improved performance
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations if contention is high, potentially exploring alternative reduction strategies
