```
// Consider using shared memory to store submatrices of 'a' and 'b' for faster access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by accessing 'b' with coalesced memory pattern.
// Ensure all loads and stores are coalesced to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding shared memory arrays if necessary.
// Pre-load data into registers to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
