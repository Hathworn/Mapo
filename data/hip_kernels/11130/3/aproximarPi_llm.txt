// Consider using shared memory for x and y to reduce global memory access latency
// Check and coalesce global memory access patterns for x and y
// Optimize: Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access if implemented
// Ensure atomic operations on z are minimized or optimized for parallel execution
// Experiment with using warp-level primitives to increase efficiency
