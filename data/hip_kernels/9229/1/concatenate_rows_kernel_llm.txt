```
// Use shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized memory loads and stores to improve memory throughput
// Optimize the loop to avoid redundant calculations or improve instruction-level parallelism
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance by minimizing loop control overhead
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory latency
