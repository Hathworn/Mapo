```cpp
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results of deconcatenation for improved memory access patterns
// Utilize memory coalescing when accessing global memory to improve bandwidth
// Apply loop unrolling in the deconcatenate process to minimize loop overhead and increase parallel execution
// Avoid the use of dynamic memory allocation in the device code for better performance
