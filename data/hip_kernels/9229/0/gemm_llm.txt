```
// Consider using vectorized memory accesses for loading Asub and Bsub to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Ensure Asub and Bsub are coalesced accesses to improve performance.
// Evaluate if BLOCK_SIZE is optimal to balance shared memory usage and parallel efficiency.
// Consider using double buffering technique to overlap computation and memory transfer.
// Investigate if using half-precision arithmetic might improve performance for specific scenarios.
// Profile the kernel to identify warp-level inefficiencies that can be optimized.
