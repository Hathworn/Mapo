```
// Consider using memory coalescing to optimize global memory access patterns.
// Minimize access to global memory by maximizing the use of shared memory.
// Ensure accesses to Asub and Bsub are coalesced to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider using double buffering to hide memory latency.
// Investigate the potential benefits of padding shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration by tuning BLOCK_SIZE to match the hardware specifics.
// Leverage loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase execution speed.
// Align memory accesses by using misalignment techniques to avoid performance penalties.
// Evaluate memory footprint to ensure sufficient occupancy and efficient resource usage.
