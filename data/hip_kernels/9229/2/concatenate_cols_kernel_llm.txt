// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to 'a' for better memory access efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() after writing to shared memory to ensure all threads have the updated data
// Evaluate the use of bank conflict avoidance strategies in shared memory for better performance
// Check if using float4 vectorized memory access can improve performance by utilizing more bandwidth
