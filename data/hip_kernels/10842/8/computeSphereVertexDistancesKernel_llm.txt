```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch vertex data into shared memory for faster access during computation
// Avoid redundant recomputation by caching frequently accessed data in shared memory
// Ensure synchronization among threads after loading data into shared memory
// Minimize thread divergence by standardizing block processing patterns
// Implement memory coalescing to enhance memory access efficiency
// Exploit register usage for intermediate calculations to reduce memory accesses
