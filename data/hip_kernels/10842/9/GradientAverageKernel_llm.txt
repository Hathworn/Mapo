```
// Optimize memory access by using coalesced memory access patterns for D array reads.
// Use loop unrolling techniques within the main computation loop to improve performance.
// Consider using atomics for concurrent writes to shared data if necessary.
// Evaluate if bank conflicts occur in shared memory and optimize accordingly.
// Consider increasing block size to improve occupancy and potentially increase performance.
// Utilize asynchronous memory copy techniques if possible to hide latency.
