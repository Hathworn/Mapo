```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Use __restrict__ pointers to provide the compiler with additional optimization opportunities
// Minimize divergent branches for improved warp efficiency
// Optimize launch configuration for better occupancy and efficiency
