```
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring N is accessed in contiguous blocks
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier on pointers to prevent aliasing and enable better optimizations
// Occupy shared memory if calculations can be reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure loop unrolling by the compiler for performance gains
