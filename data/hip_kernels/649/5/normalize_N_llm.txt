// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring N and norm are accessed in contiguous blocks by each warp.
// Make better use of shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access within the kernel.
// Evaluate data alignment to ensure optimal memory transaction size reducing the number of memory requests.
