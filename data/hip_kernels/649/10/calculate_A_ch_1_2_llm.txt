// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated data such as rho and dz to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure that the thread block dimensions are optimal for memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of using texture memory for read-only data to further enhance memory access patterns.
// Minimize divergent branches within conditional statements to ensure warp execution efficiency.
