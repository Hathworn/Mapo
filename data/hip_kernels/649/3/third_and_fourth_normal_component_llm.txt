```
// Consider coalesced access pattern for arrays to improve memory efficiency
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing the number of variables
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for better performance on the GPU
// Review occupancy to ensure maximum thread usage per block
