```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring data is accessed in contiguous blocks
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize bank conflicts by organizing data accesses to avoid simultaneous accesses to the same memory bank
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are chosen to fully utilize the GPU's resources
