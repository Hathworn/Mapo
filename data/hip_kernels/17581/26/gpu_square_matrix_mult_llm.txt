// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced access patterns by loading entire row/column
// Synchronize threads after loading to avoid race conditions
// Avoid bank conflicts while accessing shared memory
// Minimize use of temporary variables in the compute loop
// Ensure global memory writes are coalesced
