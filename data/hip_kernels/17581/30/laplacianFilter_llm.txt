// Use shared memory to cache tiles of srcImage for faster access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize throughput.
// Consider using texture memory for better spatial locality.
// Experiment with block and grid sizes to balance parallel execution with memory bandwidth.
// Replace magic number kernel size with a constant variable for flexibility and readability.
