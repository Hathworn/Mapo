```
// Consider using shared memory to cache srcImage data for reducing global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding the shared memory array if necessary
// Ensure that the kernel launch configuration is optimal for the target GPU architecture
// Leverage loop unrolling where possible to improve throughput
