```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed kernel to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure all threads have loaded the kernel in shared memory before proceeding with computations
// Check bounds to prevent out-of-bounds access which could lead to undefined behavior
// Minimize use of branching or conditionals inside the main computation loop for efficiency
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize the convolution loops
// Ensure thread and block dimensions are configured to optimize coalesced memory access
