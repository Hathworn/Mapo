```
// Consider data coalescing by ensuring g_data is accessed sequentially
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory reads
// Minimize inc_value access by storing it in a register before the loop
// Check and unroll loops if applicable for reducing instruction overhead
