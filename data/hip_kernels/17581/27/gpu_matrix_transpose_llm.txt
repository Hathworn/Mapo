// Consider using shared memory to cache a tile of the input matrix
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Ensure enough threads are launched such that each block handles a tile of the input matrix
// Avoid unnecessary recalculations by pre-computing repeated operations outside of loops
