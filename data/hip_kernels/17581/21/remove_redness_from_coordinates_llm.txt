// Ensure coalesced access by verifying the memory alignment of d_coordinates and other arrays.
// Consider using shared memory for template dimension values to reduce redundant global accesses.
// Use register variables for frequently accessed items like image_index_2d to minimize global memory access.
// Evaluate loop unrolling for x and y loops to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Assess using tile-based operations to enhance memory access patterns and utilize cache better.
