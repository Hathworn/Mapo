```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Load filter area into shared memory for faster access.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure threads are not accessing out-of-bound memory.
// Preload pixels in the boundary into shared memory if possible.
// Reduce redundant calculations by storing constants outside the loop.
