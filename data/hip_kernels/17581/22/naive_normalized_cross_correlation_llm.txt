// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Preload data into shared memory outside of the loop to reduce global memory access.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to synchronize threads only when necessary.
// Aggregate computations within loops before synchronization to improve parallelism.
// Consider loop unrolling for performance enhancement where possible.
