```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_coordinates to improve global memory throughput.
// Ensure d_r_output writes are coalesced for improved memory performance.
// Minimize divergence in loops by ensuring boundaries are handled outside the loop.
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data within the template region.
