```
// Cache image data in shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Use texture memory for accessing image data for improved cache utilization
// Unroll inner loops to reduce overhead and increase performance
// Use warp shuffle operations to compute sums across threads for better performance
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel by restructuring conditionals
// Consider using half precision if precision requirements allow to increase throughput
