```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data.
// Implement memory prefetching to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize shared memory usage to improve access speed within thread blocks.
// Explore using vectorized memory operations if supported by hardware.
// Balance thread block size and grid size for optimal occupancy.
