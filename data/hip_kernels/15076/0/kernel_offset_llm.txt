```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure blockDim.x does not exceed 256 to prevent shared memory overflow
// Load data into shared memory before processing to reduce global memory transactions
// Initialize offset[1] outside of main loop to avoid repeated execution
// Load previous key from shared memory to reduce global memory loads
// Correct previous element access in shared memory to leverage locality
// Perform boundary checks to avoid unnecessary global memory access
