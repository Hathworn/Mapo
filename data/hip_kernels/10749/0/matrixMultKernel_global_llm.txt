// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for tiled matrix multiplication
// Reduce global memory accesses by loading tiles into shared memory before computation
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by appropriate tiling and padding
