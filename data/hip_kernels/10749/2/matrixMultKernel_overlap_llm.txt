// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for Ad and Bd loads.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory for A_shared and B_shared access.
// Optimize conditional checks to reduce warp divergence.
// Prefetch global memory values into registers to further reduce global memory latency.
