```
// Ensure optimal memory coalescing by carefully aligning memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance.
// Optimize shared memory usage to maximize occupancy.
// Align data structures for better cache utilization.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of using vectorized memory operations.
// Consider increasing the TILE_SIZE if shared memory allows, for higher reuse.
// Use asynchronous memory transfers to hide memory latency.
