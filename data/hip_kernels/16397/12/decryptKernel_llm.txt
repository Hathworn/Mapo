```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce memory accesses to optimize memory throughput.
// Minimize branching and use predicated execution for conditional operations.
// Ensure alignment of memory access to improve performance.
// Consider using asynchronous copy operations for overlapping communication and computation.
