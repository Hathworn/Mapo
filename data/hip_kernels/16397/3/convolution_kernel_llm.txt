```
// Use coalesced accesses when loading input into shared memory
// Consider using constant memory for filter if it doesn't change
// Ensure shared memory bank conflicts are minimized
// Prefetch data into shared memory if applicable
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing data reuse in shared memory
// Consider using multiple streams to overlap computation and data transfer
