// Consider using shared memory for d_2d_cost_matrix to improve memory access efficiency.
// Optimize the sequential accesses to tmp_window to improve parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced access when reading d_ss and d_ts by adjusting memory access pattern.
// Align accesses to d_params to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory.
