```c
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access to global memory
// Ensure proper alignment for shared memory for optimal performance
// Consider using constant memory for d_params if it doesn't change and fits in the cache
// Reduce redundant calculations such as penalty * distance by storing the result in a variable
// Balance workload between threads to prevent some threads from idling
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
