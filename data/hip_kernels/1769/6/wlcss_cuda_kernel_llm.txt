```
// Move frequently accessed data to shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure proper synchronization of shared memory data
// Optimize use of registers by storing intermediate values in shared memory
// Use a stride loop for loading initial tmp_window into shared memory to balance load
// Minimize synchronization overhead by reorganizing shared memory updates
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved performance
// Use __shared__ memory for temporary storage to avoid redundant global reads
// Ensure data consistency by synchronizing threads before accessing shared data
// Write back results to global memory only after necessary computations are complete
// Clear shared memory to prepare for the next iteration and prevent stale data usage
