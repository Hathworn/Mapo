```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve memory bandwidth.
// Ensure coalesced access to d_ts and d_ss for better memory throughput.
// Optimize tmp_window indexing to reduce shared memory bank conflicts.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance.
// Ensure alignment of the memory accesses for d_mss, d_ts, and d_ss.
