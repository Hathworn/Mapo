```c
// Prioritize reducing global memory accesses by storing frequently accessed data in shared or local memory
// Arrange data in memory to ensure coalesced memory accesses and reduce memory transaction overhead
// Minimize the use of global memory and increase the use of registers for temporary variables to optimize performance
// Prefetch data from global memory that will be used in future iterations to hide latency
// Utilize warp-level primitives if beneficial for parallel data access patterns and minimize thread divergence
```
