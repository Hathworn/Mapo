```c
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for temporary variables.
// Allocate enough shared memory to eliminate bank conflicts.
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory for reducing waiting time on memory loads.
// Optimize the loop to minimize the number of calculations inside the nested loop.
// Consolidate memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce latency.
// Implement loop unrolling for the inner loop to enhance performance.
// Utilize __syncthreads() if necessary to prevent race conditions in shared memory.
// Use constant memory for parameters that do not change, e.g., reward, penalty, accepteddist.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize thread divergence and synchronization.
