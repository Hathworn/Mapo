```
// Consider using shared memory for tmp_window to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for arrays like d_mss_offsets for better performance.
// Use texture memory for frequently accessed arrays such as d_ts and d_ss if they exhibit spatial locality.
// Opt for loop unrolling in the inner loop to minimize loop control overhead.
// Use registers for variables like tmp and prev_tmp to reduce memory latency.
// Align d_params accesses if possible for improved memory access efficiency.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size to maximize the effective use of available resources.
