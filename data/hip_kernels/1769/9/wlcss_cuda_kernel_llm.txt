```
// Consider aligning data structures to optimize global memory access
// Explore using shared memory to cache d_2d_cost_matrix to reduce global memory accesses
// Use shared memory for d_ts and d_ss during distance calculations to improve memory bandwidth
// Implement thread coarsening to reduce the number of threads and increase the workload per thread
// Look into using warp-level primitives for reduction to improve performance
// Ensure strided access patterns are minimized for coalesced memory access
// Utilize the __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to ensure aggressiveness in compiler optimizations
