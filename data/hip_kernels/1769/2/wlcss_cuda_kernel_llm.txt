```
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures in global memory.
// Utilize warp-level primitives to minimize divergence and latency.
// Optimize the use of register variables to store frequently accessed values.
// Use loop unrolling for innermost loops to improve instruction throughput.
// Align memory access patterns to match the architecture's requirements.
// Balance thread workload by optimizing block and grid dimensions.
