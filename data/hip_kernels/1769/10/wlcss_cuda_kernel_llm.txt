```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory transfer efficiency.
// Utilize loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead.
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory.
// Use warp synchronization to avoid race conditions.
// Optimize memory access patterns for better cache efficiency.
// Use vectorized memory operations for aligned and efficient data transfers.
