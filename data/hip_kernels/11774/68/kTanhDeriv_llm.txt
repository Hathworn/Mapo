```
// Use shared memory if possible to further reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data properly
// Consider using vectorized loads for improved memory throughput
// Optimize grid and block size for better GPU occupancy
// Use __restrict__ pointers to enable compiler optimizations
