```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures properly
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access where applicable
// Evaluate if using float2 or float4 for vectorized access can improve throughput
// Optimize grid and block size configuration to maximize SM occupancy
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing data layout to favor warp execution
// Consider implementing loop unrolling for additional performance enhancement
