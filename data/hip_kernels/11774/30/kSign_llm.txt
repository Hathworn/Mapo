```
// Consider using shared memory if the data access pattern allows it to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure memory coalescing by checking if consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Evaluate if prefetching data to registers can benefit performance by reducing memory latency.
// Check if the use of __restrict__ for pointers helps the compiler with additional optimizations.
// Assess the grid and block size configurations to achieve maximum occupancy and hide memory latencies.
