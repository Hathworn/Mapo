```
// Utilize memory coalescing by using consecutive threads to write data continuously
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy
// Use shared memory if possible to improve memory access patterns
// Avoid memory bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Align data access to warp size to optimize throughput
