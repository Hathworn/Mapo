```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Unroll loops to improve memory access patterns
// Use a constant block size to ensure alignment
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing synchronization
// Keep synchronization points to a minimum
// Perform computations in registers to leverage faster access
```
