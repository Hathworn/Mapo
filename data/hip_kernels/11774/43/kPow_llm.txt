```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to take advantage of coalescing
// Employ loop unrolling as done for improved performance
// Consider using float4 for vectorized operations
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for GPU architecture
// Check for memory bank conflicts in shared memory usage
