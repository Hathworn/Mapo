```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data layout
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Consider vectorization by using float2 or float4 loads/stores
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce memory latency
// Avoid divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
