// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure that cur_sum variable is kept in registers for fast access
// Optimize loop increment stride by blockDim to minimize ineffective memory access
// Perform reduction in shared memory to minimize global memory writes
