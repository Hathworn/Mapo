```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within blocks is possible
// Align memory accesses to achieve coalesced memory access
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by using the optimal number of threads per block
