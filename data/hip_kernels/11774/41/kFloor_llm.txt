```
// Consider using shared memory for data accessed multiple times to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by keeping consecutive threads accessing consecutive memory locations
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers correctly to assist the compiler with optimizing memory access
// Optimize the loop further by increasing unroll factor if registers allow, considering register pressure
// Check boundary conditions to ensure all threads have valid data access, avoiding warp divergence
