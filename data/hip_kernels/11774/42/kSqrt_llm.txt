```
// Consider using shared memory for repetitive data access to reduce global memory load
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block and grid size for optimal performance 
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to help compiler optimize memory access patterns
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage if applied in future modifications
