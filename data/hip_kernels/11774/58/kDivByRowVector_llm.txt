```
// Consider coalesced memory access by reorganizing data layout for better global memory efficiency.
// Ensure vec is accessed in coalesced manner by using shared memory if possible.
// Experiment with different block size configurations to maximize warp utilization.
// Reduce divergent branching by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution paths.
// Minimize global memory access latency by using texture memory if applicable.
// Analyze memory bandwidth usage for potential bottlenecks and adjust thread/block ratio.
