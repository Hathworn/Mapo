// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Utilize loop unrolling for the inner loop to potentially increase performance.
// Minimize the use of conditionals within loop to reduce warp divergence.
