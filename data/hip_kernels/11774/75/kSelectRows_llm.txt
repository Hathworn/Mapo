```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for row indices
// Minimize the number of threads performing out-of-bound checks
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads() to manage shared memory access
// Avoid branching by handling invalid source indices efficiently
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns
