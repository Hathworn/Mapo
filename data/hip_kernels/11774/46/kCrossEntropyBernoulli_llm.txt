```
// Consider using shared memory to load chunks of mat and p to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the effectiveness of further loop unrolling as it may yield diminishing returns.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data and indexing patterns.
// Initialize tiny outside the loop if it's a constant to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
