// Use shared memory to store vec elements to optimize memory access
// Avoid repeated access of global memory by using shared memory for vec
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() after loading vec into shared memory
// Maximize the number of threads to cover the matrix width and height for better parallelism
