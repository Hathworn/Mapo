// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for faster access
// Align data accesses to memory boundaries for coalesced reads and writes
// Consider using float2 for accessing a and b if data is 2D for memory coalescing
// Ensure the number of threads matches warp size for performance optimization
// Check if memory padding could reduce misaligned accesses
// Use constant memory if 'a' and 'b' have static values for faster access
