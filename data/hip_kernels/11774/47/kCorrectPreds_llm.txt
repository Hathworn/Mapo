// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for coalesced access.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve performance.
// Check for potential memory bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data as much as possible.
// Apply loop unrolling if the iteration count is known to improve performance.
