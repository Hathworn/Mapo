```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved performance
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp take a similar path
// Consider increasing block size to enhance parallelism and memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory accesses
