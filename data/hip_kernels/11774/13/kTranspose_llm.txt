```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory accesses.
// Make sure COPY_BLOCK_SIZE matches with hardware constraints to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure coalesced reads by accessing idata in row-major order.
// Ensure coalesced writes by accessing odata in column-major order.
// Avoid excessive synchronization; __syncthreads() is used efficiently.
