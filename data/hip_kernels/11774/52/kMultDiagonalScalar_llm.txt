```cpp
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by using a calculated stride
// Use shared memory if there are frequent accesses to the same data
// Consider loop unrolling if width is known and constant
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use the __restrict__ qualifier for input and output pointers if no aliasing
// Consider optimizing the grid and block dimensions for the specific GPU architecture
