// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread access patterns.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Consider vectorization to improve memory throughput by using float4 or float2 types.
// Re-examine memory bank conflicts within shared memory to ensure optimal usage.
// Apply loop unrolling to enhance instruction throughput in the copy loop.
