```
// Use while loop to optimize looping and handle variable iteration counts
// Simplify calculations with modulo operator to reduce computational overhead
// Suggest compiler loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Use flattened thread index for direct access and reduced complexity
// Calculate total stride once to avoid redundant calculations during iteration
// Reduce memory accesses by computing indices directly instead of re-calculating
```
