```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure aligned memory operations.
// Ensure that vec array fits entirely into shared memory if possible.
// Use texture memory for vec if random access pattern benefits from this optimization.
// Evaluate if memory bank conflicts are present and attempt to minimize them.
