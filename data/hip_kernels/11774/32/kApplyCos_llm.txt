```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory transactions are contiguous to reduce memory bandwidth.
// Use __restrict__ to inform the compiler of non-aliasing pointers effectively.
// Ensure grid and block size are optimized for maximum occupancy.
