```
// Use more threads per block to potentially improve performance
// Consider using shared memory to decrease global memory access latency
// Check for coalesced memory access for better utilization of memory bandwidth
// Ensure memory alignment for faster data transfer
// Use the __restrict__ keyword to inform the compiler of non-aliasing memory access
