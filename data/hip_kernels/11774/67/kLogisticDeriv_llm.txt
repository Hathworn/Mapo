```
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block for better occupancy
// Use coalesced memory access to increase memory throughput
// Optimize the size of shared memory usage according to actual block size needs
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to avoid synchronization overhead
// Use read-only cache (const restrict qualifier) if data is read-only after loading
