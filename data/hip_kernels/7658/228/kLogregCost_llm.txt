```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that probs and labels are accessed in a stride pattern that matches the memory layout.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for maxProbs and possibly for probs if memory size permits.
// Opt for loop unrolling when iterating over numOut to enhance performance, especially if numOut is a small constant.
// Evaluate bank conflicts in shared memory access if shared memory is utilized and optimize accordingly.
// Prefer using warp-synchronous programming or intrinsics such as __shfl_xor for potential optimization in reductions or conditions.
