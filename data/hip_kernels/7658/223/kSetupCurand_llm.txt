```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Use shared memory appropriately if needed to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider the use of texture memory or read-only data cache for constant data
// Ensure proper alignment to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory
