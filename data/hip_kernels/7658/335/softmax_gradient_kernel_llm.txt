```
// Align memory access patterns for coalesced global memory reading.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Open possibilities for loop unrolling to enhance performance.
// Keep shared memory usage within limits to ensure maximal occupancy.
// Ensure warp-divergence minimization in reduction step.
