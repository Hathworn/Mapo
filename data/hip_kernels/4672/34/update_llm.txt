// Use shared memory to cache original and current values to reduce global memory access
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for faster data transfer between global memory and registers
// Optimize block and thread configuration for better warp utilization and occupancy  
// Investigate whether further loop unrolling or alternative strategies could reduce instruction overhead
