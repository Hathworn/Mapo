```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by using contiguous threads for consecutive data
// Minimize divergent code paths to improve warp efficiency
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access if the pattern allows
// Consider unrolling loop to increase instruction level parallelism if applicable
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency
```
