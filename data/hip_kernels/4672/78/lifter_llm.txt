```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Minimize global memory accesses by utilizing shared memory
// Use warp-level primitives for better synchronization
// Optimize loop unrolling to reduce overhead in computation
// Make use of vectorized operations for processing multiple data elements at once
```
