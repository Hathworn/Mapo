```
// Store smoothed[i] divided by nhalf in a temporary variable to avoid redundant division
// Use fabsf for single precision floating point absolute value
// Consider coalesced access to smoothed and nonSmoothed arrays for better memory throughput
// Minimize divergence in conditional statements by optimizing threshold logic
// Ensure that memory access patterns are efficient for the current GPU architecture
