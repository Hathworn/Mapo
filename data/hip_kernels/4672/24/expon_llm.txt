```
// Optimize memory access patterns and ensure coalesced memory operations
// Use shared memory if repeated access to the same data occurs to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
// Ensure enough threads per block to cover global memory latency effectively
```
