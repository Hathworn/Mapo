```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth
// Check if data alignment is optimal to avoid memory access penalties
// Explore using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling can provide additional performance gains
// Investigate if reducing precision from float to half could be beneficial
// Review the use of constant memory for any constants used across threads
