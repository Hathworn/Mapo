// Use shared memory to further optimize data access pattern
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing to minimize warp divergence
// Evaluate the use of constant memory for ampCoeff and freqCoeff if they are unchanged across kernels
// Explore loop unrolling techniques if applicable to improve performance
