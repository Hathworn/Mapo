```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access by aligning data to 64-byte boundaries if possible.
// Utilize __restrict__ qualifier to improve memory access by informing the compiler of non-aliasing.
