```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Minimize register usage by reusing variables when possible
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling if the loop is performance-critical
// Optimize grid and block sizes for maximum occupancy and throughput
// Prefetch data to reduce latency, if applicable
