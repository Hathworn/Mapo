// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning input and output accesses
// Consider using shared memory for input and output fragments if reuse is high
// Minimize divergence by reshaping control flow to avoid conditional branches 
// Evaluate using constant memory for alpha and beta if they do not change frequently
