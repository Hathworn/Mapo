```
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing calculated values.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data layout if possible.
// Use shared memory if the same data needs to be accessed by multiple threads.
// Consider loop unrolling for operations within each thread, if applicable.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy and performance.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory access latency.
