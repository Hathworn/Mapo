// Consider using shared memory to store frameA and frameB for better memory access patterns  
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring proper alignment of data structures  
// Use branchless techniques to minimize conditional branching within the kernel  
// Ensure threads are well-distributed across blocks to maintain optimal load balancing  
// Minimize divergence by evaluating the condition as a single atomic operation
