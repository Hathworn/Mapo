// Use grid stride loop for efficient parallelization across threads and blocks
// Ensure coalesced memory access by iterating linearly through env array
// Consider using shared memory if multiple accesses to env[i] are needed within the loop
// Ensure optimal block size to maximize occupancy and minimize memory latency
