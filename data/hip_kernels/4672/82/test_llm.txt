```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Pre-fetch data to registers to minimize latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth
// Align data structures to 32-byte boundaries for memory coalescing
// Use __ldg intrinsic for read-only cache accesses
// Optimize thread block sizes based on warp size for better utilization
