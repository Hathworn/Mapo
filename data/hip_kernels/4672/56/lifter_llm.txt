```
// Mitigate memory latency by ensuring all threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory if access patterns allow its effective use.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to enhance memory throughput.
// Consider adjusting the grid and block dimensions for better thread occupancy and performance.
// Evaluate the possibility of reducing the amount of divergence in conditional statements.
