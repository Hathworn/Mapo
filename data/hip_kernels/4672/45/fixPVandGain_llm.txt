```cpp
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize memory latency impacts.
// Consider using float2 to load/store two floats at once to optimize memory throughput.
// Ensure memory coalescing by having threads access continuous memory locations.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring control flow.
