```cpp
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for cepstrum to improve memory access optimization
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Try using shared memory if the data is reused within the block
// Check if loop unrolling could provide any benefits
// Evaluate if using float2 or similar data types could optimize vectorized operations
