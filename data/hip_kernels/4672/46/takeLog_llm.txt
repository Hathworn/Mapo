```
// Suggestion: Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Suggestion: Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning input and env arrays
// Suggestion: Ensure that the input data is properly aligned to avoid bank conflicts
// Suggestion: Consider using __restrict__ keyword for input and env pointers to enable compiler optimizations
// Suggestion: Minimize branch divergence by ensuring contiguous thread execution paths
