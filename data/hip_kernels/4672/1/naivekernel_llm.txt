```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Try to use vectorized data types like float4 where applicable
// Ensure the total number of threads covers the entire workload
// Optimize arithmetic operations and avoid branching where possible
