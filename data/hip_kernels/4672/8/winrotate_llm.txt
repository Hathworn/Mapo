```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning inframe and win in contiguous memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for win data
// Optimize thread block size for maximum occupancy and performance
// Consider using memory pre-fetching techniques for inframe data
// Minimize memory bank conflicts by aligning data properly in shared memory
