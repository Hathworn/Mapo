```
// Optimize global memory access by using shared memory for stride and index data.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate loop unrolling to decrease overhead in the update loop.
