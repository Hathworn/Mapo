```
// Consider using shared memory to cache res_stride and index for faster access.
// Reduce global memory access by minimizing the computations inside the loop.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory operations among threads.
// Use loop unrolling to optimize repeated calculations within the loop.
// Precompute constant values outside the loops to reduce repeated calculations.
