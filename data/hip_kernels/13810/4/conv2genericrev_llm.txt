```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses when loading input and kernel data to improve memory efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory effectively by ensuring data reuse and minimizing global memory access.
// Experiment with different block sizes and thread configurations to optimize occupancy and throughput.
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency.
// Implement loop unrolling in the convolution loop for better performance and efficient register usage.
