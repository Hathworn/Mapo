// Consider reducing the size of the shared memory buffer for better usage efficiency.
// Utilize bank conflict avoidance techniques in shared memory accesses to improve performance.
// Streamline memory access patterns within the loop for better coalesced memory transactions.
// Leverage warp-level reduction to enhance parallel reduction computation speed.
