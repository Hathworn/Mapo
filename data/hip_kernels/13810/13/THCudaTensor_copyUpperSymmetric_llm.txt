```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting data layout
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to help compiler optimize memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts if using shared memory
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for performance gains
// Consider using asynchronous memory copies if applicable
```
