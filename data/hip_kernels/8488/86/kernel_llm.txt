```
// Use coalesced memory access while loading data into shared memory
// Ensure proper boundary checks to avoid memory access violations
// Consider using loop unrolling to improve reduction performance
// Minimize syncthreads usage by optimizing reduction pattern
// Accumulate results gradually to minimize divergence and improve efficiency
