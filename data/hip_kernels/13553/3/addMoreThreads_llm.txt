```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Ensure data is aligned to avoid memory divergence
// Evaluate shared memory use to reduce global memory access latency
// Strive for occupancy balance by adjusting block size and grid size
// Investigate warp divergence and try to minimize it
