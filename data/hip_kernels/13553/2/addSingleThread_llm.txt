```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring x and y arrays are allocated in memory-aligned fashion.
// Ensure the data is contiguous in memory to optimize for the memory access pattern.
// If possible, utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to minimize global memory accesses.
// Prefetch data into registers if usage pattern allows, to reduce latency in accessing global memory.
// Check if using larger data types could improve load/store efficiency by reducing the number of memory transactions.
