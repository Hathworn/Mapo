```
// Consider using shared memory to cache submatrices to reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize thread coarsening by having each thread compute multiple elements of C to improve memory throughput
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance
// Explore loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve performance
```
