```
// Consider coalescing accesses to aptr and bptr to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure int cmp is stored in a register for faster access.
// Verify alignment of data for optimal memory throughput.
// Prefetch data if possible to hide global memory latency.
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed values.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads execute similar paths.
