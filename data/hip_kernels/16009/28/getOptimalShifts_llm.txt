```c
// Avoid branch divergence by using early returns for out-of-bounds checks.
// Leverage pointer arithmetic to minimize repetitive memory calculations.
// Unroll loops if applicable to reduce loop overhead and branch instructions.
// Align data structures to improve coalesced memory access and throughput.
// Pre-calculate frequently used values outside loops to reduce register pressure.
// Minimize the use of global memory in favor of shared memory where possible.
// Consider loop fusion techniques to merge multiple loops and reduce kernel launch overhead.
