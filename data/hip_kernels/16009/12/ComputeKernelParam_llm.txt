```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using float3 pointer for kernelImg
// Minimize divergent control flow by aligning if-conditions to thread warps
// Precompute repeated operations outside the thread blocks if possible
// Use shared memory if the kernelImg size allows for faster memory access
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data to make use of cache
// Optimize boundary checks to reduce thread divergence
