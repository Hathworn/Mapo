```
// Use texture memory for coalesced and cache-friendly memory accesses
// Precompute values that are reused across calculations to minimize redundancy
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid performance penalties
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory traffic
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable for further optimization of repetitive operations
