```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache neighborhood pixel data to reduce global memory access.
// Use texture memory for raw image data when access patterns exhibit 2D spatial locality for improved cache efficiency.
// Investigate using memory coalescing by aligning data accesses for raw images across threads to reduce memory transactions.
// Consider unrolling the inner loop completely for the neighborhood pixel computation to reduce branch overhead.
// Precompute any repeated calculations such as scale factors to save computation time inside the loop.
// Maximize the usage of registers instead of shared memory for temporary variables to leverage faster access speeds.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring calculations and conditions are uniform across threads.
