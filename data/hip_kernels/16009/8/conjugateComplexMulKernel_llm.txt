// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved bandwidth utilization
// Consider using shared memory for repeated data to reduce global memory access
// Minimize shared memory use to prevent bank conflicts
// Use vectorized operations if possible to increase arithmetic throughput
// Avoid divergent execution paths for better warp efficiency
// Optimize memory access patterns to align with memory coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling for the main computation to reduce overhead
