```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access sequential elements in memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for frequently accessed data
// Prefer using __restrict__ for kernel parameters to enhance compiler optimizations
// Ensure loop unrolling where possible for operations within the kernel to increase performance
// Minimize divergence by restructuring conditional statements when possible
// Use registers for temporary variables to improve access speed
// Consider using texture memory for read-heavy data to benefit from caching
