```c
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory performance.
// Ensure alignment of float3 structures for efficient memory access.
// Minimize the use of reinterpret_cast for better type safety and potential performance improvements.
// Explore using shared memory if frequent access to the same data is required.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory accesses if introduced.
