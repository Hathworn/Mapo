```
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring matrix A and B elements are loaded contiguously.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts in tileA and tileB.
// Reuse loaded data in registers to minimize shared memory access.
// Optimize loop unrolling for kernel performance improvement.
// Ensure TILE_WIDTH is aligned with the GPU architecture's warp size for optimal performance.
// Consider loop fusion techniques to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate and adjust block size for maximum occupancy and efficiency.
