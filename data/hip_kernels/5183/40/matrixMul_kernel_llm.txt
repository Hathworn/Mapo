```
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning the threads in each warp properly.
// Consider using a stride of TILE_SIZE to access elements in shared memory to minimize conflicts.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to ensure proper synchronization across threads.
