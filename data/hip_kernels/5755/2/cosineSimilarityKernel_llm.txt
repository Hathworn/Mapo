```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for norms caching.
// Consider loop unrolling to optimize the inner loop for better performance.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize repeated global memory accesses.
// Optimize the block and thread configurations to better utilize GPU resources.
// Check for memory coalescing opportunities to improve bandwidth utilization.
