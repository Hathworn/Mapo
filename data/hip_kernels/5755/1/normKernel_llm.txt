```
// Consider coalescing global memory access by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory elements
// Analyze the need to use shared memory for vectors to minimize global memory bandwidth usage and latency
// Review loop unrolling opportunities to enhance performance of the inner loop operations
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned, which can improve memory access efficiency
// Examine possibilities to optimize memory access patterns for better cache utilization
