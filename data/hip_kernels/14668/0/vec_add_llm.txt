```
// Ensure A, B, and C pointers are aligned to facilitate coalesced memory access
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to allow for compiler optimizations
// Use shared memory if repeated access to a section of global memory is necessary
// Optimize block size based on hardware specifics to fully utilize available resources
// Ensure grid size is set to cover the entire data set for effective parallel execution
// Minimize divergent branching within the kernel
