// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure proper memory coalescing to enhance memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate if reducing the number of threads can improve warp efficiency.
// Analyze the use of warp-shuffle functions for data exchange within a warp.
// Check alignment of data structures for better memory efficiency.
