```cpp
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to optimize memory access if no aliasing occurs
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Ensure memory is coalesced by aligning access patterns
// Double-check if loop unrolling could provide benefits
// Evaluate effectiveness of increasing block size or number of threads per block
