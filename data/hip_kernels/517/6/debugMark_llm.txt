```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory reads
// Ensure memory access patterns align with memory requirements for optimal performance
// Experiment with loop unrolling to enhance GPU utilization
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization to reduce overhead
