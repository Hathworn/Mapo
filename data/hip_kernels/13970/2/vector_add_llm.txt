```
// Consider using shared memory for reused data to reduce global memory access time.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data on 32-byte boundaries.
// Minimize divergence by using warp-synchronous programming.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to improve compiler optimization.
