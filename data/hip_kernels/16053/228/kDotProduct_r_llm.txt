// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays a and b
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing __syncthreads()
// Consider using a warp shuffle for faster reduction within a warp
// Ensure alignment of data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Load data in continuous blocks to maximize memory bandwidth usage
