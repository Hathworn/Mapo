```c
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize access patterns and reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in tgt array.
// Use appropriate block size and grid size to fully optimize hardware occupancy and minimize thread divergence.
// Prefetch data to registers when possible to minimize latency in accessing global memory.
