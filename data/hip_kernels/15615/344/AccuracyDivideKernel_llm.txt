// Consider using shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure alignment of data in memory for potential coalesced access.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could optimize performance for large N.
// Use __restrict__ keyword to potentially improve compiler optimization.
