```
// Coalesced access to normDistPrefixSum can improve memory throughput.
// Reduce divergent branches in binarySearchForMultinomial function.
// Consider using shared memory for the normDistPrefixSum within a block for faster access.
// Avoid bank conflicts by using padding in shared memory if implemented.
// Ensure access to origDist is coalesced for better performance.
