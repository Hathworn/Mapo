```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for input and output
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed kernel weights
// Apply loop unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Align shared memory size to avoid padding overheads
// Utilize fast intrinsic functions if applicable
// Overlap computation and memory fetch with double buffering
```
