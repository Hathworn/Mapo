```
// Consider using shared memory to cache normDistPrefixSum for each block to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced access by having threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations in dest.
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing the number of variables declared inside the inner loop.
// Utilize loop unrolling in the sample loop to increase instruction-level parallelism and reduce loop overhead.
