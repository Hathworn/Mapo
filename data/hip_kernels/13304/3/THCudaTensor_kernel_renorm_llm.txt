```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align data accesses to maximize memory coalescing.
// Ensure all threads have written their local sums before reduction.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads during reduction.
// Access shared memory efficiently to avoid bank conflicts.
// Perform normalization in the first thread to minimize redundant computations.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring conditional statements are simple and uniform.
// Ensure synchronization after computing the normalization factor.
