// Consider optimizing shared memory usage by adjusting its size dynamically based on block dimensions
// Use __shared__ memory cautiously as each thread in a block accesses the same location
// Evaluate if atomic operations are needed; try reducing their use for better performance
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced for improved memory throughput
// Avoid using atomicMax and atomicAdd inside critical performance loops if possible
// Verify synchronization usage (__syncthreads()) to prevent unnecessary delays between threads
