// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better throughput, if possible.
// Review any potential for shared memory usage to minimize global memory access latency.
// Assess whether loop unrolling could yield performance benefits for small computations within the kernel.
// Ensure alignment of data to optimize memory transactions and avoid potential bank conflicts.
