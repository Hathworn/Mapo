// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory addresses for d0, c2, and out arrays.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like neighboring values of c2.
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp to enhance performance.
// Consider prefetching neighboring values of c2 to reduce memory latency.
