```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads if multiple threads access nearby data.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments if no aliasing occurs to allow for further compiler optimization.
// Ensure optimal thread block size by profiling for the specific GPU architecture being targeted.
