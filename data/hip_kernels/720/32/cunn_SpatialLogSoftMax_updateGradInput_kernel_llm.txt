```
// Ensure optimal memory access patterns by coalescing memory reads and writes
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if feature_size and spatial_size are manageable
// Consider using half precision if precision requirements allow, to boost performance on supported hardware
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives to further optimize the reduction operation
// Check if reducing redundant computation using __syncthreads() in shared memory is feasible
