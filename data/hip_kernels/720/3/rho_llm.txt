// Consider using __restrict__ pointer qualifiers for x to improve memory access.
// Load lambda into cached_lambda outside the loop if it remains constant across kernel invocations.
// Prefetch elements of x into local variables or registers if possible for faster access.
// Ensure optimal thread block size for better occupancy and efficiency.
