// Consider coalescing memory access by aligning data structures to be coalesced naturally
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Ensure all memory allocations are contiguous for improving access speed
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data to achieve higher performance through caching
// Ensure proper memory alignment to achieve optimal performance with memory transactions
