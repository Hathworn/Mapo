```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to reduce contention and improve performance.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for better memory throughput.
// Use float2 or float4 types to read/write data when possible for reduced memory transactions.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimal for the target hardware.
