```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if data reuse is present
// Optimize access pattern by ensuring coalesced memory accesses
// Ensure kernel execution configuration (block size) is optimized for GPU architecture
// Verify that memory accesses respect alignment requirements for best performance
// Evaluate potential use of vectorized memory loads if data alignment allows
