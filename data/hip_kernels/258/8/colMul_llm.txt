// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations.
// Optimize block and grid size to ensure high occupancy and minimize execution divergence.
// Evaluate the use of `__restrict__` to reflect memory aliasing and potentially improve performance.
