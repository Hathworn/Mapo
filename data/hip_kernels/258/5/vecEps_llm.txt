```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Consider memory coalescing techniques to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if possible to inform the compiler about non-aliasing pointers.
// Optimize for cache reuse and minimize global memory access latency.
// Consider loop unrolling to increase loop efficiency if applicable.
