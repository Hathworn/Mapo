// Consider using shared memory to load chunks of b to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by following alignment in accessing global memory.
// Optimize block and thread dimensions for better occupancy and performance.
// Consider loop tiling if data size exceeds shared memory limitations.
