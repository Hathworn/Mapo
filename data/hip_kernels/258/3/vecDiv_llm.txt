```cpp
// Suggest using coalesced memory access for a[]
// Consider aligning shared memory allocation for better performance
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory
// Opt to use warp-level primitives for reducing __syncthreads() overhead
// Recommend minimizing shared memory usage if bandwidth is not a limiting factor
```
