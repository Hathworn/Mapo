// Use __restrict__ to enable compiler optimizations on pointers
// Unroll loop to minimize loop control overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal global memory bandwidth usage
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data that is reused across threads
