// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency and improve throughput.
// Consider increasing shared memory size if blockDim.x is larger than current allocation.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used properly to avoid race conditions during shared memory access.
// Investigate optimal block size to balance between occupancy and shared memory usage.
