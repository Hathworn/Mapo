```
// Consider optimizing memory access by using coalesced access patterns in global memory.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access to improve performance.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize branch divergence during repeated operations.
// Exploit occupancy by ensuring kernel configuration matches hardware resources.
