```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access
// Ensure memory alignment for optimized memory access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Use constant memory for small, frequently accessed variables
