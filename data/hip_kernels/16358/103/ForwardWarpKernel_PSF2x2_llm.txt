```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for reducing global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses to achieve better memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches to ensure efficient warp execution
// Use vectorized loads and stores where possible to improve memory access efficiency
