```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency.
// Shared memory can be further optimized by tuning block size.
// Consider using vectorized operations for better memory throughput.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for x and y arrays.
// Experiment with different grid and block dimensions for optimal performance.
