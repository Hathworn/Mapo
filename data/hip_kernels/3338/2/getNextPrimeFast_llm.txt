```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Align shared memory to a 32-byte boundary
// Coalesce global memory accesses for dev_chunk
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Implement a loop unrolling technique for better performance
