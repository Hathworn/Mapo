```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for dev_chunk if memory access is not coalesced
// Use __restrict__ for pointers to aid compiler optimizations
// Unroll the loop to increase instruction throughput
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory access patterns
// Prefetch data into registers for faster access within the loop
