```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to reduce memory latency
// Ensure inputs 'a' and 'b' are stored in contiguous memory blocks
// Consider using shared memory for frequent access data
// Optimize block and grid sizes for target GPU architecture
// Ensure proper memory alignment to reduce access overhead
