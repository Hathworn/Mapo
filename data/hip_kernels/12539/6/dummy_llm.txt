```
// Consider using shared memory for data that is reused across threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing to ensure that loads and stores are aligned and contiguous to enhance memory throughput.
// Use memory access patterns that maximize use of L2 cache to reduce latency.
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by using local variables where possible.
