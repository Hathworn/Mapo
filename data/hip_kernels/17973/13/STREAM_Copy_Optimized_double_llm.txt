// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Utilize shared memory if applicable for frequent data reuse
// Align memory accesses to cache line size to prevent memory access conflicts
// Assess usage of loop unrolling to reduce overhead and enhance throughput
// Review the use of warp-level primitives for efficient intra-warp communication
