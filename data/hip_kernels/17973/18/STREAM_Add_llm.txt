// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Optimize thread block sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize memory latency
// Reduce synchronization overhead by limiting syncthreads usage where possible
