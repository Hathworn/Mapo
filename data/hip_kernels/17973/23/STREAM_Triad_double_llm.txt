```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Experiment with memory padding to avoid bank conflicts
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Use asynchronous memory copy to overlap computation and data transfer
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Leverage registers by minimizing reads and writes to global memory
// Analyze and optimize the stride size for efficient access pattern
// Profile cache utilization and optimize array alignment
