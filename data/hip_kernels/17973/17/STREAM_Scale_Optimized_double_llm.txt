// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures.
// Use shared memory if data reuse is possible within a block.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead from loop control.
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize global memory reads and writes.
// Prefer warp-level primitives if applicable for further optimization.
