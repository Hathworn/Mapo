```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns
// Use shared memory if data reuse is possible within the block
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to maximize the use of available SMs
// Consider vectorized loads/stores if the hardware supports it
// Prefetch data if kernel execution is memory-bound to hide latency
// Minimize divergence within warp execution to maintain efficiency
