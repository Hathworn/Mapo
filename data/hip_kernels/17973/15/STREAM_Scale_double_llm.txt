```
// Unrolling loop to improve memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data access to optimize coalesced memory access
// Ensure memory access is within the limits of the allocated buffers
// Evaluate occupancy to determine optimal block size and grid size
