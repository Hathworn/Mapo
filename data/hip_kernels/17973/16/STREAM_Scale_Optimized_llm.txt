```
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to improve occupancy
// Ensure shared memory size is sufficient for blockDim.x threads
// Use __syncthreads() after loading data to ensure all threads have completed loading before proceeding
// Reduce register usage if possible to allow more threads per block for better parallelism
// Align memory accesses for a and b to minimize coalesced memory access overhead
