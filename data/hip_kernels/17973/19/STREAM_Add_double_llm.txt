```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better global memory throughput
// Consider using restrict keyword to help compiler optimize memory access
// Use shared memory if intermediate calculations are needed to minimize global memory latency
// Evaluate use of asynchronous memory prefetching to improve data availability
// Consider tuning block and grid size based on target hardware for optimal occupancy
