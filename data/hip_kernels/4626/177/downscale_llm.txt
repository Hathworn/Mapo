// Implement shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory access patterns
// Use memory coalescing techniques to optimize read/write operations for gradOutput_data
// Test different block sizes to find the optimal thread configuration for this kernel
// Explore using warp-level primitives for more efficient intra-warp data sharing and reduction
