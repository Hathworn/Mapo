```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure memory is accessed in a contiguous pattern for better performance.
// Reduce the frequency of synchronization barriers to minimize performance overhead.
// Consider launching multiple blocks to handle larger data sets for improved parallelism.
