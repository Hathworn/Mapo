```
// Consider using shared memory efficiently by optimizing the size and reducing bank conflicts.
// Minimize global memory reads by caching necessary data in shared memory.
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced global memory reads and writes.
// Look into possible ways to reduce synchronization overhead in global kernel execution.
// Ensure that the number of threads utilized fits the problem size to maximize hardware utilization.
// Analyze the block size and grid configuration to optimize parallel computation efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of atomics and explore alternative algorithms to avoid serialization in data access.
