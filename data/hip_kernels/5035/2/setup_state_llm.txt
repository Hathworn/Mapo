```
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure seed is different for each launch to maintain randomness
// Consider aligning state array to improve memory coalescing
// Optimize block and grid size for better GPU utilization
// Use __constant__ memory for frequently accessed constant data
// Profile the kernel to identify and reduce bank conflicts
