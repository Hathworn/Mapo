```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Reorder memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Focus on optimizing memory access patterns for dUD and related arrays
// Use constexpr for constant expressions to allow for better compiler optimization
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can benefit performance by reducing branch overhead
// Ensure that thread block and grid sizes are optimized for device architecture
