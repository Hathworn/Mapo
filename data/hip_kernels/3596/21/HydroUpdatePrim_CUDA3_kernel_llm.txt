// Use shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure all read and write operations are coalesced for better memory performance.
// Utilize loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and increase performance.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to prevent pointer aliasing and optimize memory access.
