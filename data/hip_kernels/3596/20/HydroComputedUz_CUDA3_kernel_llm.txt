```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Consider loop unrolling for operations involving continuous memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring neighboring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform branching within warp execution
// Use constant memory for read-only data that doesn't change and is accessed multiple times
