```cpp
// Use shared memory for temporary storage to improve memory access coalescing
// Ensure all access patterns are coalesced to maximize memory throughput
// Consider prefetching data to registers to reduce repeated global memory access
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop for better warp execution
// Align data access to avoid non-aligned memory operations
```
