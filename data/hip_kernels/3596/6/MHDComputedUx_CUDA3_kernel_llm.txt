```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize register usage to avoid register spilling.
// Ensure memory alignment for coalesced access.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel.
// Use float4 or float2 loads/stores to improve memory access efficiency.
// Prefetch data before performing computations to hide memory latency.
