```
// Combine grid index calculations into fewer operations to reduce register pressure
// Consolidate read/write operations to minimize memory latency
// Use shared memory for commonly accessed data to speed up memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches to maximize warp efficiency
