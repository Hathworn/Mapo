```
// Consider alignment and coalescing for memory access to Flux arrays for better performance.
// Use shared memory or texture cache for frequent access data to reduce global memory reads.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring that conditional branches align with warp execution.
// Investigate whether loop unrolling could further optimize the computation of indices.
// Profile memory bandwidth usage to identify potential bottlenecks in memory access patterns.
