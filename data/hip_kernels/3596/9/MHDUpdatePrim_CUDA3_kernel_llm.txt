```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve performance.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied for vectorized operations.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to ensure maximum occupancy.
// Investigate using registers for frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
// Assess if use of atomic operations is necessary or can be refactored for better parallelism.
// Profile memory access pattern to identify misaligned accesses and re-align if necessary.
