```
// Consider coalesced access to improve memory throughput
// Place frequently accessed data in shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads if necessary
// Ensure that idx lies within the valid range to prevent out-of-bound memory access
// Unroll loops where applicable within the kernel to enhance performance
