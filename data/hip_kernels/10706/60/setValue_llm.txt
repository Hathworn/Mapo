```
// Use shared memory to store repetitive data access patterns for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider using cooperative groups to enable efficient synchronization within warps
// Ensure data alignment to maximize coalesced memory access
// Utilize vectorized data types, like float2 or float4, to reduce memory transaction overhead
