```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure data alignment to avoid unaligned access penalties.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block.
// Balance occupancy and resource utilization (registers, shared memory).
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel.
// Opt for the use of __restrict__ to optimize pointer aliasing.
