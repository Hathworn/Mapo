```c
// Use shared memory for temporary data storage to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing data[] with continuous indices when possible
// Consider optimizing block and grid size for the target GPU architecture
// Minimize use of global memory to improve kernel performance
```
