// Consider using shared memory for data that is accessed frequently
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve performance
// Use float4 or float2 loads/stores to decrease memory transaction overhead
// Reduce memory divergence among threads to maximize bandwidth utilization
