```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate values if applicable
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data in registers
// Optimize the number of blocks and threads configuration
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for performance increase
```
