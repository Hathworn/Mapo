// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing sequential data elements in adjacent threads
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming for further optimization
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance
// Check memory alignment for better performance and avoid bank conflicts
