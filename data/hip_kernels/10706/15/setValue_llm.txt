```cpp
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need to read common data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns by aligning memory access with warp boundaries if extending the functionality.
// Evaluate the need for atomic operations if multiple threads may write to the same index concurrently.
// Assess whether using multiple warps or blocks can enhance performance based on workload distribution.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions considering the GPU architecture and workload characteristics.
