```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Check for alignment to reduce access time.
// Consider using shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access time.
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp.
// Optimize block and grid sizes for your specific hardware architecture.
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques if applicable.
