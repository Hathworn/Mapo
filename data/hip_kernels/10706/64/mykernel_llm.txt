```
// Consider increasing the use of shared memory to store multiple elements for coalesced access
// Ensure data type alignment in shared memory to improve access speed
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
//尝试在循环中合并内存访问来减少频繁的全局内存读写
// Consider launching more threads per block to make better use of SM resources
