```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better bandwidth utilization
// Explore using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider increasing block size to improve occupancy and parallelism
// Ensure data alignment to maximize memory throughput
// Analyze if loop unrolling can be applied for further optimization
// Optimize for more threads per block for increased efficiency
