```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize thread block size for better memory coalescing.
// Ensure data is aligned to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using float4 for memory transactions if applicable.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
