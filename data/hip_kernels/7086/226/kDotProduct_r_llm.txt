```c
// Use a register for accumulation to minimize memory access latency
// Optimize loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput
// Use shared memory to store partial results and reduce global memory access
// Optimize reduction using warp shuffling to maximize parallel processing
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory access patterns
// First thread writes the reduced result to global memory to minimize memory traffic
