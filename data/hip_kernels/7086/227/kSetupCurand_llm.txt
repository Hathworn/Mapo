```
// Use shared memory to cache data frequently accessed by all threads
// Reduce memory transactions by ensuring coalesced accesses in global memory
// Implement loop unrolling for repeated operations to reduce overhead
// Consider using local memory for variables that are privately used by the thread
// Evaluate warp-level primitives to improve parallel execution efficiency
// Investigate memory alignment to improve access speed and reduce cache misses
