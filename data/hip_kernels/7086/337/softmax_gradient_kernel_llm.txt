```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses
// Perform loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Utilize parallel reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring proper stride access
