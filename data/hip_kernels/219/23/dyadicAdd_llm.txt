```
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations.
// Reduce memory access latency by using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data.
// Optimize index calculations to minimize arithmetic operations within the loop.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by ensuring all threads in a warp satisfy the boundary condition.
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop has a predictable and fixed number of iterations.
// Prefetch data to minimize waiting times for memory loads.
