```cpp
// Consider aligning data accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branching for better parallel efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory for intermediate calculations if possible.
// Explore opportunities for loop unrolling to reduce the overhead.
