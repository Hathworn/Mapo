```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking memory alignment
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing frequently used data in registers
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to help compiler optimize memory accesses
// Use warp shuffling to reduce reliance on atomic operations where possible
// Optimize loop unrolling for potential performance improvement
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by balancing thread block size and register usage
// Utilize texture memory for potential cache benefits with specific access patterns
