```
// Consider using shared memory for bin_counters to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access to vec array.
// Avoid conditional statements where possible to reduce branching and improve warp efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() strategically if using shared memory for synchronization.
// Analyze warp divergence caused by if conditions and optimize block size accordingly.
