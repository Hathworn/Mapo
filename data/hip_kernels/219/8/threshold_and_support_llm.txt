```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Check for memory bank conflicts and optimize access patterns if necessary
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where applicable
// Explore using vectorized memory loads/stores to optimize data movement
// Profile the kernel for warp divergence and optimize control flow
