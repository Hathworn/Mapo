```c
// Ensure that data is aligned and coalesced for better memory access efficiency.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data occur within a block.
// Reduce the number of memory accesses by using registers to store intermediate values if possible.
