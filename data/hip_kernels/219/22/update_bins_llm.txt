```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Minimize divergent branches by reordering conditional statements
// Pre-calculate commonly used values such as intercept * 0.000001f outside of kernel
// Merge conditional checks to reduce code branching where possible
// Utilize vectorized memory operations if applicable to improve memory throughput
// Group atomic operations and minimize usage if possible for performance improvement
