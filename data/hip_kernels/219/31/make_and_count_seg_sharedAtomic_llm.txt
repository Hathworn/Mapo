```
// Use shared memory for counters to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for vec and bin to maximize memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling in MakeCountSegment_sharedAtomic to improve execution efficiency.
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() after initializing shared memory.
// Evaluate memory bank conflicts in shared memory access to avoid serialization.
