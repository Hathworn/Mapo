```
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable to increase parallel efficiency
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Minimize use of atomic operations to reduce contention and improve throughput
// Align memory accesses to optimize coalescing
// Ensure memory accesses are within the same cache line to improve cache efficiency
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency
