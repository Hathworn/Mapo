// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to improve memory access performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads to access contiguous memory locations.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block and thread dimensions for better utilization of GPU resources.
// Experiment with using shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access.
