```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Consider using warp shuffle to minimize divergence
// Evaluate if using constant memory is beneficial for read-only data
// Profile the code to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly
