```
// Consider increasing the shared memory size if `nCoeff` changes
// Optimize memory transactions by leveraging shared memory for repeated access to CA
// Use atomic operations only when necessary to minimize performance overhead
// Ensure loop unrolling aligns with memory access patterns to fully utilize memory bandwidth
