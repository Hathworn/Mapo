// Optimize global memory access by minimizing redundant reads/writes
// Use shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory access
// Explore loop unrolling for both inner loops to improve performance
// Consider using atomic operations if race conditions need to be avoided when writing to SA
// Align data arrays in memory for better memory coalescing
