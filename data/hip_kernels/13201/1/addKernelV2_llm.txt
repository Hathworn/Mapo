// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for optimal memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that all threads within a warp read contiguous memory locations to improve memory coalescence.
// Use shared memory to stage data if there is any opportunity for re-use within the block to reduce global memory accesses.
