// Ensure coalesced memory access by writing pos using y * width + x pattern
// Consider using shared memory for frequent data reuse, like sine and cosine calculations
// Minimize arithmetic operations by precomputing constants like 2.0f - 1.0f for uv calculation
// Optimize boundary checking to potentially reduce divergent branches
// Evaluate benefits of loop unrolling if applicable for operations inside the if block
