// Consider coalesced memory access by using contiguous memory patterns.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access when possible.
// Check for potential bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit the kernel performance.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy.
