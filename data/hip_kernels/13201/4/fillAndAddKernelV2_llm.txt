```
// Consider using shared memory for sin and cos calculations to minimize redundant computations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous threads to access contiguous memory addresses.
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning shared memory usage to warp boundaries.
// Utilize loop unrolling techniques if processing multiple elements per thread to enhance throughput.
// Explore the feasibility of using half precision if precision requirements allow, to reduce memory bandwidth.
