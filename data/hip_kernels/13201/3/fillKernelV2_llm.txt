// Consider coalesced memory access for writing to arrays a and b
// Use shared memory to store sin_val and cos_val to reduce redundant calculations
// Ensure enough threads per block to hide memory latency by increasing occupancy
// Investigate alignment of arrays a and b to reduce possible misalignment issues
