// Consider using coalesced global memory access for array 'a' and 'b' to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory more effectively to reduce bandwidth pressure on global memory
// Implement loop unrolling for the dot product computation to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous memory transactions to reduce memory latency
