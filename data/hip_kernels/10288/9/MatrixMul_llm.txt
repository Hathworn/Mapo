```
// Consider coalesced global memory accesses for Md and Nd.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to hint no aliasing.
// Consider loop unrolling for the k-loop in tile multiplication.
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent warp divergence.
// Preload the next tile in the same stream for overlapping data transfer and computation.
// Consider using mixed-precision arithmetic if applicable for performance gain.
