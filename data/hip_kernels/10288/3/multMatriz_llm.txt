```
// Consider using shared memory to cache tile submatrices of da and db to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling to decrease the loop overhead when computing dot products.
// Optimize thread and block indices to ensure coalesced memory access patterns.
// Minimize bank conflicts when loading data into shared memory by using padding if necessary.
// Ensure each thread writes to contiguous memory locations in dc to improve memory throughput.
