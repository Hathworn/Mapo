// Use shared memory to store submatrices for faster access
// Coalesce global memory accesses for db by accessing sequential threads
// Consider loop unrolling to improve the throughput of loop iterations
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory is accessed efficiently
// Minimize thread divergence by organizing workloads appropriately
