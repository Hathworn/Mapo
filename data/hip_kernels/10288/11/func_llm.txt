```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for someGlobalArray for improved memory throughput
// Evaluate if shared memory bank conflicts are present and optimize accordingly
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if applicable to allow for compiler optimizations
// Analyze if loop unrolling can benefit performance and apply if appropriate
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block size based on available resources
