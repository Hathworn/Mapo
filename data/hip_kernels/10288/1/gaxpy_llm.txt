```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for a, x, and y
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing allocated size
// Reuse shared memory more efficiently between iterations if possible
// Implement loop unrolling for the reduction to improve performance
// Evaluate the use of warp shuffle for reduction to minimize synchronization
