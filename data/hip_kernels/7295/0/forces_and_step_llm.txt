```
// Consider using shared memory to store body data within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Load multiple bodies' data at once to take advantage of coalesced memory access.
// Employ loop unrolling in the inner loop to minimize loop control overhead and increase ILP.
// Ensure that memory access patterns are coalesced to maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate the use of prefetching data to reduce the impact of memory latency.
