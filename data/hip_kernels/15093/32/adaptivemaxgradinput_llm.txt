```
// Consider coalesced memory access for gradOutput, gradInput, indices_x, indices_y to enhance memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that reads and writes to global memory are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Optimize for cache usage by ensuring data locality; try to load data into shared memory if possible.
// Minimize the utilization of divergent branches to enhance execution efficiency.
