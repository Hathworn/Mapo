// Consider reducing the usage of atomic operations for better performance
// Minimize memory access latency by optimizing the memory access pattern
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize the thread block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
