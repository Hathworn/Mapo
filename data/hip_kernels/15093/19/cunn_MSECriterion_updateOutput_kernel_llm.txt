```
// Consider using memory coalescing by aligning input_k and target_k accesses
// Evaluate if using shared memory efficiently reduces the number of global memory accesses
// Consider unrolling more if hardware resources allow, e.g., by a factor greater than 4
// Prioritize warp-synchronous programming to minimize shared memory usage
// Ensure atomicAdd does not become a bottleneck; consider hierarchical reduction or atomic operations per block
