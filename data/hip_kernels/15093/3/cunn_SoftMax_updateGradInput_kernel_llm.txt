```
// Load data into shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Use warp-level reductions to optimize sum calculations across threads.
// Ensure that shared memory usage is efficient, avoiding bank conflicts.
// Consider increasing coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate the potential usage of atomic operations for precise reductions.
