```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Consider using texture memory for repeated input data access to improve cache hits.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding to avoid multiple threads accessing the same memory bank.
// Minimize global memory accesses by computing multiple elements per thread using loop unrolling.
// Use aligned memory access to maximize global memory transactions.
