// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve better memory coalescing
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data as much as possible
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations to maximize bandwidth utilization
