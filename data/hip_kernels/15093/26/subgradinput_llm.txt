```
// Consider using shared memory to improve memory access speed and reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for ptr_gradInput and ptr_gradOutput by optimizing thread indexing.
// Minimize arithmetic operations inside the loop by pre-computing invariant expressions outside.
// Reduce global memory transactions by considering efficient memory layout for gradInput and gradOutput.
