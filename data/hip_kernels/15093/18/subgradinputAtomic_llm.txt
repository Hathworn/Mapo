```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform execution across threads
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Reorder loops to increase data locality within shared memory
// Prefetch data to reduce latency by overlapping computation with memory access
// Use float4 for vectorized memory loading where applicable
// Consider using cooperative groups for improved memory hierarchy utilization
