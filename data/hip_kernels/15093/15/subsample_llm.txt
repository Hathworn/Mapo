```
// Use shared memory to cache input data to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize summation within the kernel
// Evaluate using loop unrolling for kernel loops to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure no bank conflicts in shared memory access pattern
// Apply occupancy calculator to select optimal block size for performance
