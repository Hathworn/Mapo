```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when updating ptr_gradInput for better performance.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory to optimize memory throughput.
// Ensure optimal block and thread configuration to maximize GPU utilization.
// Investigate using the texture memory for constant data like weight to reduce memory latency.
// Check alignment of memory accesses to prevent unaligned access penalties.
