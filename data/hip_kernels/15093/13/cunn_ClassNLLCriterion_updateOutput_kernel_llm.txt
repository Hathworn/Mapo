// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory access and speed up data sharing between threads.
// Consider aligning data structures to memory access patterns to ensure optimal coalescing.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques for improved performance inside the nested loop.
// Evaluate if further reduction operations can be optimized using atomic operations for specific aggregation needs.
// Check if the conditional branches due to apply_weights can benefit from code organization or warp specialization.
