```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for faster access.
// Group threads accessing the same data to benefit from coalesced memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring that threads access contiguous elements in shared memory.
// Check for memory alignment to maximize bandwidth utilization.
