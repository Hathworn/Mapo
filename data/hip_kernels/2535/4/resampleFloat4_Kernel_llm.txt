```
// Use shared memory to store crop of input data for better memory access patterns
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider loop unrolling for operations within the inner bounds check to reduce instruction overhead
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditions or using predicated operations where possible
// Pre-fetch data to registers if repeatedly accessed within a loop or calculation
