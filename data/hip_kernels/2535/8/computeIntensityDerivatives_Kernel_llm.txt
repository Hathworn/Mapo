```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access patterns.
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
// Align data access to optimize coalesced memory access patterns.
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the number of variables in critical sections.
// Take advantage of asynchronous memory operations where possible.
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimal for avoiding bank conflicts.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to improve caching efficiency.
