``` 
// Use shared memory for scaling factors to optimize memory access
// Calculate scaling factors once per block to reduce redundant computation
// Synchronize threads after calculating shared memory variables
// Bounds check for output indices to avoid unnecessary computations
// Use unsigned integers for indices to avoid potential negative values
// Ensure all threads have completed updating and using shared memory
// Consider bank conflicts when using shared memory for better performance
