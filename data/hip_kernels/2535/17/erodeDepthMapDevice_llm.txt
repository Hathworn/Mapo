```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to d_input by ensuring threads within the warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate the potential benefit of using shared memory to store a tile of d_input.
// Each thread computes its own index based on block and thread indices only once, avoiding redundant calculations.
// Unroll the inner loop further to reduce loop overhead, consider pragma unroll to aid the compiler.
// Ensure data alignment for the d_input and d_output arrays to improve access efficiency and eliminate memory padding issues.
// Analyze the current occupancy and see if increasing the block size beyond 16x16 might improve throughput, based on register and shared memory usage.
