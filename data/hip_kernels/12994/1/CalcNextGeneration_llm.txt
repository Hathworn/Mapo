```
// Consider using shared memory for i_cells to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads for i_cells and o_cells
// Prefetch data to registers where possible to minimize latency
// Minimize divergence by restructuring branching logic
// Consider using loop unrolling in CountAliveCells function for performance gains
