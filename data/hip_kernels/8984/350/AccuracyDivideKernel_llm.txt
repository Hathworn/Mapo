```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for optimal throughput
// Minimize warp divergence by reducing branch instructions
// Implement shared memory buffering if needed for frequent accesses
// Align data structures to prevent uncoalesced memory accesses
// Opt for atomic operations if modifying accuracy in parallel contexts
// Consider asynchronous memory transfers to overlap I/O with computation
