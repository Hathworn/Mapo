// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Perform loop unrolling to minimize branch divergence
// Use warp-level reduction to optimize parallel aggregation
// Optimize memory coalescing by improving access patterns
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by balancing block size and grid size
// Prefer registers for temporary variables to reduce memory latency
// Adjust DP_BLOCKSIZE for architecture-specific performance tuning
