```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce global memory transactions
// Minimize warp divergence in the parallel reduction
// Ensure there are enough blocks to cover entire input array
// Try to use cooperative groups for better synchronizations
// Align shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
```
