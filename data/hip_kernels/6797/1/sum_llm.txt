// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for global memory loads to improve performance.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access by aligning shared memory data to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure proper synchronization after writing to shared memory.
// Balance the workload among threads to maximize utilization while minimizing idle threads.
// Investigate different block and grid sizes for optimal GPU occupancy and throughput.
