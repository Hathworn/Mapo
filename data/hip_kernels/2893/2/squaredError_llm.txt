```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Implement coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput and reduce memory latency
// Ensure memory is properly aligned to avoid unaligned memory accesses
// Use float2 or float4 data types where possible to increase memory bandwidth
// Experiment with block size to find the optimal configuration for the given hardware and problem size
