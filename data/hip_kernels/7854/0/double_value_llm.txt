```
// Ensure data is coalesced for memory access by aligning data structures
// Prefer using shared memory for frequently reused data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Minimize global memory accesses by indexing directly in calculations
// Consider memory padding to avoid bank conflicts if shared memory is implemented
// Utilize constant memory for any read-only data that all threads may use
// Use proper memory access patterns to enhance effective memory bandwidth utilization
