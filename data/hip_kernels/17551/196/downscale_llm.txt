```cpp
// Avoid branching by using ternary operators for bounds checking.
// Consider coalesced global memory access patterns for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data.
// Use shared memory to stage data for threads within the same block to reduce global memory access.
// Exploit loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Leverage vector data types for wider memory transactions if applicable.
// Utilize warp-level primitives to minimize synchronization requirements.
