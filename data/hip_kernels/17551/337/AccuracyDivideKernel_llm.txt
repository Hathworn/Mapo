```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to enhance data throughput.
// Evaluate if using a different execution configuration could lead to better occupancy and performance.
// Verify if the division operation can be optimized further, considering precision and performance trade-offs.
