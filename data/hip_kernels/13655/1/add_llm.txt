```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce memory accesses for better performance.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy.
// Consider using warp-unrolling for better parallel execution efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branching for better thread performance.
