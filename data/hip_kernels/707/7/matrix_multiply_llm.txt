```
// Consider using a larger TILE_WIDTH for better occupancy and performance
// Ensure __shared__ memory size does not exceed hardware limits for optimal performance
// Use __syncthreads() carefully to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Potentially use loop unrolling with #pragma unroll for improved performance
// Check if data alignment can be improved to reduce global memory access latency
