```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth efficiency
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Minimize branching within the kernel for better performance
// Try to minimize the use of atomic operations if not necessary
// Adjust block and grid sizes for optimal utilization of GPU resources
