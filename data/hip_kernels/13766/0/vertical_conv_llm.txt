```
// Use shared memory to cache kernel elements to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Align data structures for efficient memory access and avoid bank conflicts
// Consider adjusting block size based on the GPU architecture for optimal occupancy
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory access patterns for pixel data
