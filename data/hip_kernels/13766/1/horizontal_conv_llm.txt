```cpp
// Use shared memory for pixel blocks to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by processing pixels in rows
// Consider using float4 for reading/writing pixel data to reduce instructions
// Optimize padding function to reduce condition checks and branching
// Load all kernel values into shared memory to minimize repeated global reads
// Ensure all threads in a block are busy to improve warp efficiency
// Utilize loop unrolling to improve the computational throughput in convolution
