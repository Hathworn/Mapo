// Consider minimizing conditional checks inside kernels.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access when possible.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for performance.
// Evaluate thread block and grid dimensions for occupancy optimization.
// Avoid using atomic operations in performance-critical sections.
