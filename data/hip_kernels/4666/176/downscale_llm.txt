```
// Use shared memory to store gradOutput_data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider thread coarsening by assigning multiple iterations to each thread
// Unroll inner loops to maximize instruction throughput
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures
// Explore asynchronous memory operations to hide latency
```
