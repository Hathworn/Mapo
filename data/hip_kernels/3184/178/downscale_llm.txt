```
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for faster access within the block.
// Reduce the number of accesses to global memory by storing frequently used values in registers.
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data structures to reduce memory bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve parallel execution efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for gradOutput_data and gradInput_data to maximize throughput.
