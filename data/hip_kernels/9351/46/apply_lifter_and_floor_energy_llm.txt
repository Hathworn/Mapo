```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for lifter_coeffs and log_energy
// Coalesce global memory accesses by organizing data access patterns for features
// Consider loop unrolling in the while loop to decrease branch overhead
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize operations in the lifter coefficients application part
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal throughput
// Prioritize reading log_energy into a register for energy flooring condition check
