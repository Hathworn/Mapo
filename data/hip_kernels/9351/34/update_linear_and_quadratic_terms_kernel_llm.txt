```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Atomic operations are used to ensure safe updates across threads
// Prioritize coalesced memory access to optimize bandwidth
// Minimize divergence by aligning conditional checks across a warp
// Prefer use of registers for frequently accessed variables to reduce latency
