```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize warp divergence by controlling the conditional logic
// Consider loop unrolling for further performance improvements
// Perform alignment and coalescing for memory accesses to improve throughput
// Optimize use of conditional operations to minimize branch divergence
