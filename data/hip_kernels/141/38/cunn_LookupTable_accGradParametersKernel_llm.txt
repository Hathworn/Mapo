```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like gradOutputRow and weightRow
// Test the impact of different values of SZ on performance to find the optimal unroll factor
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning input and indices accesses
// Consider splitting block size and grid size to optimize resource usage based on hardware
