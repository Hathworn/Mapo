// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to reduce misaligned reads.
// Investigate the potential benefits of using shared memory for frequently accessed values.
// Examine whether loop unrolling could optimize performance for inner loops.
// Analyze the possibility of employing prefetching techniques for ptr_gradOutput and ptr_gradInput.
// Explore using __restrict__ keyword for gradInput and gradOutput pointers to enhance optimization.
// Optimize the computation of indices by minimizing arithmetic operations within the loops.
