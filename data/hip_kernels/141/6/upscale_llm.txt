```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by optimizing memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and load balancing
