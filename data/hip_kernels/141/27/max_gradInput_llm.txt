```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Use cooperative groups to synchronize threads more effectively and improve parallelism.
// Align memory accesses to benefit from memory coalescing for improved throughput.
// Evaluate the warp occupancy to ensure that all threads in a warp are utilized efficiently.
