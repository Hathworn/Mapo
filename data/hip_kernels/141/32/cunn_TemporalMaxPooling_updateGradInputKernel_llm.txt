// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for gradInput_data, gradOutput_data, and indices_data to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure all memory operations are aligned and avoid bank conflicts by optimizing thread access patterns.
// Optimize loading of indices_data into shared memory if possible to reduce global memory bandwidth consumption.
// Evaluate the usage of atomic operations and possible optimizations to minimize serialization overhead.
