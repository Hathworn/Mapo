```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed variables
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce control overhead and improve performance
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access patterns for better bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
// Ensure correct alignment of memory accesses to improve cache efficiency
