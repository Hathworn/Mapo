```
// Consider using shared memory more effectively for input data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by adjusting the access pattern of ptr_input and ptr_gradOutput.
// Evaluate using vectorized memory loads if memory alignment permits for faster data access.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() statements to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Balance the workload among threads more evenly to avoid idle threads during computation.
// Investigate the potential of loop unrolling beyond the pragma unroll for kx to enhance throughput.
