```c
// Consider aligning memory access to reduce cache misses.
// Use shared memory to store data that is reused within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to optimize data transformation across threads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking that threads read and write contiguous memory segments.
// Minimize use of atomic operations where possible as they can be a potential bottleneck.
