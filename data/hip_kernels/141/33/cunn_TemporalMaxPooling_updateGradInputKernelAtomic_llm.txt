```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for gradInput and gradOutput to improve memory access speed.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring that all threads within a warp take the same execution path.
// Perform memory prefetching to improve cache utilization where possible.
// Evaluate if using shared memory could enhance performance by reducing global memory accesses.
// Ensure indices array is accessed efficiently, potentially using texture or constant memory if applicable.
