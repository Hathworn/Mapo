```
// Consider coalesced memory access for gradOutput by iterating over contiguous memory.
// Use shared memory if data reuse is significant to reduce global memory access.
// Address potential bank conflicts in shared memory if implemented.
// Ensure memory alignment for float pointers to maximize memory throughput.
// Investigate if prefetching data can help reduce memory latency.
// Confirm that atomic operations do not become a bottleneck for performance.
// Explore using const restrict qualifiers to indicate non-aliasing pointers.
