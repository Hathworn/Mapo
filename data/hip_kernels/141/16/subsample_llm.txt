```
// Avoid recomputation of output size by caching values
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for faster access
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Use loop unrolling for the kH and kW loops to increase performance
// Ensure that input and output pointers are found at aligned memory addresses
// Implement strided memory access to reduce bank conflicts
