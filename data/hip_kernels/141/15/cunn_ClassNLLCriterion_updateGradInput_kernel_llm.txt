```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Minimize warp divergence by reducing conditional branching
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if applicable to aid compiler optimizations
// Consider loop unrolling for the ntarget loop to improve performance
```
