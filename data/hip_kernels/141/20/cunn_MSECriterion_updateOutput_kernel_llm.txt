```
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning input and target arrays
// Consider using float4 or float2 for input and target to improve memory efficiency
// Use cooperative groups for more efficient synchronization
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal shared memory utilization
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by optimizing the reduction algorithm
