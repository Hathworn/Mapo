// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance
// Minimize global memory access by fetching input values only once
// Use shared memory for partial sums to reduce global memory usage during reduction
// Ensure all threads contribute their partial sums before the reduction step
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing to improve bandwidth utilization
