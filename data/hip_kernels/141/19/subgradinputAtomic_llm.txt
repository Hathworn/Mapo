```
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated reads to the same elements
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads and writes
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit performance based on these loops
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned where possible
// Minimize divergent branches within the loops
