```
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and utilize GPU efficiently.
// Consider using read-only cache or texture memory for input matrices to improve memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring warp execution consistency.
// Unroll loops where possible to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Ensure memory alignment for coalesced memory transactions.
