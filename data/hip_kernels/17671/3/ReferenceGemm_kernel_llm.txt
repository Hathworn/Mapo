```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for matrices A and B
// Consider matrix blocking to optimize cache usage and reduce memory latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for matrices to improve bandwidth utilization
// Investigate using warp-level primitives to maximize throughput in the loop
