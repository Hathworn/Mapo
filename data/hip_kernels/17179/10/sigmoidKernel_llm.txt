```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced global memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses if possible.
// Ensure that the number of blocks and threads allows for full occupancy.
// Avoid branch divergence within warps for better performance.
// Consider using __expf() instead of expf() for potentially faster execution.
