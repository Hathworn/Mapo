```
// Use shared memory to cache parts of A and B matrices to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for loading data from global memory.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize parallel reductions for the variable 'inter'.
// Minimize the use of global memory by storing intermediate results in registers when possible.
// Ensure that memory access is aligned to avoid uncoalesced transactions.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources and minimize warp divergence.
