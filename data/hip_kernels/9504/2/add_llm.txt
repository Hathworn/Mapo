```
// Align data in memory for coalesced access to improve memory bandwidth
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Avoid divergent branches to maintain warp efficiency
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and load balancing
