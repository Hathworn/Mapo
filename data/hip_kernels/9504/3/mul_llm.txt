```
// Combine conditionals to reduce branching and improve warp execution efficiency.
// Unroll loops to reduce branch overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Utilize registers for temporary variables to reduce memory access latency.
// Ensure that memory access is coalesced where possible for improved memory throughput.
