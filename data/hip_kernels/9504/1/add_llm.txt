```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Minimize register usage by optimizing instruction scheduling
// Consider increasing the size of blocks to improve occupancy
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads if necessary
```
