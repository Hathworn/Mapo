```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by assigning consecutive threads to consecutive elements
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if applicable
// Optimize block and grid size for better occupancy
// Utilize hipMalloc for memory allocation on the GPU for better control
// Experiment with compiler flags for further optimization
