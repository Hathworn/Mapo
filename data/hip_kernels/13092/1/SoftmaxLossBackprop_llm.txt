```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize memory accesses by using registers where possible
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for repeated tasks
// Align data structures for coalesced memory access
// Reduce global memory access by consolidating atomic operations
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of the warp size
