```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring data is accessed contiguously
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize global memory latency
// Check for potential synchronization improvements within the block
// Ensure memory access patterns align with the hardware's capabilities
