// Consider using warp-level primitives for memory access to reduce bank conflicts.
// Try to leverage memory coalescing by organizing shared memory access patterns.
// Explore using __ldg() to optimize read-only memory accesses for global arrays.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can further improve performance for the kernel computation.
// Assess if compiler flags can be adjusted for better scheduling of instructions.
