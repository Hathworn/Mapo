```
// Optimize shared memory access patterns to coalesce global memory reads
// Use const memory when possible to reduce redundant reads
// Minimize bank conflicts by adjusting shared memory array layout
// Consider loop unrolling to increase register usage and reduce branch divergence
// Balance shared memory usage with register pressure for optimal performance
