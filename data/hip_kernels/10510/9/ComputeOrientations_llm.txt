```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for g_Data loading to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use loop unrolling techniques for the histogram initialization to minimize loop overhead.
// Improve data reusability by preferring shared memory for gauss and localized data storage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the kernel by minimizing divergent branches within loop constructs especially in histogram calculations.
// Apply warp-level primitives or cooperative thread arrays for efficient reduction operations.
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed data like i2sigma2 if it remains constant across kernels.
// Prefer templating or passing necessary constants through kernel arguments to avoid recalculating them within the kernel.
// Consider using the fast math library functions for mathematical operations like exp, sqrt, and atan2f to enhance performance.
// Experiment with different block sizes and numbers to find optimal occupancy and performance balance.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently, avoiding bank conflicts especially during histogram updates and reductions.
