```
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce latency.
// Coalesce memory accesses and improving iteration efficiency.
// Unroll loops to minimize instruction overhead.
// Ensure sufficient parallelism to fully utilize GPU resources.
// Align data structures to facilitate memory coalescing.
// Consolidate conditional statements to streamline execution.
