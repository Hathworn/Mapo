// Coalesced memory access for efficient global memory operations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Unroll loops to enhance performance through reduced branch divergence
// Minimize register usage to improve occupancy and parallelism
// Pre-load data into shared memory to prevent redundant global memory reads
// Avoid shared memory bank conflicts for better throughput
