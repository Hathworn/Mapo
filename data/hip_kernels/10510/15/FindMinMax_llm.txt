```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for d_Data by ensuring threads read contiguous elements.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring accesses to minvals and maxvals avoid conflict.
// Consider padding shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to ensure synchronization only when necessary.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to improve performance.
// Avoid using conditional statements inside loops where possible to reduce warp divergence.
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_xor_sync for more efficient reduction.
