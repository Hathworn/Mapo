```c
// Coalesced memory access for g_Data loading to reduce global memory transactions
// Use __builtin_assume_aligned for memory alignment hints, if applicable
// Consider loop unrolling for loading data into shared memory for improved performance
// Prefetch data to shared memory to hide memory latency
// Use warp-level primitives or shuffle for reductions to further optimize performance
// Consider preloading Gaussian values and access in a coalesced manner
// Optimize atomicAdd usage by redesigning memory access patterns or using parallel reduction
// Minimize __syncthreads usage or replace with warp-synchronous programming where possible
// Use float4 or other vector types for data loading to increase memory throughput
// Ensure proper use of __restrict__ keyword for pointers to aid compiler optimization
