```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory access efficiency
// Reduce divergent branches by consolidating boundary checks
// Consider using texture memory if data access patterns benefit from cached reads
// Ensure that data arrays are aligned to improve coalesced memory access
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Use loop unrolling if possible to minimize loop overhead
