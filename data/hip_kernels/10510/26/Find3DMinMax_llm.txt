// Optimize memory access by using shared memory caches effectively
// Minimize global memory access by reading input data into shared memory
// Ensure coalesced access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store intermediate min/max values for faster computation
// Reduce usage of __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead
// Consider overlapping computation and memory transfer if applicable
