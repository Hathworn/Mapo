```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using float2 or float4 loads for aligned data to reduce load instructions.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Try to reduce the __syncthreads() calls where possible to improve warp efficiency.
// Align data structures to match memory architecture for better performance.
