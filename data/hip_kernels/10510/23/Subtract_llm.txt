// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize divergent branches by handling boundary checks efficiently
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy
// Prefetch data to registers for reuse within loops to reduce memory latency
