```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by having threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse within a block
// Optimize access patterns to reduce global memory transactions
// Ensure that block size is a multiple of warp size for optimal performance
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure maximum resource utilization
```
