```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve performance
// Use shared memory to enable data reuse among threads
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to increase throughput
// Evaluate reducing the number of divergent threads within the warp
// Assess if using vectorized memory operations could be beneficial
// Check if loop unrolling can help in improving instruction throughput
