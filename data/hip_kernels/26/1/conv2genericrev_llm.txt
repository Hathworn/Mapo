```
// Utilize shared memory for caching input or kernel tiles if possible
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Unroll loops with constant bounds for improved efficiency
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by using padding if necessary
// Leverage warp-level primitives for additional reduction efficiency
```
