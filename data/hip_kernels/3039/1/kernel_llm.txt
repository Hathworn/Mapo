```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches in the code to enhance execution efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory if frequently accessed data shows temporal locality.
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and reduce warp divergence.
// Prefetch data into registers to hide global memory latency.
