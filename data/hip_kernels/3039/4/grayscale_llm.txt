```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced global memory loads and stores
// Experiment with different block sizes to find optimal configuration for memory bandwidth utilization
// Use constant memory for fixed coefficients to benefit from hardware caching
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning accesses properly
