```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access by threads.
// Use texture memory for read-only image data to improve cache hits.
// Explore loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead of repetitive operations.
// Ensure data alignment to take advantage of memory access throughput.
