```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data in a structure of arrays
// Consider using shared memory to cache data frequently accessed by multiple threads
// Reduce global memory accesses by organizing calculations to use registers whenever possible
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant reads from global memory
// Minimize the usage of atomic operations unless necessary to avoid serialization
