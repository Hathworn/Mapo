```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve read/write efficiency
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the hardware architecture
// Check the possibility of loop unrolling for better performance
// Evaluate the use of __ldg() for read-only data to take advantage of cache
