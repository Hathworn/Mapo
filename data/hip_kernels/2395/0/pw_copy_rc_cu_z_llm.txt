```
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Ensure memory alignment for double-precision operations.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Try asynchronous data transfer to overlap computation and communication.
