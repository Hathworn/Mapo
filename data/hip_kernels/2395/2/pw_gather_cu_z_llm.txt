```
// Consider using shared memory to cache ghatmap for better access speed
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for reading from c and writing to pwcc
// Minimize the calculations within the loop by pre-calculating repeated expressions
// Ensure alignment of pwcc and c for optimal memory transactions
// Evaluate the block and grid size for maximizing occupancy
