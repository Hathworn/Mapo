```
// Use shared memory to enhance data locality.
// Combine loads to reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory addresses.
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for better throughput.
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable for further performance boost.
