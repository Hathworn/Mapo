// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data like u, v, and src to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize divergent branches by avoiding redundant calculations inside loops.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only access to data such as src for improved cache efficiency.
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data and ensuring coalesced accesses.
// Use compile-time unrolling pragmas to reduce loop overhead and improve parallelization efficiency.
// Evaluate performance considerations of atomic operations and potential alternatives where applicable.
