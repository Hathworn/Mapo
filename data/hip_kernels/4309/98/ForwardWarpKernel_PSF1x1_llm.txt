```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory transactions.
// Pre-fetch values to register to reduce global memory reads.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Use atomic operations only when necessary to reduce contention overhead.
// Explore loop unrolling for performance improvement in intensive computations.
