// Consider unrolling the loop for loading data into shared memory to reduce branch divergence
// Use pointer arithmetic for accessing f_d to reduce index calculation overhead
// Utilize more shared memory to minimize global memory accesses during stream step
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory writes
// Ensure the shared memory usage is within limits to avoid bank conflicts
