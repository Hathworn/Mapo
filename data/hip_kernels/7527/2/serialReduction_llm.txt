```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for d_array to improve memory access
// Ensure d_array is aligned to improve coalesced memory access
// Use warp-level primitives to decrease synchronization overhead within block
// Consider reducing the number of atomic operations by using hierarchical reduction
// Optimize the occupancy to ensure maximum thread utilization
