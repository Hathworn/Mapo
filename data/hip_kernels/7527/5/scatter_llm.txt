```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring d_predicateArray, d_scanArray, and d_array are accessed in a sequential manner.
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory where possible for commonly accessed global memory.
// Use fewer conditional branches inside loops for improved warp execution efficiency.
// Minimize the number of arithmetic operations, such as d_scanArray[index] - 1 + offset.
// Ensure d_scatteredArray is aligned for optimal memory transaction efficiency.
