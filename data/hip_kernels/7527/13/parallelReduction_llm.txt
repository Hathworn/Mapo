```
// Load input data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads reach __syncthreads()
// Perform reduction using a stride loop for coalesced access
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring aligned access patterns
// Store intermediate results only once at the end of the reduction
