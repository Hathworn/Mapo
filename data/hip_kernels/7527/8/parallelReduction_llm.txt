```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase performance
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Optimize shared memory usage to maximize bandwidth and minimize bank conflicts
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are chosen efficiently to fully occupy the GPU
```
