```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Optimize for branch divergence by arranging conditional checks for warp efficiency
// Minimize global memory accesses by using register variables for intermediate computations
// Consider utilizing atomic operations if applicable to reduce thread contention for updates
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block and grid size for better utilization
