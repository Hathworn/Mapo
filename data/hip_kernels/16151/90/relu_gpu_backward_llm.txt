```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Unroll loops to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Align data to 128 bytes for coalesced memory access
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reduction tasks
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance
