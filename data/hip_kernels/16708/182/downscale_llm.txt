// Cache the gradOutput value to reduce global memory access
// Prefer shared memory or registers for temporary storage
// Reduce stride-based memory access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance
// Minimize writes to global memory by computing results in registers first
// Ensure memory coalescing of global memory accesses
