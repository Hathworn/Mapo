```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for labels and probabilities to improve memory access efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads for `maxProbs`.
// Evaluate if using texture memory could benefit the access pattern for `probs`.
// Experiencing bank conflicts in shared memory can be reduced by reorganizing data access patterns.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by aligning conditional statements execution paths across threads.
