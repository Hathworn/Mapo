```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory access for gradOutput_data
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to 128 bytes for optimal performance
// Consider loop unrolling if scale_factor is small and known at compile-time
// Use float4 for vectorized memory access if aligned
// Ensure gradInput_data is accessed coalescently
```
