```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns for threads
// Minimize memory access latency by using shared memory if repeated access to source data is necessary
// Consider memory alignment for better performance by ensuring data structures are aligned to 32-byte boundaries
// Utilize memory as efficiently as possible by minimizing global memory transactions
