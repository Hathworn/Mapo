```
// Use shared memory for caching src matrix elements to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing src array elements contiguously
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner assignment loop to reduce loop overhead
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy based on target matrix size
// Remove redundant calculations inside the loop by calculating srcY*srcWidth prior to the loop
