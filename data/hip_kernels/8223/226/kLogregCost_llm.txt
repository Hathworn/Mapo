```c
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory efficiency
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory where possible
// Pre-load frequently accessed data into local variables
// Consider using texture memory for the probs array to optimize read access
// Align memory accesses to 128-byte boundaries to take advantage of cache lines
