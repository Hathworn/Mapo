```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase access speed
// Optimize warp reduction to minimize execution divergence and shared memory bank conflicts
// Consider using cooperative groups for more efficient warp-level reductions
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Check occupancy and adjust block size accordingly for better performance
