```cpp
// Ensure the grid size is sufficient to allow full parallelization
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage if applicable
// Ensure accuracy pointer is properly aligned for coalesced memory access
// Use __syncthreads() if additional synchronization is needed
// Explore vectorized operations for potential performance boost
