// Optimize memory access by using shared memory if possible  
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth  
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel for better warp execution  
// Ensure that accesses are within bounds to prevent out-of-bounds errors  
// Investigate vectorization opportunities using HIP vector types  
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed fixed values  
// Evaluate register usage to determine if it can be reduced  
// Optimize the offset calculation to avoid redundant operations  
// Align data accesses to improve memory transaction efficiency  
// Explore using atomic operations if necessary for concurrent writes
