// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to minimize global memory accesses
// Consider using loop unrolling for improved performance in calculations
// Optimize thread synchronization to reduce warp divergence
// Verify that BLOCKSIZE efficiently utilizes the GPU architecture
