```cpp
// Exit early to avoid unnecessary computations on out-of-bounds threads
// Use shared memory if accessing data multiple times to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for improved performance
// Ensure that 'offset' and 'n' are chosen to maximize coalesced global memory access
```
