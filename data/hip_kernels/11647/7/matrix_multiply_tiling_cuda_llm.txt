```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading A and B into shared memory.
// Consider padding shared memory arrays (As, Bs) to prevent bank conflicts.
// Increase BLOCK_SIZE for improved occupancy, if hardware constraints allow.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations in shared memory.
// Optimize loop unrolling pragma to maximize memory throughput.
// Ensure alignment of the matrices in global memory for efficient access.
// Profile memory throughput and latency to identify further bottlenecks.
// Consider prefetching techniques for next sub-matrix loads.
// Evaluate using half-precision or mixed-precision for performance gain.
