```c
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing.
// Utilize __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Limit divergent code within warp by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if double buffering in shared memory might help reduce memory transfer bottlenecks.
// Analyze loop efficiency to minimize redundant calculations.
// Experiment with block size and grid size to enhance occupancy and balance resources.
