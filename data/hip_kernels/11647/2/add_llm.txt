```cpp
// Align input data to improve memory coalescing
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Consider using warp shuffle techniques for inter-thread communication
// Minimize divergent branches by using conditional operators appropriately
// Ensure proper memory access patterns to exploit memory throughput
```
