```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by combining operations
// Unroll loops if the loop count is known at compile-time
// Optimize occupancy by choosing appropriate block size
