```
// Use shared memory to store data for reducing global memory access
// Ensure coalesced access pattern when loading matrices into shared memory
// Use the __syncthreads() directive after loading into shared memory
// Unroll loops to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Minimize synchronization within warp to improve performance
// Increase register-level compute to lessen shared memory dependency
// Use Kahan summation algorithm to reduce numerical error in floating-point addition
