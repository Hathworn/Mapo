// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to cache repeated accesses for better performance.
// Minimize conditional branching within the kernel to reduce divergence.
// Arrange computations to maximize arithmetic intensity and use registers efficiently.
// Ensure proper memory alignment and padding to reduce access latency.
// Experiment with loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput.
