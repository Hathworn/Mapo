```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like xn and xcur
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns
// Optimize data reuse by minimizing redundant calculations inside the loop
// Utilize vectorized operations if the hardware supports it to improve throughput
// Adjust block and grid size to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency
```
