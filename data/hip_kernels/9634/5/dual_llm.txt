```cpp
// Use shared memory to store tiles of the input data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling to increase the pipeline efficiency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts through optimal data layout.
```
