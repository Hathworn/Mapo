```
// Consider coalescing memory access by aligning data structures
// Minimize global memory transactions by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to cache data if appropriate, reducing global memory access latency
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory access efficiency
// Explore loop unrolling to enhance memory throughput and reduce loop overheads
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory to improve performance
