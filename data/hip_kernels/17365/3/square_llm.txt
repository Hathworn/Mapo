```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring d_in and d_out are contiguous
// Consider aligning data to avoid misaligned memory access penalties
// Utilize shared memory to store partial results if necessary
// Ensure data is accessed in a sequential manner for optimal caching
// Minimize memory accesses by reusing loaded values as much as possible
// Examine reducing the global memory footprint if feasible
