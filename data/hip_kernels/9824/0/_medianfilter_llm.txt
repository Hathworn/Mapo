```
// Consider using faster memory access patterns to minimize DRAM latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to optimize performance.
// Verify the shared memory usage is within the available limits to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider unrolling loops for reduced loop control overhead or leveraging intrinsic functions.
