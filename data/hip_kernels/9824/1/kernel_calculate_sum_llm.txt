```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure all threads have finished updating shared memory before proceeding
// Optimize shared memory usage by initializing unused elements to zero
// Perform warp-level reductions for smaller block dimensions to increase efficiency
// Minimize global memory access by storing only necessary results back to global memory
