```
// Precompute index calculations to reduce repeated arithmetic operations
// Combine multiple accesses to global memory into fewer variable loads
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced where possible
// Optimize loop bounds checks to avoid redundant checks within the loop
// Fetch global memory values into registers early to allow reuse
// Minimize divergent branches by checking less frequently
// Consider using shared memory if applicable for repeated access to the same data
