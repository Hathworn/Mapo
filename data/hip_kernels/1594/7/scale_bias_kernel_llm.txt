```cpp
// Precompute global index to reduce redundant calculations
// Minimize the number of operations inside the critical section
// Use global index to streamline array access
// Focus on coalesced memory access patterns
// Consider optimizing memory usage with shared memory if necessary
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned for better performance
