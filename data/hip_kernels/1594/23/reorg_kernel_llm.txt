```
// Precompute expressions to minimize repeated calculations
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing
// Ensure indices are computed efficiently to reduce divergence
// Use shared memory if possible for repetitive calculations within a block
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for better throughput
// Strive to maximize the occupancy by choosing optimal block size
