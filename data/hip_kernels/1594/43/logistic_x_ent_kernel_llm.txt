```
// Consider coalescing memory access for better performance
// Use shared memory if there are common data accessed by multiple threads
// Eliminate bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Overlap memory transfers with computation using asynchronous copies
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp
// Avoid recalculating the index in each iteration
