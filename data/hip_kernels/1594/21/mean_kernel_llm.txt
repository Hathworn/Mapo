```
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize global memory reads.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant data fetching.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to improve cache performance.
// Evaluate unroll factor for loop unrolling to balance register usage and performance.
// Consider increasing block size to improve GPU utilization if resources allow.
