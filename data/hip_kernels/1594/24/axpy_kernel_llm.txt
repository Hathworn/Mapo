// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider aligning data on proper boundaries to take advantage of coalesced memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts.
// Ensure that data access is contiguous and aligned for better memory throughput.
