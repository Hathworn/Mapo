```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing.
// Ensure all threads have updated shared memory before performing the reduction.
// Use parallel reduction with stride to efficiently compute the sum.
// Perform the final write to global memory outside the for loop to minimize update operations.
