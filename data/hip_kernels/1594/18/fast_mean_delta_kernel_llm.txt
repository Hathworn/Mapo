```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Unroll inner loop to reduce loop overhead and improve efficiency
// Use block-level parallel reduction for better performance
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning index calculations properly
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after sharing partial sums
// Prefetch data to shared memory to minimize latency
// Consider loading multiple elements simultaneously if registers permit
