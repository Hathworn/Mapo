// Consider coalesced memory access for 'delta' by rearranging data layout
// Prefetch 'variance[i]' to register to reduce global memory access
// Unroll loops to improve performance by reducing loop control overhead
// Consider sharing data across threads within a warp to reduce redundant calculations
