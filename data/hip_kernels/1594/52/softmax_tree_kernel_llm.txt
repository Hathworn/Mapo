```
// Consider using cooperative groups for improved synchronization and memory access management.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead and increase warping efficiency.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing its allocation and maximizing data reusability.
// Consider employing loop unrolling within parallel reduction for the sum to enhance instruction throughput.
// Evaluate using atomic operations cautiously as they can limit the parallel capacity of the kernel.
// Investigate potential for occupancy improvements by adjusting block size and shared memory usage.
