// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for spatial data
// Prefetch data from global to shared memory for better coalesced access
// Minimize conditional operations for better warp execution efficiency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for both forward and backward cases
// Consider loop unrolling for potential performance improvement
// Align data allocations to improve memory access efficiency
