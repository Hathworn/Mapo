```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize thread usage by ensuring coalesced access to global memory for x, delta, and mean.
// Unroll the inner loops to improve instruction throughput and reduce loop overhead.
// Evaluate if loop interchange could benefit cache locality for delta[index] and x[index].
// Minimize divergence by aligning thread execution paths where possible.
// Check if using float2 or float4 data types could enhance memory throughput.
