```
// Consider using shared memory for mask to reduce global memory accesses
// Use warp-level primitives to ensure efficient execution within a warp
// Employ vectorized memory operations if possible for x and mask arrays
// Explore potential benefits of using texture memory for mask
// Implement loop unrolling if further performance enhancement is needed
