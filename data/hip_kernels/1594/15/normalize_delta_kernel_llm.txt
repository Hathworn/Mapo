```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed variables like mean and variance
// Consider using register variables for inv_sqrt_var and factor to reduce access time
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory access
// Check if using atomic operations can improve performance when updating shared variables
// Investigate loop unrolling for operations inside if-clause to reduce instruction overhead
