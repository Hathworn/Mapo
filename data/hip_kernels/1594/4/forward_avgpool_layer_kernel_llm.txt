```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure that shared memory is appropriately sized when launched
// Consider optimal block size for maximal occupancy and performance
// Utilize coalesced memory accesses when reading input
// Minimize divergent warps by ensuring uniform access patterns
// Perform in-block reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
