```
// Consider using a memory coalescing strategy to enhance global memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate if the loop over 'filters' can be unrolled for performance improvement.
// Investigate potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage and align access patterns to mitigate them.
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits to prevent kernel launch failures.
// Profile the code to ensure the use of shared memory leads to actual measurable performance gains.
