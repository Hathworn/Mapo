```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for pred and truth arrays to optimize throughput.
// Utilize __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if there are no overlapping data accesses to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Align data structures to natural boundaries to potentially improve memory access speed.
