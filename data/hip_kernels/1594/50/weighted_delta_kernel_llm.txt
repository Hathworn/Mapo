```c
// Cache frequently accessed global memory values to local variables to reduce memory access latency.
// Use if-checks to minimize branch divergence between threads.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Consider using shared memory if further caching is required for frequently accessed data.
