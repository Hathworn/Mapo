// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Utilize shared memory if there are common access patterns to reduce global memory bandwidth consumption
// Examine if using half-precision operations would be beneficial to improve performance
// Assess if reducing the scope of variables like "stride" can optimize register usage
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to prevent excessive bank conflicts on GCN architectures
