```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads for pred, truth, delta, and error arrays.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access and latency.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for further optimization on data reduction tasks.
// Evaluate if using vectorized loads and stores could improve performance on current GPU architecture.
// Profile to check if occupancy is maximized and ensure optimal block and grid size configuration.
