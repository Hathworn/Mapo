```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads/writes
// Ensure the grid-stride loop covers all elements for arbitrary N
// Consider using fewer threads if N is significantly smaller than total threads
// Avoid using bank-conflict-prone memory layouts in shared memory
