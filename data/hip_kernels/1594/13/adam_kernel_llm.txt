```
// Minimize global memory access by loading m[index] and v[index] once.
// Reduce redundant powf calculations by pre-calculating and reusing B1^t and B2^t.
// Utilize registers to store intermediate results to avoid repeated computation.
// Consider using shared memory if there is reuse of data between threads.
