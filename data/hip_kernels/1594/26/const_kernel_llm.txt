```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by using sequential indices
// Consider using shared memory for ALPHA if multiple threads use the same value
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring stride alignment with memory boundaries
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to improve compiler optimizations
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes for optimal performance
