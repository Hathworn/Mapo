```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for pred and truth to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate results where possible
// Consider reducing global memory accesses by using registers to store repeated accessed data
// Optimize block and grid sizes for maximum GPU occupancy
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to increase memory efficiency
// Minimize the use of divergent branches to maintain thread efficiency
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to optimize reductions or broadcasts
