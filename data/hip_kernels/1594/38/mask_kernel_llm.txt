```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Minimize divergent branches by reducing complexity of condition checks
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if no aliasing is intended
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory if reuse is expected
// Use warp shuffle instructions to optimize intra-warp communications
