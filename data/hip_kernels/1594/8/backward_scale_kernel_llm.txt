```
// Unroll the first loop for better performance
// Use __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Consider using float2 or float4 for coalesced memory access if applicable
// Ensure memory is accessed in a coalesced pattern within the loops
// Replace shared memory usage with warp shuffle instructions for reduction
// Use atomic operations judiciously as they can be costly; explore alternatives if feasible
// Align data structures to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
