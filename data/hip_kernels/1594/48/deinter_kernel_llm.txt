// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within blocks.
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning data correctly when using shared memory.
// Use loop unrolling where applicable to enhance instruction throughput.
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block size and registers used.
