// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced access by checking memory alignment
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for potential performance gain
// Assess the benefits of using more threads per block for better occupancy
// Minimize divergence by avoiding conditional statements within the loop
