```
// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring data is accessed in contiguous order
// Use shared memory to store block data to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to ensure maximum occupancy
// Prefetch data to registers where possible to reduce memory latency
// Use loop unrolling to minimize instructions and improve performance
