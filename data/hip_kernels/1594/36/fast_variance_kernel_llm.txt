```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory positions.
// Optimize the usage of shared memory by minimizing the usage when feasible, possibly by using warp-level primitives.
// Evaluate the appropriateness of using atomic operations for reduction if reducing at the global level is needed.
// Examine the impact of using float4 for loading elements if memory alignment allows for increased bandwidth efficiency.
// If appropriate, consider loop unrolling to improve the throughput of iterations over spatial and batch dimensions.
