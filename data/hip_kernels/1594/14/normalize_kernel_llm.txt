```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers x, mean, and variance to improve memory access
// Use shared memory to store mean and variance if they are accessed by multiple threads in the same block
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Explore using vectorized memory access to load multiple elements at once, for example using float4
