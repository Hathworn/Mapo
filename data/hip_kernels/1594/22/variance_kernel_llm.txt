// Use shared memory for variance to improve memory access performance  
// Initialize shared variance to zero for each thread  
// Move result from shared memory to global memory after calculation  
// Optimize memory access by minimizing the use of global memory within the kernel function  
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to improve performance
