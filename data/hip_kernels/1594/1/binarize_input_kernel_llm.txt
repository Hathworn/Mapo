```
// Consider increasing the block size for better occupancy and performance
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to minimize synchronization overhead
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes to global memory
// Preload data into shared memory in a coalesced manner to improve memory throughput
// Reduce branch divergence by minimizing conditional statements within loops
// Utilize vectorized memory operations if possible to enhance data throughput
