```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling to optimize the innermost loops.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from delta and writing to prev_delta.
// Consider using const memory for frequently accessed read-only data such as indexes. 
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by adjusting block dimensions appropriately.
