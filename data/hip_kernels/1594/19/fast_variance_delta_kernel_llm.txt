```cpp
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to reduce pointer aliasing and improve memory access efficiency.
// Optimize the memory access pattern by ensuring coalesced access for better performance.
// Utilize float4 or similar vector types to leverage memory bandwidth for loading/storing when appropriate.
// Consider increasing the block size if the number of spatial elements is large to enhance parallelism.
// Ensure that shared memory use is optimal and does not exceed hardware limits for efficient memory usage.
// Evaluate if unrolling the inner loops manually introduces performance benefits by reducing loop overhead.
