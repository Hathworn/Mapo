```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve data locality
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for both mat_in and mat_out
// Optimize block size and grid configuration to increase occupancy
// Consider padding shared memory arrays to prevent bank conflicts
// Utilize __syncthreads() efficiently to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory
```
