```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Prefer __restrict__ qualifier to aid compiler optimization
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to avoid penalties
// Consider using shared memory if further optimization is needed
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on your specific GPU architecture
```
