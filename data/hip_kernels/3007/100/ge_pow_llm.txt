// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access time
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring control structures are aligned with warp boundaries
// Prefer using registers for frequently accessed variables to reduce memory latency
// Consider loop unrolling for loops within the kernel to improve instruction throughput
// Use memory prefetching techniques to hide memory latency where applicable
