```
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize global memory transactions
// Ensure __restrict__ keyword is used for pointers if applicable
// Utilize shared memory to store values that are used repeatedly
// Experiment with loop unrolling if there are loops within kernels
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for the specific GPU architecture
// Prefetch data into registers where possible to reduce latency
