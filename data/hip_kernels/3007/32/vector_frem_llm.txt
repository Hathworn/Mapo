```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Align memory access patterns with warp size to minimize bank conflicts.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for efficient memory access.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Utilize vectorized data types when possible to improve memory access efficiency.
