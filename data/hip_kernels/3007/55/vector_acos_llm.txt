```
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to cache input data if reused by other threads in the block
// Consider memory alignment for input and output arrays for optimal performance
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration (e.g., block size) for better occupancy
// Minimize global memory transactions by using registers efficiently
// Attempt loop unrolling if applicable for the loop within the kernel
