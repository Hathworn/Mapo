```
// Consider using __restrict__ to help the compiler optimize memory access patterns.
// Ensure a and b arrays are allocated with proper memory alignment for faster access.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access overhead.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve throughput.
