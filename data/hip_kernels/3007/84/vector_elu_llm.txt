```
// Ensure memory coalescing for x and y to improve global memory access speed
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access common data to reduce global memory access
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce branch divergence and improve performance
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns and cache efficiency
