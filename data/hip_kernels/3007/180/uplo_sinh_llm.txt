// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve memory access performance.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Align data structures to prevent misaligned memory access and improve coalescing.
// Perform loop unrolling if applicable to minimize looping overhead.
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring threads within the same warp follow similar execution paths.
