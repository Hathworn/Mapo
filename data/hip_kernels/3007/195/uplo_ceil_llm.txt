```
// Use shared memory to cache data for reuse and reduce global memory accesses.
// Employ coalesced memory access patterns for better throughput.
// Minimize the divergence within warp execution by reducing conditional branches.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction throughput.
// Optimize memory access by aligning allocated memory to improve access speed.
