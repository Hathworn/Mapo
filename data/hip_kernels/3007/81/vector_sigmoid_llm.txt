```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input and output to improve bandwidth usage
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory alignment of input and output arrays
// Minimize divergent branches, check boundary conditions before kernel launch
// Consider prefetching data to registers to reduce latency
// Utilize shared memory if appropriate to reduce global memory access
