```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Consider using shared memory if there's reuse of 'a' values among threads.
// Ensure 'a' and 'b' arrays are aligned to avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if using texture memory can improve performance for read-only 'a'.
// Assess if prefetching data from global memory is beneficial.
