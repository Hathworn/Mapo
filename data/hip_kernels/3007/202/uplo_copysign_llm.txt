```
// Consider coalesced access for 'a', 'b', and 'c' by ensuring gid_0 maps to consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to cache parts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure that memory accesses for 'a', 'b', and 'c' are aligned to improve memory access efficiency
// Minimize the use of branching by restructuring the logic to reduce divergent warps
// Evaluate the usage of texture memory for read-only accesses to 'a' and 'b' for potentially better performance
