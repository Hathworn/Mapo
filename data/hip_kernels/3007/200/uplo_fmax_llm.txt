```
// Use shared memory to cache a and b values for coalesced access
// Ensure that ld_a, ld_b, and ld_c are multiples of warp size for bank conflict reduction
// Use loop unrolling for regular access patterns in fmax operation
// Leverage asynchronous memory copy operations to overlap memory transfer and computation
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to help compiler optimizations
