```
// Leverage shared memory to minimize frequent global memory writes
// Align memory access patterns for x and y arrays for optimal coalescing
// Consider optimizing stride to enhance memory access efficiency
// Assess the impact of warp divergence on performance and refactor if necessary
// Ensure the use of atomic operations is minimized within critical sections
