// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Explore memory coalescing by adjusting data layout for better performance.
// Use asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation and data transfer.
// Investigate vectorization of computations to enhance throughput.
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency.
