```
// Use coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses across threads
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure that input and output are aligned to improve cache performance
// Minimize stride for better memory access pattern and potential performance gain
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for additional optimization
// Implement prefetching if applicable to hide memory latency
```
