```
// Increase block size to improve occupancy and reduce scheduling overhead
// Use shared memory to cache data for repeated access
// Implement coalesced memory access for x and y arrays
// Use asynchronous data transfers to overlap computation and data movement
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize performance further
// Load multiple elements per thread to increase arithmetic intensity
