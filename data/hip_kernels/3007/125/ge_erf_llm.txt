// Use __restrict__ pointers to minimize aliasing effects on memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for both a and b arrays.
// Consider using shared memory if reusing elements of a within the same block.
// Optimize the memory stride by aligning memory accesses with warp boundaries.
// Evaluate using vectorized data types such as float2 for better memory throughput.
