// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Improve data coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Reduce divergent branches within the conditional boundary check.
// Ensure proper memory access pattern to utilize memory bandwidth effectively.
// Cache data in registers as much as possible to reduce memory latency.
