// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use const memory or shared memory if the constants are repeatedly accessed by threads
// Pre-calculate indices to minimize redundant arithmetic operations within the loop
// Align data structures to prevent bank conflicts and maximize memory throughput
