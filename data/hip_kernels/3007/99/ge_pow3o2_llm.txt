```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache a subset of global memory reads if data reuse allows
// Coalesce global memory accesses to a and b by ensuring gid_0 and gid_1 increment regularly
// Minimize divergent branching by reducing conditional checks and ensuring warp-wide execution paths
// Consider using half precision if precision requirements allow to enhance memory bandwidth usage
```
