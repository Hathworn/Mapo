// Coalesce memory access for global memory reads
// Ensure alignment of memory pointers to avoid non-coalesced access
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce redundant global memory reads
// Minimize divergent branching by structuring conditional blocks for uniform access
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
