```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure that 'a' and 'b' are aligned to a suitable boundary to maximize memory coalescing.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by appropriately padding the allocations if necessary.
