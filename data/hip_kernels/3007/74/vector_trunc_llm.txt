```
// Minimize memory access latency by ensuring data alignment
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Optimize the grid and block size configuration to maximize occupancy
// Consider asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap computation and data transfer
