```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to aid compiler optimization by indicating no aliasing
// Avoid warp divergences by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path
// Replace division with multiplication by reciprocal to reduce computation overhead
// Aim for coalesced memory access by ensuring adjacent threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize bank conflicts by adjusting thread block size and memory layout if needed
// Inline small functions to reduce function call overhead
