```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for reading from array 'a' to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory efficiently by limiting its size and maximizing reuse
// Employ warp divergence minimization techniques via thread synchronization
// Ensure synchronization points are necessary to avoid performance bottlenecks
// Explore occupancy enhancements by adjusting block size and using __launch_bounds__ if applicable
