// Consider using shared memory for common data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize data alignment and access patterns for better caching
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the arrays a and b to enhance memory throughput
// Evaluate using warp-level primitives to minimize divergence and maximize efficiency
