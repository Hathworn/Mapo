```
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize global memory throughput
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for both reading from 'a' and writing to 'b'
// Explore using shared memory if there are redundant accesses to the same data
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions align with the data layout for optimal utilization
