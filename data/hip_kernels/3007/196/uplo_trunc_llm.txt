```c
// Use shared memory to cache elements of 'a' for coalesced reads and reduce global memory accesses.
// Employ vectorized types like float2 or float4 for loading and storing data to enhance memory throughput.
// Consider using a loop unrolling technique for any potential loops inside the kernel to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Opt for __syncthreads() only if necessary after loading data into shared memory to prevent unnecessary overhead.
// Align memory accesses to facilitate coalesced memory accesses and optimize performance.
