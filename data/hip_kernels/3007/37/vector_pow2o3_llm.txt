```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring stride is divisible by warp size
// Use vectorized data types like float2 or float4 for better memory throughput
// Minimize the use of pow function by using simpler arithmetic if possible
// Implement loop unrolling if multiple operations are performed per thread
