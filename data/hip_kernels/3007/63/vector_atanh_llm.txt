```
// Ensure data is coalesced by optimizing memory access patterns for x and y
// Use shared memory to store data blocks if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider adjusting grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Use memory prefetching instructions to hide memory latency if supported
