```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to optimize data exchange within threads.
// Use read-only cache for input data that is not modified by the kernel.
// Evaluate the benefit of using constant memory for small frequently accessed data.
