// Consider coalesced memory access for 'a' and 'b' to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory access is aligned to improve access speed.
// Avoid branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements.
// Optimize block and grid size for better GPU occupancy and efficiency.
