```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring global memory accesses are aligned.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access when multiple threads access the same data.
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions to better match the workload distribution.
// Try using appropriate prefetching techniques to hide global memory latency.
// Consider loop unrolling if there are any iterative operations within each thread's work.
// Check if using texture memory benefits read-only data access patterns.
