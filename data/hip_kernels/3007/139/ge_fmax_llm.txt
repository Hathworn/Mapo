// Consider coalescing memory accesses for `a`, `b`, and `c` to improve performance.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if possible.
// Optimize the thread block size based on the GPU architecture to maximize occupancy.
// Avoid branching by reorganizing data to minimize conditional statements.
