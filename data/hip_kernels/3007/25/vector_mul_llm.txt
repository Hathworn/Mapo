```
// Consider using shared memory for repeated data access to reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data in x, y, and z arrays.
// Minimize stride lengths or ensure they're set to access pattern-friendly values.
// Unroll loops if the multiplication can benefit from repeated execution efficiency.
