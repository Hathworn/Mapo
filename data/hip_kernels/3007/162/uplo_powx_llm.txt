```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses for a and c
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated operations within conditional checks
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
