// Consider coalescing memory accesses for x and y arrays for better memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads are accessing the same elements of x and y.
// Try to align data accesses to improve bandwidth usage on modern hardware.
// Ensure datatype alignment; for example, use float4 if possible for vectorized memory access.
