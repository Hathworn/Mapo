```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with contiguous data in memory
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access overhead
// Optimize the memory access pattern for better cache utilization
// Use a vectorized data type for loading/storing multiple elements at a time, if possible
