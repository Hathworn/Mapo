```
// Precompute indices to minimize arithmetic calculations in the loop.
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve performance.
