// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use "const restrict" qualifiers if aliasing is not an issue for improved compiler optimization.
// Consider using shared memory if the same data is reused within the block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory transaction efficiency.
