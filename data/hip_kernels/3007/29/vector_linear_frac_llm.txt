// Optimize memory access by ensuring aligned data access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to exploit instruction-level parallelism
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access common data; consider its impact
// Evaluate coalesced memory access to minimize global memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure the use of __restrict__ is consistent to aid compiler optimizations
