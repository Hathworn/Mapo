// Use __restrict__ pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Prefetch data into shared memory where possible to optimize memory access.
// Align memory accesses to improve cache efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branches for improved execution efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance where applicable.
