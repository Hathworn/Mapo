// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced by using proper strides.
// Minimize the stride size to maintain memory coalescing in global accesses.
// Utilize __restrict__ to help the compiler with optimization by indicating no aliasing.
// Apply boundary check early to prevent unnecessary calculations.
