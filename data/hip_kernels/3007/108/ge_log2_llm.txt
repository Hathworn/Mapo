```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve performance
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory operations
// Optimize grid and block dimensions according to the hardware capabilities
