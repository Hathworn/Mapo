```
// Use __restrict__ to help the compiler optimize memory accesses by indicating no aliasing.
// Ensure proper alignment of memory accesses by using aligned data structures where possible.
// Utilize shared memory if there are any reusable data across threads to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
