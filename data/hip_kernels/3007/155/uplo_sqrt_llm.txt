```
// Use __restrict__ keyword to inform the compiler that the pointers do not alias and optimize memory access.
// Check valid indices directly with logical AND to reduce unnecessary checks.
// Combine check conditions to simplify control flow and reduce branching.
// Simplified condition check improves performance by reducing the number of instructions.
// Inline mathematical operations where possible to reduce function call overhead.
// Use native functions like sqrtf to ensure optimal performance on the specific data type.
