```
// Use shared memory to cache data if the input array is accessed multiple times
// Employ coalesced memory access patterns for both reading and writing
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the hardware
// Consider aligning data for optimal memory access
// Minimize memory traffic by reducing global memory accesses within the kernel
// Check if using fewer registers per thread allows more threads to run concurrently
