// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced access by aligning data structures in memory
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize branching in warp execution by reducing the complexity of conditional statements
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum GPU occupancy
