// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations in global memory.  
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointer parameters to enable additional compiler optimizations.  
// Ensure proper alignment of memory allocations for improved memory access performance.  
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if necessary.  
// Evaluate the potential benefits of loop unrolling for small kernels.  
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming techniques if applicable for your use case.  
// Experiment with different block sizes to achieve optimal occupancy and performance.  
// Profile the kernel to identify bottlenecks and experiment with solving them.
