// Use __restrict__ to indicate no aliasing for memory access optimization
// Optimize memory access by minimizing stride in array indexing
// Prefer memory coalescing by adjusting thread and block dimensions accordingly
// Consider shared memory usage for improved access times if applicable
// Use loop unrolling if copying large blocks of data for reduced overhead
