```
// Consider coalescing memory access for x by ensuring stride_x is 1
// Ensure memory access for y is coalesced by setting stride_y to 1
// Minimize register usage inside the kernel by limiting variables
// Use __restrict__ keyword for x and y pointers to improve memory access efficiency
// Launch kernel with appropriate block size to maximize occupancy
// Explore using shared memory if there are common sub-expressions among threads
