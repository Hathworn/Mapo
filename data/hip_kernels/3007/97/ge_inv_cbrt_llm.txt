```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to improve compiler optimizations.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for improved performance.
// Consider using vectorized data types like float4 if applicable.
// Minimize bank conflicts if shared memory is utilized.
// Align memory accesses to avoid performance penalties.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to enhance ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Check if occupancy can be improved by optimizing resource usage.
