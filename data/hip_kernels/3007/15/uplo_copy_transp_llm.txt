```cpp
// Consider increasing tile size for better memory coalescing if shared memory allows
// Ensure shared memory usage doesn't exceed available SM resources
// Check alignment of memory accesses to reduce potential bank conflicts
// Use appropriate occupancy tool to find optimal block size for target hardware
// Investigate if loop unrolling could further improve performance
// Consider non-default memory access patterns to exploit L1/L2 cache
