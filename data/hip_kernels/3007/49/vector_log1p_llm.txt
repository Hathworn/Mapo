```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block
// Evaluate if using texture memory could enhance performance for read-only data
// Potentially employ loop unrolling for improved performance in the main loop
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to better match the hardware capabilities
