```
// Minimize divergent code by ensuring gid_0 and gid_1 calculations are consistent across the warp.
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data structures to coalesce memory accesses.
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring proper access patterns in shared or global memory.
// Leverage shared memory for frequently accessed data if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
