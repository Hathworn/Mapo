```cpp
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Evaluate potential benefits of using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Check if using textures or read-only cache can improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Analyze the balance between computation and memory access to hide latency effectively.
// Ensure appropriate occupancy to fully utilize available GPU resources.
