// Consider using shared memory to cache parts of array a for faster access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses to word boundaries for a and b.
// Group threads to minimize warp divergence by optimizing conditional checks in control structures.
// Implement loop unrolling for computation of lgamma to reduce instruction overhead.
