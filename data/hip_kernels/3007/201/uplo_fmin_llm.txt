```
// Use __restrict__ to maximize compiler optimization opportunities
// Combine multiple conditions into one to reduce branching
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Avoid redundant calculations by computing once and reusing the result
// Use inline functions to reduce function call overhead
