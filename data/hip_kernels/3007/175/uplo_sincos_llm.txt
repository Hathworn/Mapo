```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking the memory layout of arrays
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data to shared memory to hide global memory access latency
// Minimize condition checks inside the kernel to improve performance
// Align data structures in memory to optimize access patterns
