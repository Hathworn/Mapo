```
// Combine loads and stores by using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Align data structures to improve memory coalescing
// Utilize vectorized operations if possible for better throughput
// Prefer reading consecutive memory locations by threads in a warp
// Minimize divergent code execution between threads in a warp
// Adjust block and grid size to fit hardware for optimal occupancy
