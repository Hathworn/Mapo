// Consider coalesced memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread block size and grid size for improved occupancy and efficiency
// Ensure memory alignment for both input and output arrays
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores to optimize memory transactions
