```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data layout
// Minimize divergence by structuring condition checks sequentially
// Use shared memory if appropriate for repetitive data access
// Consider loop unrolling if processing large arrays
// Reduce arithmetic complexity inside conditional blocks
```
