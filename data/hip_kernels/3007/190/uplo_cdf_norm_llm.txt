```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to a and b for better memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to store tiles of a for reuse and reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize the branch condition by reorganizing the condition or using loop unrolling if applicable
// Ensure that the block and grid sizes are chosen to maximize occupancy on the GPU
