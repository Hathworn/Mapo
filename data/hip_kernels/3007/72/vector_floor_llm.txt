```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache data from global memory
// Coalesce memory accesses for x and y to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling for faster execution
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Align data to 16-byte boundaries for efficient memory access
