```
// Use shared memory to store reused data, reducing global memory access.
// Consider coalescing memory access for 'a', 'b', and 'c' arrays to improve access patterns.
// Ensure alignment of data pointers to optimal boundaries to improve memory access speed.
// Prefetch data for 'a' and 'b' into registers to minimize latency.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure that the kernel launch parameters are tuned for the best occupancy and performance.
