// Consider using shared memory for data coalescing to improve memory access patterns.
// Utilize registers to store frequently accessed data to minimize repeated calculations.
// Synchronize threads to ensure data is fully loaded into shared memory before computation.
// Ensure condition checks for data operations are minimized within the loop to enhance performance.
// Consider using shared memory only when the block size allows efficient use.
