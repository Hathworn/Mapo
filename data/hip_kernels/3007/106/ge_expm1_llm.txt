```cpp
// Use __restrict__ to help the compiler optimize memory access as much as possible.
// Ensure data is coalesced by aligning memory access to warp boundaries.
// Minimize conditional statements within the kernel as much as possible for performance.
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size or grid size for optimization.
