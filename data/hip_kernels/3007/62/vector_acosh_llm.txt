```
// Use shared memory for faster data access
// Load element into shared memory before computation to reduce global memory access
// Ensure all threads have loaded their element using __syncthreads() to maintain consistency
// Perform computation on data stored in shared memory
// Use shared memory to minimize latency associated with global memory access
