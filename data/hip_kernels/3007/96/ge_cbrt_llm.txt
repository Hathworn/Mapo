```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure data in shared memory is coalesced for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use __syncthreads to ensure all threads have completed copying to shared memory before use.
// Use local thread indices to access shared memory efficiently.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on shared memory size constraints.
