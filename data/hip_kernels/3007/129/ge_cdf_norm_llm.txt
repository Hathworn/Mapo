```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for both reads and writes.
// Minimize thread divergence by structuring branching conditions appropriately.
// Use vectorized operations if the hardware supports it, e.g., processing multiple elements per thread.
// Consider using loop unrolling techniques where applicable to minimize loop overhead.
// Try to avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
