// Consider using shared memory to cache data from global memory for better access speed
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use vectorized loads and stores where possible to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Try tuning block and grid size to achieve better occupancy and performance balance
