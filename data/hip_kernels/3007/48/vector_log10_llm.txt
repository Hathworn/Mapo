```
// Consider using shared memory for values that are frequently used across multiple threads.
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring that memory accesses are contiguous.
// Optimize stride access patterns to reduce divergent memory access.
// Utilize register variables for computation to minimize global memory access.
// Evaluate if offset calculations can be reduced for better performance.
