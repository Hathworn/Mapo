```
// Use __restrict__ keyword to aid the compiler in optimizing memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in memory
// Consider using shared memory if there are shared computation patterns
// Minimize use of global memory where possible to reduce memory latency
// Utilize warp-level primitives to reduce redundant calculations
