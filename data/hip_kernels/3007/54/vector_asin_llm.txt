// Consider using shared memory for repetitive access patterns to reduce global memory traffic.  
// Ensure proper memory alignment for coalesced access to improve memory access efficiency.  
// Evaluate potential thread divergence, as mathematical functions like asin could lead to non-uniform execution paths.   
// Implement asynchronous data transfer techniques to hide memory latency from host to device.
