```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by having threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Unroll loops if applicable to increase instruction throughput.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if applicable to discourage unnecessary aliasing.
// Evaluate whether texture memory could be beneficial for read-only data like 'a'.
