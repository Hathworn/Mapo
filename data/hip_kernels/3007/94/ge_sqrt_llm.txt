// Use __restrict__ pointers to ensure compiler optimizes memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Align data access to avoid potential bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse and minimize global memory accesses
// Evaluate occupancy and optimize block and grid dimensions for maximum throughput
