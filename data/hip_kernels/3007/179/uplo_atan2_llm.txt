```cpp
// Align memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses
// Use shared memory to cache a and b values to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider employing loop unrolling if loops are present for better instruction throughput
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions maximize the occupancy for given GPU configuration
// Check if using __restrict__ keyword can aid in improving memory access efficiency
