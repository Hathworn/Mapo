// Use shared memory to cache a row or column of input data for coalesced access
// Consider using memory coalescing techniques for both read and write operations
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by using padding if necessary
// Ensure alignment of data structures to maximize memory access efficiency
// Explore possible thread-block size configurations for hardware occupancy optimization
