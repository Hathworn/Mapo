```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning memory with warp boundaries.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data locality.
// Optimize memory alignment for better performance on GPU architecture.
// Ensure that memory strides align with application-specific data patterns.
// Explore using texture or constant memory for read-only data.
