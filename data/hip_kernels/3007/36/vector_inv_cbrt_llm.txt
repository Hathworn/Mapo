```c
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory utilization.
// Minimize memory access latency by using shared memory if applicable.
// Evaluate the need for prefetching data to reduce memory latency.
// Align data structures to improve the efficiency of memory transactions.
// Consider data padding if memory access patterns are not optimized.
