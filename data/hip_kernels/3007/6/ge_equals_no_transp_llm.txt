```
// Consider using shared memory for better data locality if memory access pattern allows.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning gid_0 and gid_1 to row-major or column-major order.
// Minimize divergent branches by revising condition checks for best warp execution.
// Balance the workload among threads to prevent idle threads due to boundary conditions.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for enhancing instruction-level parallelism.
// Use the __restrict__ qualifier if possible to inform the compiler about non-overlapping data.
