```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access patterns and reduce global memory latency
// Coalesce global memory access for the arrays 'a', 'b', and 'c' to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores if data alignment permits
// Ensure that memory access is aligned to avoid performance penalties
// Minimize divergent branches within warps for optimal parallel execution
