```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory
// Prefer to access memory in a sequential manner for better cache utilization
// Minimize the use of conditional statements inside the kernel
// Consider increasing the thread block size to improve occupancy
// Avoid overuse of multiple pointers that lead to non-coalesced access patterns
