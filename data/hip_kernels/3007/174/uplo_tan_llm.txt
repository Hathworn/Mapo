```
// Use __restrict__ to ensure no aliasing and enable better memory optimization.
// Inline the tangent operation to reduce the function call overhead if applicable.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data with warp boundaries.
// Consider using shared memory if there are multiple accesses to the same data.
// Ensure optimal block and grid dimensions for full GPU occupancy.
