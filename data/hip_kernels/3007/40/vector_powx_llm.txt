```
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'x' and 'y' arrays by adjusting strides and offsets appropriately.
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory if the data can be reused within the block.
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of `FAST_MATH` for accelerated math calculations if precision can be relaxed.
