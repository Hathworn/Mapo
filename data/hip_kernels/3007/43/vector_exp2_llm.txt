```
// Consider coalescing memory access by aligning data access patterns
// Use shared memory to optimize memory bandwidth utilization if applicable
// Reduce global memory access by preloading data into shared memory
// Ensure stride access does not lead to inefficient memory access patterns
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
