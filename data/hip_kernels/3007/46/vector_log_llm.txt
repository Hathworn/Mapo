// Optimization: Consider coalescing global memory accesses for x and y
// Optimization: Ensure shared memory size is appropriately configured in kernel launch
// Optimization: Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Optimization: Use vectorized data types like float2 or float4 for improved memory efficiency
// Optimization: Prefetch data to shared memory for subsequent thread block usage where possible
