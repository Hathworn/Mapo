```
// Consider coalesced memory access by accessing memory in contiguous blocks to enhance memory bandwidth.
// Optimize for shared memory usage if data reuse can be facilitated within blocks to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure memory alignment for improved data transfer rates.
// Evaluate loop unrolling for repetitive patterns to minimize loop overhead and maximize instruction throughput.
// Minimize conditional checks within tightly looped operations to reduce divergence and instruction stalls.
