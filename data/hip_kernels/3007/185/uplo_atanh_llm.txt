```
// Use shared memory to optimize data reuse within a block
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Reduce divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Align data accesses with cache lines to reduce cache misses
// Minimize the use of expensive library functions within the kernel
