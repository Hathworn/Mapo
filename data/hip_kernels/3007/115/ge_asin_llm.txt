```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for coalesced access.
// Check if the memory access patterns can be optimized for better coalescing.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied to increase throughput.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if they don't alias to improve compiler optimizations.
