```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous memory access pattern in global memory.
// Use shared memory if possible to minimize global memory access time.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
// Ensure that the threads are working within a contiguous range to improve cache utilization.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to indicate that pointers do not alias for further optimization.
