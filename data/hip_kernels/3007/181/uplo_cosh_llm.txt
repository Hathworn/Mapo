```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory access
// Minimize branching within the kernel to enhance performance
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve efficiency
// Consider using loop unrolling if applicable within kernel bounds to reduce loop overhead
