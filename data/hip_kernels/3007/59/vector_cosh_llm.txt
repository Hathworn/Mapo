```cpp
// Use coalesced memory accesses for optimal performance
// Avoid conditional statements within the kernel for better warp efficiency
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used if shared memory is introduced in future optimizations
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate computations if applicable
```
