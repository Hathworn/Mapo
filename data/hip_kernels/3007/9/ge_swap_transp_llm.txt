```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to improve cache locality for matrix elements.
// Ensure coalesced accesses for global memory reads and writes.
// Use warp shuffle operations if applicable for performance improvements.
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction throughput.
// Align data access to reduce memory transaction overhead.
