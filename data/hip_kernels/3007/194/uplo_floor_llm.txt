```
// Use cooperative thread scheduling to improve occupancy and reduce stalls
// Opt for shared memory caching for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access
// Align memory allocations to ensure coalesced memory accesses
// Optimize block size to maximize GPU resource utilization and minimize latency
// Employ loop unrolling for the repetitive computation when applicable
// Consider adjusting thread organization to better exploit locality in data access patterns
