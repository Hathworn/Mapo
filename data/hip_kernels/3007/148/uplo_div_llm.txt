```
//Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing.
//Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput.
//Minimize divergence by organizing the code structure for branching conditions.
//Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to maximize throughput.
//Perform bank conflict analysis on shared memory usage and adjust as necessary.
