// Consider memory coalescing to improve access patterns
// Evaluate using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Align data structures for better memory access alignment
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to reduce instruction overhead
