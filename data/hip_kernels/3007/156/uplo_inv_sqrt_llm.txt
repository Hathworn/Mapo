```
// Use shared memory to store thread-specific index calculations for improved memory access efficiency
// Precompute and store any constant values or repeated calculations to reduce unnecessary computation
// Consider aligning memory accesses to ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Investigate if memory padding or adjustment could improve performance on specific architectures
// Ensure that the computation of inverse square root is only executed when absolutely necessary
