```
// Combine the grid index computations to reduce repetitive operations
// Use bool data type to minimize branching costs
// Pre-compute indices outside conditional blocks to improve efficiency
// Reduce condition complexity by calculating the product once
// Minimize expensive CAST operations by employing constexpr if applicable
// Consider using shared memory for repeated data accesses
