```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Ensure data is arranged or accessed in a contiguous manner
// Evaluate shared memory usage to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize the use of registers to store frequently accessed data
// Analyze block and thread dimensions for maximizing occupancy
// Investigate utilizing loop unrolling for repetitive operations
// Assess usage of launch bounds to limit maximum block size
