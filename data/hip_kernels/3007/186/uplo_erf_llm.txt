```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning the data access patterns
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider pre-fetching data to registers to improve performance
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Avoid unnecessary recomputation by storing reused values in registers
