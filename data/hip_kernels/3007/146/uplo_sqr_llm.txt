```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency.
// Minimize divergent branching for threads in the same warp.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned for optimal performance.
// Evaluate the benefit of loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.
// Confirm that the block and grid dimensions are optimized for the target architecture.
// Verify memory access patterns to ensure they make use of caches effectively.
