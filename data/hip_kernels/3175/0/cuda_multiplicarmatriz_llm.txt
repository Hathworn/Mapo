```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing when loading data into shared memory
// Unroll loops where possible for enhanced parallelism
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Adjust block size based on GPU architecture for optimal occupancy
// Perform computations using registers to reduce latency
