```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for max and var arrays.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure that tam_imag is a multiple of the number of threads per block for optimal occupancy.
// Implement loop unrolling for the idx calculation to minimize overhead.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data access.
