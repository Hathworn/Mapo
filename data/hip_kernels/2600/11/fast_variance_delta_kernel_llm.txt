```
// Consider unrolling loops to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads from global memory
// Use shared memory effectively by loading data in chunks
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction instead of __syncthreads
// Ensure that warp divergence is minimized
// Consider aligning data structures for better memory access patterns
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters if applicable
```
