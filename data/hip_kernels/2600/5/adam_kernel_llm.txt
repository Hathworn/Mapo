```
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction throughput.
// Align memory access to ensure coalesced global memory transactions.
// Use __restrict__ keyword to indicate no aliasing and improve compiler optimizations.
// Pre-fetch data into registers to reduce latency in computations.
