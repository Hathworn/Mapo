// Consider using shared memory for 'temp_sum' to reduce global memory access.  
// Optimize memory access by using coalesced reads when accessing 'x'.  
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.  
// Ensure the number of threads per block is a multiple of warp size for better efficiency.
