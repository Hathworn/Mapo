```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring INCX is 1 for better memory performance
// Minimize redundant calculations and load operations in the kernel
// Prefer using shared memory if performing more complex operations within the kernel
// Ensure grid and block sizes are optimized for the GPU architecture
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to allow the compiler to optimize memory access
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations if data races are present
