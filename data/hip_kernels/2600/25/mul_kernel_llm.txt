// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by properly aligning X and Y arrays
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize loop to minimize latency overhead by maximizing arithmetic instructions
// Evaluate warp efficiency and adjust the block size for maximum occupancy
// Minimize control divergence by ensuring uniform branch execution across threads
