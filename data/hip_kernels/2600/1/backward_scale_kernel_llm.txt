// Unroll the inner loop to enhance memory coalescing
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement warp-level reduction to minimize atomic operations
// Optimize memory access by ensuring aligned memory reads
// Consider using cooperative groups for better warp synchronization
