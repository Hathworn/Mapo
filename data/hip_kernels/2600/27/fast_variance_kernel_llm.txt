```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning threadIdx.x with data structure in memory
// Utilize __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronization
// Optimize loop unrolling manually or using compiler flags for better parallelism
// Inspect shared memory usage to ensure no bank conflicts occur
// Merge final reduction of local sums more efficiently by using parallel reduction techniques
// Ensure proper memory alignment for arrays to take advantage of faster memory transactions
