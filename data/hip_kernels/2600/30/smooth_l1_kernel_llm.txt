```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for pred, truth, delta, and error to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure pred, truth, delta, and error are aligned to 32 or 64-byte boundaries for better memory access patterns.
// Optimize the calculation by minimizing the use of branch instructions within the conditional statement.
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access the same value to reduce global memory access.
// Experiment with different block sizes and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads.
