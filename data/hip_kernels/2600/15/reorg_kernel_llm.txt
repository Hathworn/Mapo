```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to maximize it.
// Utilize vectorized data types like float4 to improve memory throughput.
