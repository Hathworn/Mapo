```
// Consider using shared memory for storing frequently accessed data
// Coalesce memory accesses for arrays a, b, s, and c to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure data structures are aligned to memory boundaries for optimal performance
// Minimize divergent branches caused by the conditional b element retrieval
