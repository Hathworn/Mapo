```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring X and Y are accessed with consecutive indices.
// Use shared memory to cache data that is accessed multiple times by threads in a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure the grid and block sizes are optimized to fully occupy the GPU and maximize parallelism.
// Minimize the number of divergent branches to ensure warp execution efficiency.
