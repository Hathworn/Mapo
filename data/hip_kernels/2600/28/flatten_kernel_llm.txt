```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses.
// Ensure that 'N' is a multiple of the block size for full occupancy.
// Minimize divergent branches, especially within the kernel's critical path.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to best fit the GPU's multiprocessor count.
// Consider using loop unrolling for operations performed within the warp.
// Use `__syncthreads()` only if absolutely necessary, as it can cause performance bottlenecks.
