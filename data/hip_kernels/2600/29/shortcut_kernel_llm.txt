// Ensure data is aligned for coalesced memory accesses
// Consider using shared memory for repeated accesses to the same data
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and memory throughput
// Use float4 or other vectorized loads/stores if applicable
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory if adopted
