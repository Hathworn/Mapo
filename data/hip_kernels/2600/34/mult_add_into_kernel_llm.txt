```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for better memory coalescing
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce uncoalesced global memory reads
// Ensure proper alignment of data in memory to improve memory access efficiency
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching if data locality can be predicted
```
