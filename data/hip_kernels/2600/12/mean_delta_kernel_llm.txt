```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data layout
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access
// Unroll inner loops where possible to reduce loop overhead
// Explore occupancy optimizations by adjusting block size
// Align data accesses to improve memory load/store efficiency
