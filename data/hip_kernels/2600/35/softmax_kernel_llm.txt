```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Replace atomicMax and atomicAdd with warp-level primitives for better performance.
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous blocks access contiguous segments of memory.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Consider launching with a more optimal grid and block size that maximizes occupancy.
