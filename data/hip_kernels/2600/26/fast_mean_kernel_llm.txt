```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory coherence
// Initialize shared memory to begin accumulation
// Unroll the loop to increase instruction level parallelism
// Check boundary conditions to avoid invalid memory access
// Accumulate values in local shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use atomic operations for shared memory reduction to ensure correct results
// Compute mean efficiently by dividing the sum at the end
