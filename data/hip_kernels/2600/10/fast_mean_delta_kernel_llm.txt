// Consider using warp shuffle functions for faster reduction operations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and ensuring sequential thread access patterns.
// Evaluate memory access patterns and replace global memory access with shared memory where possible.
// Use vectorized operations to accelerate memory read/write operations.
