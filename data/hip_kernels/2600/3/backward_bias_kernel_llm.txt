```
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'delta' array to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts in 'part' array.
// Use loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead in the main computation loop.
// Ensure that the 'BLOCK' size is optimized for the GPU's warp size for best performance.
// Implement occupancy analysis to balance block size and register usage for higher efficiency.
