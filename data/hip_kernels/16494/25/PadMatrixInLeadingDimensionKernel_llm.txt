```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to reduce global memory loads.
// Evaluate using half precision or integer arithmetic if precision requirements allow to improve performance.
// Minimize branch divergence within the warp by ensuring threads in the same warp execute the same instructions.
