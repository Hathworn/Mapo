// Use shared memory to temporarily store row_sum and col_sum for faster access.
// Consider using atomic operations if data synchronization is required across threads.
// Implement loop unrolling to potentially reduce extra conditional checks.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
