```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for hiprandState to improve performance
// Minimize shared memory usage to allocate more registers per thread
// Optimize block size and grid size based on hardware for load balancing
// Consider warp-level primitives for synchronization if needed
// Ensure alignment of hiprandState to prevent misaligned memory access
// Preload seed value to reduce redundant memory accesses
```
