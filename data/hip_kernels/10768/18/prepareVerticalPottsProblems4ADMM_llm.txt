// Coalesce memory accesses to improve global memory throughput in v and in arrays  
// Align memory accesses of weights and weightsPrime with warp size  
// Avoid redundant recalculations of weightsIndex by storing it in a register  
// Consider using shared memory for weights and weightsPrime to decrease global memory latency  
// Optimize thread block and grid dimensions to improve occupancy and memory bandwidth utilization
