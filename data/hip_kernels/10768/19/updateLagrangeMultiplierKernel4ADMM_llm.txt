```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve bandwidth
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce access latency
// Consider using loop unrolling for performance when applicable
```
