// Consider reducing global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Reduce repeated index calculations by storing them in variables
// Minimize arithmetic operations inside loops to save computation time
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling for performance gain
// Consider using vectorized operations to optimize floating-point calculations
