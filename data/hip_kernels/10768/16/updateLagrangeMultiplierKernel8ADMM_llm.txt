// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access
// Try to use coalesced memory access patterns when accessing the u, v, w_, z arrays
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead of loop management
// Optimize the index calculation to minimize redundant computation inside kernels
