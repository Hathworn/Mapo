```
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure coalesced memory reads.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block.
// Ensure weights and weightsPrime arrays are accessed with minimal stride.
// Align data structures to prevent bank conflicts and improve performance.
// Prefetch data to reduce memory access latency.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
