```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts.
// Explore using shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory latency.
// Check if loop unrolling in the kernel could improve performance by reducing control overhead.
// Investigate the use of warp shuffle functions for efficient intra-warp communication.
// Evaluate if vectorized data loads/store can be utilized for memory throughput optimization.
// Assess memory access alignment to maximize throughput on the memory transaction level.
// Analyze if using constant memory for read-only data can reduce global memory access time.
