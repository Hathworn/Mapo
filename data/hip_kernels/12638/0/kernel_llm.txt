```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to enhance memory performance
// Prefetching data into shared memory could reduce global memory latency
// Grouping consecutive accesses may reduce memory transaction overhead
// Using warp-synchronous programming can help minimize divergence
// Consider loop unrolling if there's repetitive computation
