```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that each thread accesses a contiguous region of memory to maximize coalescing.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Align data structures to prevent unaligned memory accesses and potential performance penalties.
// Evaluate the occupancy of the kernel and adjust block size to ensure high efficiency.
