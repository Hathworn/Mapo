// Ensure shared memory is optimized by reusing its usage efficiently
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access for better performance
// Coalesce global memory accesses to maximize memory throughput
// Minimize shared memory usage where possible to allow more blocks to execute concurrently
// Ensure that each thread computes only necessary data to reduce redundant calculations
// Try using loop unrolling to reduce the loop overhead and enhance performance
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores to exploit memory bandwidth fully
