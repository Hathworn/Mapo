// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure thread synchronization with __syncthreads() when accessing shared memory.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for matC by ensuring continuous thread access.
// Ensure boundary checks to avoid out-of-bound accesses, especially when loading shared memory.
