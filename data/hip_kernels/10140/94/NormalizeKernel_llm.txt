// Consider coalesced global memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic for data accessed multiple times
// Investigate loop unrolling for potential performance gains, especially for fixed size blocks
// Apply occupancy optimizations by experimenting with block size configuration
