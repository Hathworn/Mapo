```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize thread block dimensions to maximize GPU occupancy.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes.
// Use __shared__ memory wisely to reduce register pressure.
// Consider warp-level optimizations to better utilize available resources.
// Review performance with different values of image_stride and flow_stride.
