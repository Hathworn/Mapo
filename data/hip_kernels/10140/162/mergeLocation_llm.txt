```
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced by checking pointer alignment.
// Use shared memory if beneficial to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by loading data into registers.
// Consider memory access patterns to improve cache utilization.
// Evaluate the impact of using float2 instead of separate float arrays for x and y.
// Consider loop unrolling if deeper loops exist or larger data is processed.
