```c
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Aim to combine memory accesses through coalesced reads from global memory.
// Use texture memory for read-only data to benefit from cached memory access.
// Balance the workload across threads to enhance performance scaling.
