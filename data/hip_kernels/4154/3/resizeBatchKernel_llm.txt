```
// Optimize data access patterns to enhance coalescing and reduce bank conflicts.
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditions where possible.
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to decrease global memory accesses.
// Ensure optimal thread block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Consider loop unrolling for improvement in computational efficiency.
