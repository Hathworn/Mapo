```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Ensure memory reads are coalesced by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Perform loop unrolling for operations within the kernel to reduce instruction overhead
// Try to balance the block size and grid size to optimize for the specific GPU architecture
// Minimize divergent branching to improve warp execution efficiency
```
