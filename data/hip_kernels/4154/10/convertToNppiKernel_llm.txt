// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by organizing threads appropriately
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data like lookupTable
// Optimize the loop unrolling factor considering the register pressure and occupancy
// Ensure warp alignment to reduce branching and divergence
