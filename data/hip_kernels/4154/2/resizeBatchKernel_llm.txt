```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning global memory writes
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for optimized access patterns since the source image data is read-only
// Pre-compute indices more efficiently to reduce calculation repetitions
// Ensure blocks and threads are configured to maximize occupancy and minimize divergence
