```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Load Y, U, V components into shared memory to minimize repeated accesses.
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations by reusing computed values.
// Align memory accesses with warp size to improve coalescence.
// Ensure lookupTable is cached for faster access.
