```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize loading of uint16_t data by coalescing accesses to ensure memory transactions are efficient.
// Implement loop unrolling in processPixel calculations for improved performance.
// Precompute constants used in processPixel to reduce redundant calculations within the loop.
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring conditions to favor warp-wide decisions.
// Evaluate the potential of launching smaller blocks to exploit better cache usage.
