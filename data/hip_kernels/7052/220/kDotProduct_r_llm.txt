// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, improving data locality.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper memory access patterns.
// Use loop unrolling to optimize reduction within shared memory for faster computation.
// Utilize volatile memory access for the last warp to prevent compiler optimization issues and ensure correct results.
// Align thread count with the warp size to optimize reduction using warp efficiency.
