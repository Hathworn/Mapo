```
// Align data types for coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory if there is data re-use within the thread block
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to aid compiler optimizations
// Optimize loop unrolling by allowing the compiler to unroll for small fixed-size loops
// Reduce branch divergence by reordering conditional checks if possible
```
