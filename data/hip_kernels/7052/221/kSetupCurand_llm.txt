```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Align data structures if possible to enhance memory access efficiency
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
