```cpp
// Precompute log_energy_floor outside of loop for efficiency to avoid redundant calculations
// Use blockDim.x instead of CU1DBLOCK for better clarity and maintainability
// Direct multiply for optimized assignment to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider using cooperative groups for more fine-grained parallelism and synchronization
// Thread 0 for each frame applies energy to reduce branching and improve performance
