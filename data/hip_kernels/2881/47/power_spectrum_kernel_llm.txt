```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring memory coalescing in global reads from Ar.
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure that Aw writes are coalesced to maximize memory throughput.
// Use float2 for complex number operations to utilize paired loads and stores.
// Investigate potential for loop unrolling to reduce control overhead.
// Consider banking conflict avoidance in shared memory, if applied.
// Profile different block and grid dimensions to find optimal occupancy.
