```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global reads and writes.
// Loading inputs into shared memory reduces the number of global memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to minimize bank conflicts and maximize throughput.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reductions or scans when applicable.
// Evaluate thread block size to align with the warp size for optimal execution.
// Ensure efficient use of shared memory by optimizing memory allocation and usage.
// Use __syncthreads() only where necessary to avoid performance bottlenecks.
// Analyze the impact of divergent branches and minimize where possible.
