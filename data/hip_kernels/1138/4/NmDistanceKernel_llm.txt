```
// Consider increasing the batch size if shared memory usage and occupancy allow.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for xyz2.
// Achieve coalesced access to global memory for loading xyz2 data into buf.
// Consider tuning block and grid dimensions for better balance of occupancy and latency hiding.
// Unroll the inner loop for processing batches for better performance and ILP.
// After loop unrolling, handle remaining elements outside the unrolled loop.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded their data into shared memory.
