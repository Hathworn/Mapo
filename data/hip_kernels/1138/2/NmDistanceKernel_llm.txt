```
// Consider using shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory throughput
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads for data consistency in shared memory
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance computational efficiency and reduce loop overhead
// Use FLT_MAX macro for initialization of float variables for readability and precision
