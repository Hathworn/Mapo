// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better memory throughput.
// Consider using shared memory or registers for intermediate computations to reduce global memory traffic.
// Investigate warp-level parallelism to minimize thread divergences.
// Evaluate the use of memory prefetching techniques to improve data transfer efficiency.
// Adjust the grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads.
