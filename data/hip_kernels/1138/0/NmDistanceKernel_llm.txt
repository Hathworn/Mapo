// Increase memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Unroll loops to enhance throughput and reduce latency
// Ensure buffer allocation size matches batch requirement
// Synchronize threads before accessing shared data to avoid race conditions
