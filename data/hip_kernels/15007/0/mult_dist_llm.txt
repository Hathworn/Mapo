```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning d_A and d_B loading operations
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize synchronization overhead by grouping loads and computation
// Adjust block dimension to match warp size for better performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access for optimal speed
