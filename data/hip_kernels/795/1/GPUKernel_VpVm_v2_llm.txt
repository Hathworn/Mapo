// Consider adjusting shared memory size based on actual block size needs.
// Ensure all data fits in shared memory to improve access speed.
// Minimize global memory access by fully utilizing shared memory.
// Coalesced access to global memory will increase throughput.
// Consider using vectorized loads if appropriate for data alignment.
