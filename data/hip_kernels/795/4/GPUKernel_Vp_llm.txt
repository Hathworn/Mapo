```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for in and out arrays
// Minimize branch divergence by reorganizing thread execution
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable in unshown dimensions
// Optimize arithmetic operations to reduce instruction count
// Check for opportunities to use half precision to save bandwidth
// Evaluate warp-level primitives for potential performance improvements
