```c
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring coalesced global memory access for input[] and delta[].
// Use shared memory to cache data that is accessed multiple times to reduce global memory transactions.
// Consider loop unrolling for operations that update delta array to improve instruction throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches by rearranging conditions if possible to enhance warp efficiency.
// Pre-compute constant values like 2.0f / imageWidth and 2.0f / imageHeight outside the kernel for reuse.
