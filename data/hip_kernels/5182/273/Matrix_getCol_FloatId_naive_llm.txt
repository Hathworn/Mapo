// Consider using shared memory for block-level data reuse to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance.
// Implement loop unrolling for memory-bound segments to enhance throughput.
// Ensure the alignment of data structures for efficient global memory access.
