// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for 'input' to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure 'retinaMask' is accessed in a coalesced manner to avoid performance penalties.
// Investigate using shared memory for 'retinaMask' to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to match the warp size for effective utilization.
