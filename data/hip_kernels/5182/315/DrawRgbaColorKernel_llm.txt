```cpp
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory if multiple threads access nearby memory locations
// Minimize divergent branches by optimizing condition checks and loops
// Improve performance by using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers when no aliasing occurs
// Use texture memory for read-only data if possible to benefit from caching
// Consider using vectorized operations if the hardware supports them
```
