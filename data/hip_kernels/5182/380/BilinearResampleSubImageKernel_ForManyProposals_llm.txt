```
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize coalesced reads from global memory.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate values if multiple threads access the same data.
// Prefer `__restrict__` keyword for pointers to allow the compiler to assume no aliasing.
// Minimize divergent branches, especially within the main computation loop of the kernel.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to prevent inefficient memory access.
// Consider using texture memory if the access pattern demonstrates spatial locality.
