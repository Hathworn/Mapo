// Precompute avgWeightGradPtr values outside the loop to reduce memory access.
// Cache avgGrad in a register for faster repeated usage.
// Use shared memory for weightsGradPtr and shiftedWeightsPtr if possible to improve data access speed.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize reduction.
// Ensure loop unrolling for better pipeline utilization.
// Avoid branching by consolidating similar operations.
