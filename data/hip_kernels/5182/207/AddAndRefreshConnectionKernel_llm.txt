```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider using atomic operations if updating shared data is required across threads
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
