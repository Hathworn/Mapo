```
// Use shared memory for outputActivations and outputActivationDerivatives to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by organizing data in a structure of arrays.
// Consider prefetching data from global to shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to ensure maximum occupancy and minimize idle threads.
