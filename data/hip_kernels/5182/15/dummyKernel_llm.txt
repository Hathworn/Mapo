```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance
// Utilize shared memory where applicable to reduce global memory access
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for full occupancy
// Ensure memory access is aligned for best throughput
// Minimize divergent branching within kernel execution
