```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring the pointers are aligned in memory.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses and bandwidth.
// Ensure that the thread block size is a multiple of warp size (32) for better performance.
// Avoid divergent branches by structuring conditional statements to minimize warp divergence.
// Prefetch data to registers where possible to minimize global memory read latency.
