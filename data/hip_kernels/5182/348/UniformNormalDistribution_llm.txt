```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Use memory coalescing to ensure that threads access contiguous memory locations to improve throughput
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of the warp size for optimal performance
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory by appropriately aligning data
// Consider using constant memory for frequently accessed scalar constants to reduce global memory load latency
