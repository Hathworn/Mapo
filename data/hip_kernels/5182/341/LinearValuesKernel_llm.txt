```
// Precompute and broadcast invariant values, like 'delta', outside of loop structures where possible.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses and improve data locality.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for 'output' array to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Avoid bank conflicts in accessing shared memory if implemented.
// Consider using a strided approach for load/store operations to balance workload and reduce idle threads.
