// Consider using shared memory for weightMemBlock if it is accessed frequently
// Avoid branching by using a single computation formula: output = (1 - weight) * input1 + weight * input2
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning input and output arrays in global memory
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if applicable to aid in compiler optimizations
// Explore using __ldg() function to load input data if they are read-only and frequently accessed
