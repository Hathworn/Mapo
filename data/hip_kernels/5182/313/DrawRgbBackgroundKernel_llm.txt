```
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse among threads to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses among threads in a warp.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Use constant memory for the values of r, g, and b if these do not change per kernel launch.
