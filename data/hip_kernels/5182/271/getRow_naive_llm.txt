```
// Combine memory accesses within a warp to improve coalescing
// Ensure *row_id is loaded outside the kernel for better locality
// Use shared memory if reusing A[rowOffset] across multiple blocks
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a block perform the same operation
// Prefetch *row_id value to reduce latency
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if Acols is a multiple of 4 for efficiency
// Align data structures to 64 bytes if possible for optimal access
