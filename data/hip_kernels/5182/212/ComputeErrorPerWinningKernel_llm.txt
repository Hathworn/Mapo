```
// Consider using shared memory to store localError and winningCount for reduced global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that localError and winningCount are accessed in a contiguous manner.
// Adjust block size and grid size for improved occupancy and load balancing.
// Ensure that errorPerWinning is also accessed coalescently for better memory throughput.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling can provide performance benefits in this context.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers if appropriate to assist the compiler in optimization.
