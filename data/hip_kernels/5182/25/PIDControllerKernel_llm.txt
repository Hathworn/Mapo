```
// Consider using shared memory to cache goal and input data for better memory access patterns.
// Use loop unrolling for operations inside the if block to reduce loop overhead.
// Prefetch inputs into registers to minimize global memory reads.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size if it can improve memory coalescing.
