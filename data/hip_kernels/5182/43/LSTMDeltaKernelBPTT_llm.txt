```
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory for frequently accessed data within block.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning access patterns where possible.
// Reduce register usage by leveraging shared memory and loop unrolling.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to enhance performance for reduction operations.
// Evaluate using half-precision arithmetic if the precision requirements allow, for improved throughput.
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap computation and data transfer.
