```cpp
// Ensure subImageDefs is read efficiently to avoid memory latency
// Reduce the number of condition checks by combining min/max operations
// Consider restructuring loops or using shared memory to reduce repeated calculations
// Avoid accessing global memory multiple times for the same data within loops
// Precompute repeated calculations outside the loop as possible constants
// Use floating-point constants for calculations to avoid implicit conversions
// Optimize atomic operations by reducing contention or using warp-level primitives
