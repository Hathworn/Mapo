```cpp
// Use strided loop for better memory coalescing
// Ensure that grid and block dimensions are balanced to maximize device utilization
// Consider using shared memory if additional operations require intermediate storage
// Prefetch next data elements if possible to hide latency
// Ensure proper alignment of data in global memory for efficient access
// Analyze occupancy to ensure that the kernel efficiently uses available resources
