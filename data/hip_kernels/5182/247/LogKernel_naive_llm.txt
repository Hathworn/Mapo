```
// Consider increasing threadIdx.x for coalesced memory access
// Ensure A is aligned in memory for optimal access patterns
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for performance tuning
// Use __restrict__ qualifier if A and out0 pointers do not alias
// Load data into shared memory if accessing A multiple times
