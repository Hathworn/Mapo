```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if the input data has locality
// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize the usage of registers by minimizing the calculation inside the loop
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied for additional performance gain
// Check if weight can be loaded into shared memory for faster access if it is constant
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by using appropriate block size and grid size
