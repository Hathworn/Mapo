```
// Consider improving memory access patterns by coalescing global memory reads and writes.
// Ensure that random number generation accesses are aligned and non-divergent.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Investigate if using registers could help in reducing memory bandwidth requirements.
// Review if loop unrolling further benefits SIMD performance in this context.
// Explore optimizing `hiprand` state initialization if multiple threads perform similar computations.
