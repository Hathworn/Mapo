```
// Use shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory latency
// Prefetch data to hide global memory latency and improve data access efficiency
// Consider coalescing memory access for out0[id] to utilize memory bandwidth
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have finished writing to shared memory
