```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for inputWeights and inputWeightDeltas
// Use shared memory for inputWeightRTRLDerivatives if possible to reduce global memory access
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Optimize use of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
```
