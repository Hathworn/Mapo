```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider transposing blocks to improve memory coalescing
// Evaluate read/write patterns for better caching
// Prefetch data into registers before computation
// Investigate warp-level operations for further optimization
// Assess occupancy using different block sizes
// Consider data alignment to leverage vectorized loads
