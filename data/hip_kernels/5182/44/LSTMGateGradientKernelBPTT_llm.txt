```
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by aligning memory access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize conditional checks by restructuring branching logic.
// Use bool instead of int for flags to reduce register usage.
// Precompute index offsets outside critical paths to reduce redundant calculations.
// Minimize divergence by handling special cases outside the critical computation loop.
// Consider loop unrolling for weight gradient computation to improve parallel workload.
