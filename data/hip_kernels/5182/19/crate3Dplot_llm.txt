```
// Use coalesced memory access by organizing threads to access contiguous memory addresses
// Minimize the usage of global memory by storing frequently accessed data in shared memory
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable additional compiler optimizations
// Use appropriate grid and block dimensions to ensure high occupancy
// Ensure that the 'if' condition minimizes warp divergence among threads
// Align data to ensure optimal memory access patterns and reduce cache misses
