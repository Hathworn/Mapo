```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for activityFlag array to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize memory layout of the connection array to ensure aligned memory access patterns.
// Employ shared memory or register caching for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory bottlenecks.
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements if possible.
// Ensure localError array accesses are coalesced for better memory throughput.
// Evaluate potential use of atomic operations if concurrent updates are made outside of the single-thread context.
