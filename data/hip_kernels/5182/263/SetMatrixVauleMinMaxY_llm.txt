// Consider coalesced memory access by organizing the data if possible.
// Ensure that `matrix` is allocated adequately to avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if shared memory can be utilized to reduce global memory access frequency.
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to increase efficiency in boundary checks.
