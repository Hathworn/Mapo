```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if there's data reuse across threads to minimize global memory access
// Ensure that all memory accesses are aligned to improve global memory throughput
// Avoid branch divergence to maintain warp execution efficiency
// Evaluate occupancy and ensure full utilization of compute resources and memory bandwidth
