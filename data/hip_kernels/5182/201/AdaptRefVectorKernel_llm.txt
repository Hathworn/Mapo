```
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced access
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler with optimization
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to benefit from hardware optimizations
// Minimize the usage of expensive functions inside the loop
