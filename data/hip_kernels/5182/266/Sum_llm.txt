// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within the kernel
// Minimize global memory accesses by using local variables where possible
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate warp divergence due to conditional statement and optimize if possible
// Align memory allocations to ensure optimal memory access pattern
