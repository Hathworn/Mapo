```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for opImage to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Preload subImageDefs into shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to preload input values if they are reused, reducing global memory access latency.
// Optimize thread block and grid size for better occupancy and balancing computation with memory bandwidth.
// Ensure atomicAdd operations are necessary; if possible, eliminate them by using shared memory reduction.
