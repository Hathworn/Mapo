```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory reads for 'delta'
// Initialize 'delta' once per block to minimize redundant calculations
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve execution time
// Use ternary operators to simplify and streamline branching logic
// Ensure valid index access to avoid branch divergence and memory errors
