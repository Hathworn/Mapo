// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input and output arrays
// Use constant memory for coefficients if they remain unchanged
// Optimize grid and block size configuration to minimize idle threads
// Balance load by adjusting block size according to input size
