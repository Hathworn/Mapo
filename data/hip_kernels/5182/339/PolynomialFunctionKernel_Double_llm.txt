```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory transactions
// Use shared memory to cache input data if multiple accesses are needed, reducing global memory bandwidth
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of 32 to maximize warp efficiency
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp take the same execution path
