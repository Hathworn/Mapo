```
// Optimize memory access by minimizing bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Consider restructuring the kernel to better utilize memory coalescing.
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores if applicable for wider data sizes.
// Investigate possible use of texture memory for read-only accessing of large data arrays.
// Reconsider thread block dimensions to optimize for throughput while minimizing warp divergence.
