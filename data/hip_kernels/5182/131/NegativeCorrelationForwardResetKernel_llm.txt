```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for outputPtr to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Review thread block size to ensure optimal occupancy and performance regarding the target device
// Use shared memory if possible for intermediate calculations to minimize global memory access
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to reduce potential memory access penalties
// Check if asynchronous memory copy can overlap with computations for improved efficiency
