```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for `distance` and `biasedDistance` arrays.
// Ensure that data is aligned to avoid misaligned memory accesses.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if reuse across threads is expected.
// Consider using vectorized operations if supported by hardware.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring workload per thread is balanced.
