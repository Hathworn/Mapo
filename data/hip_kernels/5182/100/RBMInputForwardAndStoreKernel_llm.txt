```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring inputPtr, outputPtr, and storePtr are accessed sequentially.
// Use shared memory to cache biasPtr if applyBias is frequently true, reducing global memory accesses.
// Verify if float2 or float4 operations can be used for vectorized memory accesses for optimization.
// Align inputPtr, outputPtr, storePtr, and biasPtr to 128 bytes to enable more efficient memory transactions.
// Minimize warp divergence by reordering conditions to reduce conditional branches.
