```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts by organizing data access patterns efficiently
// Utilize shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access
// Reduce divergent branches in the kernel to improve warp efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase performance
// Align memory access to improve memory transaction efficiency
