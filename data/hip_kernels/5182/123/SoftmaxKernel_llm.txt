// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve bandwidth usage.
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop iterations are small and predictable.
// Use memory coalescing for outputPtr to optimize data access patterns.
// Ensure enough threads are in each block to maximize GPU utilization.
