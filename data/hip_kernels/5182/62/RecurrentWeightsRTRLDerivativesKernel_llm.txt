```
// Utilize shared memory to store recurrent weights and reduce global memory access times.
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal warp efficiency and to minimize idle threads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve data throughput for recurrentWeightRTRLDerivatives.
// Perform warp-level shuffles for reductions to benefit from faster exchange of values without shared memory.
// Optimize the thread block size to match the SM architecture's warp size for better resource utilization.
