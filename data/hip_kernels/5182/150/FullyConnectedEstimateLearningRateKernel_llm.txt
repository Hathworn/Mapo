```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache small arrays like avgWeightGrad for reduced global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop iterating over prevLayerSize for performance benefits.
// Align memory accesses for coalesced global memory access patterns.
// Assess the possibility of using __ldg for read-only data to optimize cache usage.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring aligned access when using shared memory.
