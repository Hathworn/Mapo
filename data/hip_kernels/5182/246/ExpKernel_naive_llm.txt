```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads from A.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring its size is appropriately dimensioned.
// Minimize synchronization by reducing dependency on __syncthreads() where possible.
// Ensure out0 writes are coalesced for better memory efficiency.
// Explore loop unrolling for potential additional performance gains in parallel execution.
