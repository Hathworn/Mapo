```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for efficient memory coalescing
// Explore warp shuffle operations to reduce shared memory usage
// Consider loop unrolling for small matrix dimensions
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal coalescing
// Profile to identify potential bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Consider using asynchronous copy for data transfer to/from shared memory
