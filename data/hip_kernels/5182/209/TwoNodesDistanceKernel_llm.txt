```c
// Optimize memory access by loading data into shared memory before computation
// Consider using warp-based parallel reduction for faster summation
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading twoNodesDifference
// Use __syncthreads() if shared memory is implemented to synchronize threads
// Evaluate if using a separate kernel for parts of the computation improves performance
