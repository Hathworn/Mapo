```
// Utilize shared memory to cache texture data locally for faster access.
// Consider texture memory for linear interpolation if supported.
// Minimize divergent branching by unifying condition checks.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Prefetch data to registers wherever possible to hide latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns to be coalesced.
