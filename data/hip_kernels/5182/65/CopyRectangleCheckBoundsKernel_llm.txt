```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for src and dest arrays by ensuring threads access consecutive elements
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory load
// Ensure src and dest arrays are aligned for better memory access patterns
// Minimize divergence by checking bounds outside of the main processing loop
// Explore using the __restrict__ keyword to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
