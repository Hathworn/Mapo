```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Align texture data access to benefit from L2 cache locality
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory fetch latencies
// Optimize thread block size to maximize GPU occupancy
// Ensure global memory accesses are within warp boundaries to avoid bank conflicts
