```
// Utilize shared memory to cache globalFlow data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing when accessing velocities array to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider vectorizing operations if supported to reduce instruction overhead
// Minimize divergence by organizing if conditions based on likely branches
// Evaluate the current block and grid size configuration for optimal occupancy and performance
