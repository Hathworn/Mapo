```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for mins and maxes arrays.
// Ensure input array elements are accessed contiguously for coalesced writes.
// Align inputCount to block size for better occupancy.
// Use shared memory if mins and maxes have repeated accesses within a block.
// Check for unused variables and parameters to reduce register pressure.
