// Consider using shared memory to cache input data and avoid redundant global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring input and output pointers are aligned.
// Evaluate reducing multiple grid dimensions to simplify indexing calculations.
// Use warp-level primitives for possible optimization in cases of divergent threads.
