```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads of pointsCoordinates
// Consider further unrolling the loop to increase utilization
// Use more shared memory if blockDim.x is small to maximize usage
// Minimize use of atomic operations in performance-critical sections
// Ensure pointsCoordinates is aligned for optimal memory access
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Consider load balancing for irregular activityFlag patterns
