```
// Use shared memory to cache symbol vectors for coalesced access and reduce global memory traffic
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize performance by reducing the overhead of loop control
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve memory read/write efficiency
// Evaluate the use of registers for frequently accessed variables to minimize memory latency
// Consider occupancy analysis to determine optimal block and grid sizes for better resource utilization
