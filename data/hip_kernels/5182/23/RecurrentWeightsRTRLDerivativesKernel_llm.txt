// Use shared memory for inputs to improve cache hits
// Prefetch recurrentWeights and previousRecurrentWeightRTRLDerivatives into shared memory
// Ensure the threads are synchronized after loading data into shared memory
// Partition the workload to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Optimize the loop by unrolling it for performance improvement
