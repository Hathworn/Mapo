```
// Optimize global memory access by coalescing loads from difference array
// Utilize shared memory more effectively by reducing bank conflicts
// Schedule threads to minimize idle time during shared memory loads
// Ensure shared memory usage stays within limits to avoid spills
// Consider loop unrolling within the compute loop for better performance
// Use warp-level primitives if applicable for further optimization
// Verify occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance
