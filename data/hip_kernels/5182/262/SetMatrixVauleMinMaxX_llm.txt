```
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate if shared memory can be utilized to reduce global memory reads/writes.
// Ensure memory accesses within a warp are aligned to avoid bank conflicts.
// Investigate occupancy and adjust block size or grid size for better utilization.
// Minimize divergent branches within warp to improve execution efficiency.
// Profile memory access patterns and optimize for more contiguous access.
