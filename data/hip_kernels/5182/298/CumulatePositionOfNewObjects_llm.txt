// Simplify index calculations to avoid redundant operations
// Optimize memory access by implementing shared memory for mask and maskNewIds arrays if reused frequently
// Ensure proper coalesced memory access for mask, maskNewIds, and maskOut arrays
// Avoid excessive atomic operations by reducing contention on centers using warp-level reduction techniques
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable in areas with predictable and repetitive computation
// Use fast math intrinsics selectively for higher performance computation
