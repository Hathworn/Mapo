```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for coalesced memory reads.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure bank conflicts are minimized when using shared memory.
// Align data access according to warp size to prevent divergence.
// Try eliminating branches or using predication for conditional statements.
// Consider unrolling loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Precompute index calculations that are used repeatedly to reduce computation.
// Assess the need for atomic operations in cases of data dependencies.
