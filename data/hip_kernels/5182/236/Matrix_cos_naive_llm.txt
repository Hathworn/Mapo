```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance
// Ensure memory alignment for the input array A
// Use shared memory if there are shared computations between threads
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data within shared memory
// Utilize loop unrolling for the cosine computation if applicable
// Consider using mathematical approximations for faster cosine calculations
