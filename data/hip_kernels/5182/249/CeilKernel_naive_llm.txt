```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead if appropriate.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal GPU performance.
// Optimize block and grid size for better utilization of the GPU resources.
// Double check for bank conflicts in shared memory if applied.
