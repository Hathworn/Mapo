```
// Use shared memory for outputActivations and outputActivationDerivatives to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory access for target array to optimize memory transactions
// Consider using float2 for accessing target and outputActivations if possible to increase memory access efficiency
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to improve coalescing
