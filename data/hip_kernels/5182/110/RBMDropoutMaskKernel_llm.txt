```
// Consider coalescing memory access to maskPtr by ensuring maskPtr is accessed in sequential order.
// Investigate if shared memory can be utilized to temporarily store mask values to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory access patterns align with warp boundaries to prevent serialization of memory transactions.
