```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache pointsCoordinates data to reduce global memory access
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to improve memory access optimization
// Unroll loops if possible to increase instruction level parallelism
// Consider aligning memory accesses to 128 bytes to improve coalescing
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider splitting the kernel if it leads to better load balancing across SMs
// Optimize the use of registers by limiting the number of variables in the kernel
// Use padding or alignment for better memory coalescing
