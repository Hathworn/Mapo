```c
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory loads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Assess thread divergence and attempt to minimize branching within the kernel.
// Evaluate the impact of atomic operations on performance and explore alternatives if necessary.
