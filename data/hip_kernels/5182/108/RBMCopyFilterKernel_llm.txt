```c
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access.
// Minimize the use of shared memory unless absolutely necessary.
// Consider using asynchronous data transfers for better overlap of computation and data movement.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to maximize memory throughput.
// Investigate using texture or surface memory for frequent read patterns.
