```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input and referenceVector to improve memory throughput.
// Align data structures in memory to ensure natural alignment and prevent misaligned accesses.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses when reusing data within a block.
// Unroll loops manually if present to reduce loop overhead and improve performance, if applicable.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifiers to help the compiler with aliasing optimizations.
