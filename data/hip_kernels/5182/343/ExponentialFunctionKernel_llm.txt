// Consider coalesced memory access for input and output arrays
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Align memory allocations to avoid potential misalignment penalties
// Optimize block and grid size for maximum occupancy
