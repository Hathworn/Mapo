```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Align memory access to warp size to benefit from coalesced access
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Use __restrict__ pointers to give compiler more optimization opportunities
// Consider using cooperative groups for better memory access patterns
// Prefetch data to registers to hide memory latency
