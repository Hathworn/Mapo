```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns for arrays.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring proper alignment of shared memory access.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to indicate there are no aliasing pointers, allowing better compiler optimization.
// Consider optimizing the loop unrolling for the connection matrix updates for better performance.
// Ensure the kernel is launched with optimal block and grid size for the hardware.
// Pre-calculate and use baseIndex for connectionMatrix and connectionAge to avoid repeated computation.
