```c
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within each block to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize redundant memory loads within loops.
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput, especially for small fixed-size loops.
