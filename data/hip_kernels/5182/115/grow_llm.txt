```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for accessing 'chromosomes'
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditions
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations within loops
// Avoid recalculating the same index multiple times in loops
// Use `__syncthreads()` only when necessary to avoid synchronization overhead
