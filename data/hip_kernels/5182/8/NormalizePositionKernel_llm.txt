// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access overhead  
// Improve data parallelism by removing the threadId==0 condition and distributing work across more threads  
// Minimize conditional statements to improve warp execution efficiency  
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better performance  
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to allow compiler optimizations
