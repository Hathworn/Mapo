```
// Consider using shared memory for texture data to reduce global memory access
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring aligned memory accesses
// Use texture cache for accessing the texture array to improve memory read efficiency
// Prefetch texture data to registers to optimize memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for both texture and target arrays
// Group multiple operations to reduce arithmetic operations and improve performance
