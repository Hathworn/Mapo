```c
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to global memory for improved performance.
// Align shared memory initialization with warp size for efficient memory access.
// Use more threads to fill shared memory to achieve better utilization of SM resources.
// Reduce conditional statements inside the loop to decrease warp divergence.
// Ensure that atomic operations do not create contention among threads.
// Optimize thread block size and grid size to maximize occupancy.
