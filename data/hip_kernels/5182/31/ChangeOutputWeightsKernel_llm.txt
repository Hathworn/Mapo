```
// Optimize access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access for outputWeights and outputWeightDeltas.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory access patterns.
// Ensure that the product 'D_OUTPUT_UNITS * D_HIDDEN_UNITS' is aligned to the warp size for efficiency.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads when using shared memory to ensure data consistency.
// Minimize the usage of registers by optimizing arithmetic operations and loop unrolling if applicable.
