```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for element1 and element2.
// Pre-fetch data into registers to reduce memory access times.
// Utilize vectorized loads and stores if the hardware supports it.
// Ensure memory is aligned to enhance read/write throughput.
