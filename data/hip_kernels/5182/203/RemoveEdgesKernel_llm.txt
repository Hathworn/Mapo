// Use shared memory for activeConnections to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergent branches by combining similar conditions
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for connection and age arrays
// Use loop unrolling to increase pipeline efficiency for the inner loop
// Pad data structures to ensure memory alignment for coalesced access
