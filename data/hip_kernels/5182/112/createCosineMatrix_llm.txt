// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and minimize global memory access.
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Reduce divergent branches by consolidating conditions where possible.
// Precompute and store frequently used values in registers to reduce redundant calculations.
