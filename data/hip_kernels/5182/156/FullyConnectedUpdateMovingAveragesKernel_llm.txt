```
// Optimize for memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to improve speed
// Reduce conditional checks in the kernel for less divergence and better performance
// Utilize vectorized memory operations where applicable
// Pre-compute invariant calculations outside of the loop where possible
