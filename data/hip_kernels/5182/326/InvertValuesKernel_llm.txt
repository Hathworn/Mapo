```
// Consider coalesced memory access for input and outputs arrays
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the hardware
// Assess if shared memory can be utilized to further reduce latency
// Validate if loop unrolling can be applied for performance enhancement
// Profile for potential warp divergence and address if applicable
