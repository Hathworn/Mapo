```
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing global memory reads.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize redundant calculations, pre-calculate common expressions.
// Ensure thread divergence is minimized by avoiding unnecessary conditionals.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only input data to exploit caching.
// Ensure data alignment is optimal for memory access.
