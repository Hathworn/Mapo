// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure that the buffer array is aligned to optimize memory transactions
// Leverage shared memory if frequently accessed data can be reused
// Explore memory prefetching techniques for better latency hiding
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations for potential throughput improvements
