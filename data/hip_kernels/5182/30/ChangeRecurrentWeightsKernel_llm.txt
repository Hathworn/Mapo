```
// Use shared memory to further reduce global memory access
// Consider aligning data structures to cache lines for coalesced access
// Evaluate loop unrolling factor using device specifications for optimal performance
// Apply warp-level primitives to increase data parallelism
// Implement asynchronous memory copies where possible to overlap data transfer and computation
```
