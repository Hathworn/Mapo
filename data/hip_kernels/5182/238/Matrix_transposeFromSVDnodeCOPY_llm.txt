```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses by accessing memory in a linear fashion
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Use constant memory for invariant data if applicable
// Optimize block and grid size for better occupancy
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency
// Ensure memory alignment to improve access speed
