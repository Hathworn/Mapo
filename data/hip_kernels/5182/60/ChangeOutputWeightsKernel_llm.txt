```
// Consider using shared memory for hiddenActivations to reduce global memory access
// Use loop unrolling to improve computation efficiency for weight update
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize access latency from global memory
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to improve throughput efficiency
