```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for better memory access efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Use loop unrolling for the sequenceLength loop if it is determined to be small and fixed
// Verify that the kernel launch parameters (block and grid sizes) are optimized for the target GPU
