// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for global memory reads.
// Explore use of shared memory for partial result storage to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize loop with loop unrolling techniques to enhance computation parallelism.
// Possibly use atomic operations for reducing shared memory contents if race conditions occur.
