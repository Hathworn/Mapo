```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses where possible
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce repeated memory access
// Ensure data alignment for better memory access efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for performance gain
```
