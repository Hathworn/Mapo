```
// Optimization: Use constant memory if kernel size is fixed
// Optimization: Consider using shared memory for the input tiles to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Optimization: Align memory accesses if possible for better coalescing
// Optimization: Reduce divergence by avoiding branches inside loops if possible
