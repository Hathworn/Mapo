```
// Use coalesced memory access to ensure consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure the grid size is optimized to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
// Consider memory alignment for improved memory access performance
// Utilize shared memory if there's opportunity to reduce global memory access latency
