```cpp
// Consider aligning data accesses to ensure coalesced memory transactions
// Use loop unrolling more aggressively if registers allow
// Balance the use of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives for reduction if applicable
// Profile memory usage to ensure it fits within available resources
```
