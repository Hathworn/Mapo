// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by using a flattened index calculation.
// Verify alignment and memory padding to enhance access efficiency.
// Consider shared memory or asynchronous copy if applicable for repeated patterns.
// Optimize block and grid size to optimize occupancy and resource usage.
