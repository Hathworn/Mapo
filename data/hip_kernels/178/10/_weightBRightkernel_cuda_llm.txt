```
// Precompute indices to reduce repeated calculations and improve memory access
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables if possible
// Align memory access patterns with cache lines to minimize cache misses
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to leverage caching
// Optimize loop unrolling further to ensure it fits well with warp execution
// Ensure memory coalescing for global memory access
