// Pre-calculate indices to avoid repeated computation in the loop
// Use temporary variables to minimize repeated memory access
// Avoid redundant global memory accesses by storing repeated values in local variables
// Ensure all accesses are coalesced by using continuous block access patterns where possible
// Reduce the number of global memory writes by combining operations where applicable
