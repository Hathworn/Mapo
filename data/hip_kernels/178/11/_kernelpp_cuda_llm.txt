```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache dev_theta values to reduce global memory access.
// Use shared memory for dev_gridx and dev_gridy to optimize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Analyze if loop unrolling in the for loops could improve performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Consider merging loops when possible to reduce the number of iterations and improve memory locality.
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures in global memory.
