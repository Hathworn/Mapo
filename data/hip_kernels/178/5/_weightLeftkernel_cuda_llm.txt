```
// Use shared memory to cache dev_recon and reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using texture memory for dev_recon to take advantage of caching for repeated reads.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning dev_F and dev_G accesses along warp boundaries.
// Explore occupancy optimizations by adjusting block size to better fit shared memory limits.
// Investigate potential benefits of using asynchronous memory prefetches to hide latency.
// Examine if reducing precision from float to half could improve throughput without precision loss.
// Balance between computational complexity and memory bandwidth to ensure kernel efficiency.
