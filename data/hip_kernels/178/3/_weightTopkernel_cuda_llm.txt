```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for dev_F and dev_G updates
// Use shared memory to cache dev_recon values and reduce global memory loads
// Explore vectorized data types for dev_wg5 to improve memory throughput
// Check memory access patterns for dev_recon to ensure coalesced access
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance
// Profile to determine if more aggressive loop unrolling yields better performance
