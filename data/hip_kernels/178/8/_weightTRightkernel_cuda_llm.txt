```
// Precompute any repeated calculations and store them in local variables to reduce redundant computations.
// Utilize shared memory or registers to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider memory coalescing to optimize global memory access patterns for improved performance.
// Ensure that all kernel launches have the right configuration to maximize occupancy.
// Align data accesses to natural boundaries where possible to enhance memory throughput.
// Consider using __restrict__ properly to help the compiler with aliasing optimizations and enable better vectorization.
// Check the use of the __syncthreads() barrier if data dependency arises among threads in the block.
