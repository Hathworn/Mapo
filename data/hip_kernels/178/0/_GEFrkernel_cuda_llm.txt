// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning thread data access.
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure the shared memory array is appropriately sized and used efficiently.
// Prefetch data into shared memory for subsequent loop iterations to reduce global memory bandwidth.
