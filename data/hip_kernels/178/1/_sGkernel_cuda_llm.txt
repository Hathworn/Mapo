```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache dev_suma accesses for better memory efficiency.
// Optimize global memory accesses by ensuring aligned memory access patterns.
// Try reducing global memory traffic by reusing data already loaded in registers when possible.
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop inside the kernel exhibits a small, fixed trip count.
// Aim to minimize memory divergence by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns for dev_G.
// Check if merging loops could reduce redundant memory access and help in better cache utilization.
