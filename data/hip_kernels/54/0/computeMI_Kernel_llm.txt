```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by reorganizing data layout
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed variables
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same instruction path
// Reduce redundant computations by precomputing values where possible
// Optimize register usage to improve performance
```
