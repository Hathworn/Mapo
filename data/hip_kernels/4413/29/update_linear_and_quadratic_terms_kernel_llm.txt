```
// Consider using shared memory to cache cur_tot_weight for faster access
// Use thread coarsening to improve memory access patterns and reduce divergence
// Ensure coalesced access to the quadratic array by reordering data if possible
// Use asynchronous memory operations to overlap computation with memory transfer
// Explore loop unrolling in the quadratic updating loop for performance gain
// Minimize the use of atomic operations if memory consistency allows
