```
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated accesses to global memory for lifter coefficients
// Employ __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded lifter coefficients before using them
// Use parallel processing by assigning different threads to different columns to increase throughput
// Handle energy computation in thread 0 to minimize synchronization overhead
// Utilize conditional logic to prevent unnecessary computations for energy-floor application
