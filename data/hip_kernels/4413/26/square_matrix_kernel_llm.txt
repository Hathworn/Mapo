// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling if matrix dimensions are known at compile time.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Explore memory coalescing for better memory access patterns.
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency.
