```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses when initializing the `finished` array
// Evaluate if using shared memory could improve performance for small `round` values
// Check for potential warp divergence in the loop and minimize its impact
// Assess if loop unrolling would enhance performance given the loop's current bounds
// Investigate if larger block sizes can be utilized for better resource usage
