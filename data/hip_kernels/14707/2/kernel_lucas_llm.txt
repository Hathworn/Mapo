```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by checking if nArray, dArray, and rArray are aligned
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergent branches in the loop for better warp utilization
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease instruction overhead
