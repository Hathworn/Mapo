```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data like d_sPrimes
// Try coalescing memory accesses to n and r for improved performance
// Ensure n and r memory accesses are aligned to avoid uncoalesced access penalties
// Check if additional loop unrolling could further benefit the trial division loop
// Investigate the use of additional registers to keep intermediate results
