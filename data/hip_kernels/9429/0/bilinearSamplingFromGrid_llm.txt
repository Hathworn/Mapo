```
// Use __shared__ memory to load grid data for faster access and reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is called after loading data into shared memory to synchronize threads.
// Make use of fast local boolean checks to avoid accessing out-of-bound memory areas.
// Unroll loop iterations where applicable to reduce the loop overhead and enhance throughput.
