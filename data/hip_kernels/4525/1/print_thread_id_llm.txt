```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Avoid using printf in performance-critical GPU code to reduce potential slowdown.
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads in the same block access nearby memory locations frequently.
// Align memory accesses where possible to leverage faster memory transactions.
