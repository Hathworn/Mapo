```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by organizing x memory layout
// Ensure shared memory usage remains within limits for block size
// Unroll loops for performance gains in inner loop
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointer arguments to improve compiler optimizations
// Test and tune block size for best performance considering shared memory and occupancy
// Employ atomic operations if required for final reduction across blocks
```
