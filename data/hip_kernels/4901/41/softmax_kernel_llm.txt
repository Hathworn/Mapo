```
// Consider coalescing memory access for input and output arrays
// Leverage shared memory to store intermediate computations within the block
// Utilize vectorized memory operations (e.g., float2, float4) for faster data transfer
// Adjust block size and grid size to achieve optimal occupancy
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for input and output pointers to enable better compiler optimizations
