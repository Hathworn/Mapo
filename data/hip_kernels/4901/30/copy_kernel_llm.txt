```
// Consider coalesced memory access for both X and Y to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Unroll the loop further if registers and shared memory allow, to increase throughput.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if the working set fits, to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure memory alignment for X and Y to take full advantage of vectorized instructions.
// Use double buffering in shared memory to hide memory latency while increasing the overlap of computation and data transfer.
