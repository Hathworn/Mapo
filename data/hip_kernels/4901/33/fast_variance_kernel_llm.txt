// Consider utilizing shared memory more efficiently by avoiding excess usage
// Optimize memory coalescing for better performance in reading 'x' values
// Investigate if the spatial loop can be further unrolled for performance
// Evaluate the potential for warp-level reductions to optimize synchronization barriers
