```
// Optimize loops: reduce redundant calculations, leverage shared memory if needed
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing continuous memory locations
// Check boundaries outside of innermost loop for efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches by rearranging conditions
