```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Consider increasing thread block size for better parallelization
// Utilize shared memory more efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Ensure synchronization points are correctly placed to avoid race conditions
// Explore warp-level primitives for reduction operations
// Assess register usage to avoid spills and improve occupancy
