```c
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory sequentially
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for reuse within a block
// Evaluate the occupancy to ensure enough threads are launched for effective pipelining
// Use a stride loop to increase data reuse and reduce global memory load latency
```
