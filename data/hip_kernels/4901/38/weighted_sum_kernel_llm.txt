```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for arrays a, b, s, and c to improve performance
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure aligned memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Consider using loop unrolling if it benefits performance by reducing instruction overhead
// Explore warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations if applicable
