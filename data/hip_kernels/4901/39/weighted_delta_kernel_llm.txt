```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory access patterns are coalesced
// Load block-specific values into shared memory once to reduce redundant global memory access
// Synchronize threads within the block to ensure all have loaded shared values before use
// Consider adjusting thread block size for optimal occupancy and memory throughput
// Align memory accesses to increase coalescence
