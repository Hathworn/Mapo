```
// Consider using shared memory for accessing the image data to reduce global memory loads.
// Use texture memory for image data if possible to utilize cache efficiently.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced when reading and writing image data.
// Merge value computation for similar operations to minimize redundant calculations.
// Use float2 or float4 to fetch multiple float values at once if applicable.
// Avoid branch divergence by restructuring control flow to minimize divergent branches.
