```
// Use shared memory to load mean and variance values for faster access
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring x, mean, and variance are accessed sequentially
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for x for better throughput
// Ensure adequate occupancy by adjusting block size to maximize parallel execution
