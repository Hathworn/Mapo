```
// Use shared memory to cache delta values for improved memory access patterns
// Consider merging id calculation with threadIdx for reduced computation
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency
// Explore coalesced memory access patterns for reading from delta and writing to prev_delta
// Consider loop tiling to enhance data reuse
// Validate use of __syncthreads() if accessing shared resources or within diverged warps
// Optimize boundary checks for out_w and out_h to reduce unnecessary calculations
