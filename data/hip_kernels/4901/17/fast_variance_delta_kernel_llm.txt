```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for intermediate results
// Utilize loop unrolling to improve instruction throughput
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient reduction
// Reduce repeated computation of index within loops
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Explore the possibility of further unrolling the spatial loop
// Use __restrict__ keyword if possible to provide the compiler with more optimization opportunities
