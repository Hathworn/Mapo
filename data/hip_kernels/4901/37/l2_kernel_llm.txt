```
// Use shared memory to improve performance by reducing global memory access
// Correct error calculation placement to ensure accurate results
// Zero out extra thread memory usage to prevent stale data impact
// Parallel reduction within block to efficiently sum the errors
// Use __syncthreads to ensure all threads have completed their calculations before proceeding
// Write block error sum to global memory at the end to accumulate results
