```cpp
// Combine smaller accesses into larger coalesced reads to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within the loop.
// Ensure the input is aligned for optimal coalesced access.
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching if supported by the hardware.
// Reduce the redundant computation of indices and constants outside of loops.
