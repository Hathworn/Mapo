```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions for better workload balancing across threads
// Minimize the use of global memory accesses and prioritize registers where possible
