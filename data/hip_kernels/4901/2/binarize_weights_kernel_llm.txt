```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global reads and writes
// Minimize divergence by ensuring conditional statements are uniform
// Consider using warp-level operations to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure shared memory utilization is efficient and minimized
// Evaluate the necessity of atomic operations for calculating mean
