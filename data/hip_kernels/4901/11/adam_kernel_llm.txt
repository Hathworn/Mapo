// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like bias corrections if block-level reuse is possible.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring data alignment and avoiding bank conflicts.
// Use constant memory for fixed parameters like B1, B2, rate, eps, and t if they don't change during kernel execution.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling for computing powers or using mathematical approximations can improve performance.
