```
// Consider using shared memory for variance[i] to reduce global memory accesses.
// Pre-fetch delta[index] to registers to avoid frequent memory accesses.
// Optimize the accumulation loop with loop unrolling for better performance.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for delta array.
// Evaluate the use of warp-wise summation for sum calculation to utilize parallelism.
