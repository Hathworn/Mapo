```
// Use shared memory or L1 cache for frequently accessed data if possible
// Align data access patterns to improve memory coalescing
// Optimize the choice of block size to maximize warp occupancy
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if INCX is a multiple of vector width
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring INCX is set appropriately
