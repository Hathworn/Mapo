```
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated reads from global memory for output[ ].
// Use loop unrolling techniques to optimize the inner loop over size for reducing loop overhead.
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers in advance to reduce latency.
// Investigate opportunities for coalesced access to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Analyze if using half precision for float variables may provide performance benefits.
// Ensure the use of rsqrtf() does not introduce precision issues; consider alternatives if needed.
// Evaluate if reducing the number of atomicAdd operations can minimize contention.
