```
// Ensure memory access coalescing by aligning data structures
// Increase block size appropriately for better occupancy and performance
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Minimize use of __syncthreads to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider loop unrolling for increased computation efficiency
// Use memory access patterns that comply with warp size to reduce divergence
```
