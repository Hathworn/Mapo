```c
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for improved performance.
// Prefetch data into shared memory for pipeline optimization.
// Consider using vectorized memory access for A and C for better throughput.
// Optimize grid and block size to maximize occupancy while minimizing warp divergence.
