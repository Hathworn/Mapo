// Use predefined variables to reduce recomputation for improved performance.
// Try to minimize shared memory usage by using local variables where possible.
// Consider using vector operations for float data to optimize memory transactions.
// Optimize atomic operations to reduce contention and improve throughput.
// Examine memory access patterns to improve coalesced memory accesses.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques to reduce instruction overhead.
// Ensure alignment in memory accesses to enhance memory performance.
// Explore the use of texture memory for read-only data if applicable.
// Evaluate the potential of mixed precision to leverage faster computation.
