```
// Consider using shared memory for normalization_factor to reduce global memory access
// Use memory coalescing by accessing normalization_factor and image consecutively
// Prefetch data to registers for reuse within the thread block to minimize latency
// Ensure alignment of data structures for optimal memory transactions
