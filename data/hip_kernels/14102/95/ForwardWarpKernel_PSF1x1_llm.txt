```
// Consider coalesced memory access for loading u and v
// Ensure dst pointers are access-aligned to reduce bank conflicts
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize uncoalesced global memory operations
// Use shared memory if data reuse between threads in a block is possible
// Leverage unified memory for potential automatic data prefetching
