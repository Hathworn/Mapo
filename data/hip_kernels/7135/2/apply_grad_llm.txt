// Ensure the memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if the same data is accessed multiple times
// Use vectorized types like float2 or float4 for faster memory operations if possible
// Verify the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the GPU architecture
// Profile the kernel to identify any stalls or bank conflicts in memory accesses
