```
// Consider using shared memory if possible to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning global memory accesses
// Employ vectorized loads/stores if data alignment permits
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching for overlapping computation with data transfer
// Evaluate thread block size to balance occupancy and SIMD efficiency
