// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Ensure the value is stored in a register to avoid redundant global memory access.
// Test different grid and block sizes to achieve a balance between occupancy and resource utilization.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory if multiple threads require access to common data points.
