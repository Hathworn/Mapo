```
// Use shared memory to cache normalization_factor for reduced global memory access
// Optimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring image and normalization_factor are accessed in a linear pattern
// Prefetch the normalization_factor into a register to minimize latency
