// Minimize index calculations by using registers for frequently accessed values
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Apply loop unrolling for operations within the kernel to enhance re-use of data in registers
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to increase memory throughput
// Use __ldg() for read-only data if running on devices with compute capability >= 3.5 to cache reads
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to match the GPU's architecture for better performance
