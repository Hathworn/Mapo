```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Preload data into registers when possible to reduce latency from global memory access.
// Minimize divergent branches to avoid warp serialization.
// Optimize for bank conflicts in shared memory if employed.
