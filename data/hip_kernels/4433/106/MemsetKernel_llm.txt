// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize use of conditional statements inside kernels to reduce divergent thread execution
// Optimize thread block and grid dimensions for better occupancy based on GPU architecture
