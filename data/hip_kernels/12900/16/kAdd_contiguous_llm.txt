```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize shared memory usage if possible for larger occupancy
// Consider tiling for better shared memory utilization
// Align data structures to avoid memory access penalties
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency
