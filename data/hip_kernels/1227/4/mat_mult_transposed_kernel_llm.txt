// Consider increasing shared memory size if matrix dimensions require more space.
// Optimize memory access by favoring coalesced loads from global memory.
// Avoid unnecessary calculations by leveraging warp-level operations for reduction.
// Utilize the __ldg() intrinsic for read-only global memory access to improve cache usage.
// Care may be needed to ensure all shared memory accesses are within bounds to prevent bank conflicts.
