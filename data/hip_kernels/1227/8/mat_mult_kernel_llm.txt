// Consider coalescing global memory access patterns for mat_a and mat_b
// Use shared memory to store tile data from mat_a and mat_b to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are optimized for your target GPU
// Evaluate using loop unrolling to increase the throughput of the kernel
