```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Unroll the loop to improve throughput and efficiency
// Prefetch data into registers to further reduce latency
// Use tile-based processing to enhance cache reuse
// Ensure memory coalescing for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Maintain warp synchronization to avoid race conditions
