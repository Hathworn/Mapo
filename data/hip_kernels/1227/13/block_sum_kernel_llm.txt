// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced global memory reads in the loop
// Consider adjusting shared memory size based on blockDim.x to utilize memory efficiently
// Use warp-level reduction to minimize __syncthreads overhead
// Prefetch data into shared memory for reduced global memory latency
