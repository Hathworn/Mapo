```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning d_mask, d_dists, and d_update_dists data structures
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block to reduce global memory accesses
// Evaluate thread block size to optimize performance based on device architecture
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring consistent execution paths for all threads within a warp
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency by using asynchronous memory prefetch instructions
```
