```
// Use shared memory to cache matrix fragments to reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput.
// Apply loop unrolling in the inner loop of the multiplication for better performance.
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring thread blocks execute uniformly.
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by selecting optimal block size considering shared memory usage.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by padding the shared memory allocation if needed.
// Use the __restrict__ keyword on pointers to help the compiler with aliasing optimizations.
// Explore the use of prefetching techniques to hide memory latency.
