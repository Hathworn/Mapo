```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing access patterns
// Implement double buffering to hide memory load latency, if applicable
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory for efficiency
// Optimize thread block size to match warp size for maximum occupancy
// Evaluate warp divergence and adjust thread logic if necessary
