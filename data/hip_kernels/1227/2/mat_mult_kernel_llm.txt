```
// Consider using shared memory to store parts of matrix b to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for matrix a and matrix c
// Use loop unrolling to enhance computation efficiency within the loop
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous copy operations to overlap data transfer and computation
