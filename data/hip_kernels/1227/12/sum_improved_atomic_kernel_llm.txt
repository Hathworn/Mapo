```
// Consider coalesced memory access for arr array for improved performance
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access
// Optimize the thread block size for better occupancy and resource utilization
// Ensure proper memory alignment to maximize bandwidth usage
// Minimize the use of atomic operations on global memory
