```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory loads
// Ensure coalesced access pattern for global memory transactions
// Optimize memory access by using memory access patterns that align with warp boundaries
// Explore vectorized operations to leverage higher throughput for memory-bound tasks
```
