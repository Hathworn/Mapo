```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for stencil computation
// Reduce memory divergence by aligning memory accesses to coalesce loads and stores
// Employ warp-synchronous programming when possible to minimize __syncthreads() overhead
// Load halo regions with minimal threads to save resources and ensure efficient data management
// Ensure global memory accesses are within coalesced boundaries for better memory throughput
