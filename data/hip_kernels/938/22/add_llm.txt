// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for num1, num2, and result pointers to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance
// Evaluate if shared memory usage can further optimize memory access
// Minimize conditionals inside the kernel to reduce branching overhead
