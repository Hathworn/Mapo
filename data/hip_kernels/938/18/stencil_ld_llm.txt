// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Add padding in shared memory to avoid out-of-bounds checks and ensure data continuity.
// Load all necessary boundary data into shared memory to minimize repetitive global memory access.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used after loading data into shared memory for synchronization.
