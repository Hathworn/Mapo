// Consider using shared memory for common data that is accessed repeatedly by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Precompute frequently accessed indices and values where possible to minimize repeated calculations.
// Ensure efficient memory access patterns by accessing global memory in coalesced fashion where possible.
// Optimize atomic operations by minimizing their usage and consider using warp-wide operations where applicable.
