```
// Load normalization factor for each thread to maximize memory coalescing
// Use fast approximate reciprocal for division to reduce computation latency
// Ensure all threads within a warp follow the same execution path for efficiency
// Minimize conditional branches to avoid divergent warps
// Store and access image data in a memory-friendly way to enhance cache usage
