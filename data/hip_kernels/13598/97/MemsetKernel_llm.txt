```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if data reuse is possible.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by having consecutive threads access consecutive data elements.
// Minimize the number of memory transactions by optimizing the grid and block dimensions.
// Consider loop unrolling if there are any repeated computation patterns within the kernel.
// Profile the kernel to identify potential memory bottlenecks and address them.
