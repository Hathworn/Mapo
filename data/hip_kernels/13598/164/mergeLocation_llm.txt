```
// Use shared memory to store loc_ data to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced access to loc_ to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider a loop unrolling technique if npoints is large to reduce overhead.
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and reduced memory latency.
// Use warp shuffle for inter-thread communication to decrease synchronization cost.
