```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced global memory access.
// Use shared memory to store d_row_sums for reducing redundant global memory accesses.
// Consider unrolling the loop over n_classes_ for better performance.
// Reduce thread divergence in the conditional feat_col == 0 by restructuring code.
