```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for per_class_sum_.
// Ensure data fits into shared memory; otherwise, consider alternative tiling or memory access strategies.
// Perform boundary checks to avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory, enhancing stability.
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for feature_weights_ to maximize throughput.
