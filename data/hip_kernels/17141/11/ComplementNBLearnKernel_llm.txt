```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Load frequently accessed data into shared memory at the beginning
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used to complete loading data before processing
// Perform boundary check to avoid unnecessary operations
// Reduce memory access within loop to improve efficiency
```
