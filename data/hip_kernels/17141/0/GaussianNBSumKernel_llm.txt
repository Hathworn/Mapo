```
// Consider further optimizing shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Explore the possibility of using warp-level primitives to reduce syncthreads overhead
// Assess if loop unrolling could improve performance during mean calculation
// Investigate if coalesced memory access for d_data[] can be further improved
// Check if atomic operations on shared memory can be avoided to enhance performance
