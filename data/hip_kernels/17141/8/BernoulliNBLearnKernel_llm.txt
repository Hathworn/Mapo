```
// Unroll loop to enhance memory access efficiency and reduce branch divergence
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data layout and access patterns
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for frequently used data
// Cache class_count_ in shared memory for reuse across threads
// Optimize divisions outside the loop to reduce redundant operations
