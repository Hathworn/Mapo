```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory efficiency.
// Optimize the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Align data structures to avoid memory bank conflicts.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations, as they can be a bottleneck.
// Consider using __syncthreads() to ensure proper shared memory synchronization.
// Unroll loops if possible to enhance performance.
