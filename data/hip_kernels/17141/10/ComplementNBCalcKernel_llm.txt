```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access
// Load data into shared memory once, and access it from there
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for reading from d_data
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Avoid divergent branches within warp if possible
// Optimize thread block size to ensure optimal occupancy
