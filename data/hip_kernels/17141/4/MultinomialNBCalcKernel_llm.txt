```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns for d_data and feature_probs
// Consider using shared memory to cache values accessed repeatedly within the loop
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by redesigning data update strategy if possible
// Use warp-level primitives to improve synchronization and reduce global memory access
