```
// Consider using shared memory to cache pixel values and reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency in computation
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by having threads process similar workload
// Leverage arithmetic intensity by doing more computation per memory load
```
