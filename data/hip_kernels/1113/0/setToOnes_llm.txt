// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to maximize bandwidth
// Use loop unrolling to potentially reduce loop overhead
// Evaluate if larger block size benefits occupancy while maintaining coalesced global memory access
