```
// Use shared memory for frequent data accesses to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring proper memory alignment
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for input array 'in' to improve performance
// Explore using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy and memory access patterns
