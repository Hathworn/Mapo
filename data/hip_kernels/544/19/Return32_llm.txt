// Ensure coalesced access to global memory when loading pIn into shared memory
// Consider using a warp-level reduction for atomic operations to minimize contention
// Use larger tile sizes in shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Opt for vectorized loads/stores where possible to improve bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate the potential benefit of using cooperative groups for synchronization
