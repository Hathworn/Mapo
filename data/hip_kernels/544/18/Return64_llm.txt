```
// Suggestion: Minimize atomic operations by performing them outside of loop when possible
// Suggestion: Ensure data alignment for better coalesced memory access
// Suggestion: Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if possible
// Suggestion: Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize atomic usage
// Suggestion: Balance load across threads for efficient memory access patterns
