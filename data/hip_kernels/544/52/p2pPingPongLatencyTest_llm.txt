// Utilize shared memory for common variables to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __threadfence() to prevent stale cache reads and ensure memory consistency
// Update shared variables to prevent redundant global memory assignments
// Use __syncthreads() after updating shared variables to maintain synchronization between threads
