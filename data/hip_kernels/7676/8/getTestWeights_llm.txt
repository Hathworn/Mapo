```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for testImages by using shared memory.
// Use shared memory for restoredEigenvectors to improve memory access efficiency.
// Precompute and store meanImage in shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Evaluate loop unrolling for the inner loop over pixelNum to increase performance.
// Ensure read-after-write dependency is minimized by reordering calculations if applicable.
