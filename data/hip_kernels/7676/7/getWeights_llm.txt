```
// Use shared memory to cache parts of restoredEigenvectors for better memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for the for-loop to reduce loop overhead
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Minimize global memory accesses by using registers for frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for meanSubtractedImages
// Consider using texture memory for meanSubtractedImages if it's accessed randomly
