// Use shared memory to cache data per block for faster access  
// Optimize thread synchronization to reduce overhead  
// Consider using warp shuffles for data exchange between threads for reducing shared memory usage  
// Pre-fetch data to shared memory before they're needed to minimize global memory latency
