```
// Consider using shared memory for reducedEigenvectors to reduce global memory access
// Use loop unrolling to optimize the loop calculation
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when accessing meanSubtractedImages
// Preload data to registers where possible to reduce repeated global memory access
// Align data structures to memory boundaries for better memory access efficiency
