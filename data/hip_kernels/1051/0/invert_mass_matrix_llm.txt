```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve compiler optimizations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing the input data layout appropriately.
// Use shared memory if data reuse within the block is possible to reduce global memory transactions.
// Evaluate if occupancy improvements are achieved by adjusting block size and grid size.
// Profile the kernel to identify if memory latency is a bottleneck and opt for further memory hierarchy optimizations.
