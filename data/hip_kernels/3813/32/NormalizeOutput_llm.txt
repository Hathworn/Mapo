// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated accesses to data
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory and optimize accordingly
// Align data structures to ensure optimal use of memory bandwidth
// Minimize use of atomic operations if possible to reduce serialization
