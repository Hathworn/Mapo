```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory array size matches workload requirements
// Consider aligning memory accesses for coalescing
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Cache intermediate results in registers to reduce memory traffic
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Optimize loop unrolling factor based on kernel performance analysis
