```cpp
// Utilize coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Ensure enough blocks are used to fully utilize the GPU's computing resources
// Use asynchronous memory operations to overlap data transfer and computation
