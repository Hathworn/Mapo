// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for devValue and devWeight.
// Use coalesced memory access to optimize the pattern of memory reads.
// Implement loop unrolling where applicable to minimize loop overhead.
// Consider using atomic operations to safely handle concurrent updates to shared variables.
// Minimize block divergence by ensuring all threads in a block follow similar execution paths.
// Use local memory for temporary variables that do not need to be shared across threads.
