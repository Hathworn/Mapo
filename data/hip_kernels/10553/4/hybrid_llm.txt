```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as devValue and devWeight to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for cudaChromo and cudaNewpopulation to increase memory throughput.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to optimize kernel performance and minimize warp divergence.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergence in simple conditional operations where applicable.
// Consider using unified memory to simplify memory management and reduce data transfer overheads.
