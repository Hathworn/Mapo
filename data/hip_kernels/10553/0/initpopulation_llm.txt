```
// Consider increasing the workload per thread to reduce kernel launch overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by processing continuous memory locations.
// Explore using shared memory for commonly accessed data to minimize global memory access.
// Investigate using the __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to improve compiler optimizations.
// Analyze the impact of varying the block size and grid size for better hardware utilization.
// Evaluate using memory prefetching techniques to hide memory latency.
