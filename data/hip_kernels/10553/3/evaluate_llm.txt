// Use shared memory to cache devValue and devWeight for faster access
// Avoid bank conflicts by arranging shared memory accesses appropriately
// Try double-buffering technique to overlap memory transfers and computation
// Consider using atomic operations if there are concurrent writes to the same memory location
