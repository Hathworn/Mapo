```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for improved performance
// Ensure aligned memory accesses by using appropriate data structures
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic where possible
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into registers if beneficial for repeated computations
