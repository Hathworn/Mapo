```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures appropriately
// Consider using shared memory to cache red, green, and blue values for better bandwidth utilization
// Use loop unrolling if there is potential for further unrolling beyond the current implementation
// Verify if launch configurations (block and grid sizes) are optimal for the specific GPU hardware
// Evaluate if using texture memory would benefit access patterns for red, green, and blue arrays
