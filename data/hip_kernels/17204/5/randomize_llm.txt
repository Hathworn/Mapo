// Minimize global memory access by caching in registers
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring thread accesses are coalesced
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for faster access
// Use __syncthreads() if required to prevent race conditions with rand states
// Consider launching occupancy calculator tool for best block-size
