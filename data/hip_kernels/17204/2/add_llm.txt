// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures optimally
// Investigate loop unrolling for minimal loop overhead and improved performance
// Evaluate using pinned memory for faster host-device memory transfer
// Profile the kernel to identify specific bottlenecks and optimize accordingly
