```
// Use shared memory to temporarily store data and reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for gradOutput_data and gradInput_data.
// Minimize divergence within warp by aligning the loop and addressing structures.
// Prefetch data to shared memory in a coalesced manner to improve memory access patterns.
// Align kernel execution configuration with data layout for optimal memory throughput.
