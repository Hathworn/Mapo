// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Minimize use of shared memory when possible to reduce bank conflicts
// Align data structures to warp memory boundary for optimal memory throughput
// Use local variables when possible to reduce register pressure
