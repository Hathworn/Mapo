```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns when loading energy into shared_row_energy to reduce memory latency.
// Optimize shared memory utilization by minimizing bank conflicts during parallel access by threads.
// Consider using a different thread block size for better occupancy and shared memory usage efficiency.
// Minimize synchronization overhead by organizing  computations to use fewer __syncthreads() calls when possible.
