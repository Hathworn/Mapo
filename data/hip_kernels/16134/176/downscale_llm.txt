```
// Precompute frequently used values and store them in registers for faster access
// Use __forceinline__ to suggest function inlining and reduce function call overhead
// Accumulate results in registers to minimize global memory access
// Store computed results to global memory once to reduce the number of writes
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage if applicable to further reduce latency
