```cpp
// Use shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for higher computational throughput
// Use __restrict__ pointers for potential compiler optimizations in memory accesses
// Reduce the use of if conditions inside kernels for better performance
```
