```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize index calculations to reduce redundant operations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Reuse precomputed multipliers to avoid recalculating in each iteration.
// Consider loop unrolling for the ox and oy loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Balance block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Align data structures to cache line sizes to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use vectorized types (e.g., float4) where possible to improve bandwidth utilization.
