```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring global memory accesses are in contiguous memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Minimize divergent branches in the warp by restructuring conditional logic if possible.
// Investigate the use of vectorized operations for potential speedup.
// Ensure the occupancy is maximized by choosing an appropriate block size or using occupancy calculator tools.
// Consider allocating memory aligned to cache line boundaries to improve cache performance.
