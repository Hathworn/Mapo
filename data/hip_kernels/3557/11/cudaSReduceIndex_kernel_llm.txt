```
// Consider reducing shared memory usage to improve performance
// Use more registers for frequently accessed variables to minimize memory latency
// Ensure memory alignment for input and output data to maximize coalesced memory access
// Evaluate using texture memory or constant memory for valueThreshold if it doesn't change often
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal kernel performance
// Minimize conditional branching within the kernel to increase warp efficiency
