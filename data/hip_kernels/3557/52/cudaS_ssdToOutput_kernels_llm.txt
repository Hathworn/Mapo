```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for roi_bbox and outputs.
// Ensure roi_bbox accesses are as contiguous as possible for adjacent threads.
// Avoid redundant calculation by storing reused results in local variables.
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries when possible for better efficiency.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if applicable.
// Minimize the number of separate accesses to global memory by grouping read operations.
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration for maximum warps efficiency.
// Reduce the number of divergent branches within warps.
// Utilize constant memory for any inputs that remain unchanged across threadblocks.
