```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for repeated values
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for loading diffInput
// Avoid atomic operations if possible by restructuring computation
// Preload constants calculated per-thread to avoid redundant computation
// Use loop unrolling pragmatically where beneficial for performance and readability
