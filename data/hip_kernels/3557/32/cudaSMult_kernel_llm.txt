// Use shared memory more efficiently by reducing bank conflicts.
// Consider using loop unrolling to increase performance.
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing global memory reads and writes.
// If possible, minimize the use of __syncthreads() to avoid performance penalties.
// Ensure data alignment for improved memory access speeds.
