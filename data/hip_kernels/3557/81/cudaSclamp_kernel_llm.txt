```
// Consider coalescing memory access for better performance
// Use shared memory to store data that is accessed multiple times
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve efficiency
// Use a vectorized type if possible to process multiple elements at once
