```
// Optimize memory coalescing for global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by using padding if necessary
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Evaluate the balance between shared memory size and occupancy for this kernel
// Use __restrict__ keyword on pointers if applicable to enable better compiler optimizations
// Assess whether further optimization of block size and grid size can improve performance
