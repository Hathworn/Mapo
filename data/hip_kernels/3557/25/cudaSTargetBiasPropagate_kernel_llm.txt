// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable compiler optimizations
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed inputs or diffInputs
// Access memory in coalesced fashion to minimize latency
// Explore using warp-level primitives for reduction where applicable
// Ensure memory alignment for float to reduce unaligned access penalties
