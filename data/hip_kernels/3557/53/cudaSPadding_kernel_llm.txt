```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for inputs and outputs to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory if possible to store data being accessed multiple times by threads within the same block
// Ensure threads read consecutive memory locations to increase memory coalescing
// Minimize branch divergence by rearranging conditional code if possible
// Optimize data reuse by exploring loop unrolling techniques
// Utilize constant memory for any constants used frequently across threads
// Consider adjusting block and grid dimensions to better utilize GPU resources and reduce idle threads
