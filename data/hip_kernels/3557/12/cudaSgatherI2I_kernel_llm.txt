```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use loop unrolling if the number of iterations is known and small
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and efficiency
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
