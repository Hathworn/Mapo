```
// Use shared memory for faster access to frequently reused data
// Prefer coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory transactions
// Reduce the number of accesses to global memory by using shared memory
// Ensure shared memory bank conflicts are minimized when accessing shared_data
// Allocate shared memory considering the optimal size based on the warp size
