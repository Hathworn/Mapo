// Implement warp-level reductions to minimize shared memory usage
// Use atomic operations for final reduction step to ensure correctness
// Consider using loop unrolling for improving performance
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning global memory accesses
// Reduce register usage by minimizing local variables
