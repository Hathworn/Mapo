```
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently reused data.
// Minimize divergent branches within warps.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for efficient memory access.
// Experiment with loop unrolling for small fixed-size loops.
// Consider splitting the kernel if occupancy is low due to high register usage.
// Use constant memory for read-only static data that is accessed by all threads.
// Analyze warp occupancy and balance computation and memory operations.
