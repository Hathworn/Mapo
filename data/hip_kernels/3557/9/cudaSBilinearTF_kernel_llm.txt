```
// Consider using shared memory to cache xLowIdx, xHighIdx, yLowIdx, yHighIdx, xInter, yInter for better memory access patterns
// Ensure alignment to memory boundaries by padding structures if necessary
// Try adjusting block and grid dimensions to optimize device occupancy
// Use warp-level primitives to maximize use of the GPU hardware
// Avoid bank conflicts by organizing data access to shared memory
