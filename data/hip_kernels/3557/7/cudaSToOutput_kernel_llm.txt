```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for inputs and outputs to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Investigate using shared memory for frequently accessed data like numPartsPerClass and numTemplatesPerClass.
// Minimize redundant calculation in conditions to streamline execution.
// Use constant or __restrict__ pointers for data that doesn't change to optimize cache hit rates.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for small fixed-size loops to reduce overhead and improve throughput.
// Check alignment of inputs and outputs for better efficiency in memory transactions.
// Profile memory footprint impact and data dependencies to synchronize threads effectively.
