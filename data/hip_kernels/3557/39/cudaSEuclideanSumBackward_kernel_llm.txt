```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure thread divergence is minimized by replacing conditional operations with arithmetic calculations
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// If possible, use vectorized data types (like float2 or float4) to load/store multiple values simultaneously
