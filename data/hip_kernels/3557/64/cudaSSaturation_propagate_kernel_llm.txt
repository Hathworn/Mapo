```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and minimize global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access for x and y to improve memory throughput.
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path where possible.
// Try adjusting block and grid sizes to find the most efficient configuration for the hardware used.
