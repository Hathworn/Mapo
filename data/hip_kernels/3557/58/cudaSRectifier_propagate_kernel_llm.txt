// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if applicable
// Consider adjusting block size and grid size for optimal occupancy
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous data
// Try avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory if shared memory is used
// Analyze memory access patterns to ensure optimal use of caches
