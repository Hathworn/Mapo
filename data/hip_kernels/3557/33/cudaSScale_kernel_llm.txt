```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Unroll the loop to increase instruction-level parallelism and optimize performance
// Consider using vectorized memory access if appropriate
// Ensure proper occupancy by selecting optimal block size and grid size
