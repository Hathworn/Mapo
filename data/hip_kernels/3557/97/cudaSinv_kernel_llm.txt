```
// Optimize: Use shared memory for faster access
// Optimize: Reduce global memory accesses by leveraging shared memory
// Optimize: Avoid warp divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Optimize: Balance work across threads to utilize full GPU resources effectively
// Optimize: Consider using loop unrolling for better performance if iterations are known and manageable
