```
// Use shared memory to store data chunks reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to enhance memory throughput.
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and improve performance.
// Investigate the use of vectorized loads/stores to further optimize memory transactions.
// Assess the necessity of __syncthreads() for synchronizing shared memory access if introduced.
