```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Evaluate coalesced memory access for improved bandwidth
// Optimize loop unrolling factor based on the specific hardware architecture
// Adjust grid and block size for better occupancy and throughput
// Prefetch data where possible to hide memory latency
// Ensure memory alignment for better memory access efficiency
