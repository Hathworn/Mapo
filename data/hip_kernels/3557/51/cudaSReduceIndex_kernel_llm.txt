```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to avoid redundant global memory accesses
// Assess if occupancy is optimal and adjust block size or grid size accordingly
// Analyze the possibility of loop unrolling for performance improvements
// Review if valueThreshold can be cached in registers to reduce access time
