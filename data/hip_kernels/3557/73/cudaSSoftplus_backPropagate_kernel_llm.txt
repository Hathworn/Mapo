```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for coalesced access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used appropriately to prevent race conditions
// Adjust shared memory size based on thread block size for efficient usage
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to prevent unnecessary synchronization overhead
