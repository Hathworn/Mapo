```
// Ensure proper memory coalescing by accessing global memory with aligned accesses
// Consider using shared memory to store partsPrediction and partsVisibilityPrediction data to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Utilize warp-level primitives to optimize parts and templates processing within the thread block
// Evaluate use of texture memory for better caching behavior when accessing ROIEst and partsPrediction
// Minimize conditionals by pre-computing output indices outside of the kernel if possible
// Apply loop unrolling technique to optimize parts and templates iteration where applicable
