```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by aligning shared memory loading pattern
// Use a loop to load shared memory to handle cases where thread block size exceeds shared memory size
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed 48KB for optimal performance on most hardware
// Minimize divergence within warps by ensuring conditional branches are minimized
// Consider using texture memory for invariant input data to benefit from cache locality
// Optimize the number of registers used per thread to prevent spilling to local memory
