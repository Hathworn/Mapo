```
// Use shared memory for batchInputOffset calculations to reduce global memory access
// Apply loop unrolling when nbClass is a small fixed value to reduce loop overhead
// Consider using atomic operations if multiple threads write to outputEstimated at once
// Prefetch data to registers before the loop to decrease memory latency
