```
// Consider utilizing coalesced memory access patterns for input, sign, and result arrays
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper padding
// Ensure that shared memory usage is within limits to prevent potential performance degradation
// Evaluate the grid and block dimensions to maximize warp occupancy
// Investigate the potential benefits of using __ldg() for readonly data like sign
// Assess if loop unrolling can provide performance improvements
// Investigate if using atomic operations can reduce the need for synchronization
