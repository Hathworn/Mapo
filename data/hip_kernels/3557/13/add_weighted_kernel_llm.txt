// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory to cache estimated_labels and reduce global memory accesses.
// Use texture memory for read-only data that is accessed multiple times for better cache efficiency.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources and minimize warp divergence.
