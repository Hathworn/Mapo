```cpp
// Consider using shared memory only when multiple accesses per element are needed
// Ensure shared memory is correctly sized to avoid conflicts
// Minimize global memory accesses by reducing the number of load/store operations
// Prioritize coalesced memory accesses to improve memory utilization
// Experiment with block size and grid size for optimal performance
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary usage when data dependency is not present
