// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure coalesced reads.
// Ensure proper alignment when accessing memory to improve throughput.
// Assess whether using texture or surface memory can provide additional benefits.
// Try minimizing divergent branches for better warp efficiency.
