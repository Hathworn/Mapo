```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_M by sequential reads
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_N by sequential reads
// Make use of shared memory for temporary data storage to reduce bandwidth
// Synchronize threads to ensure consistent reads after loading into shared memory
// Optimize block size to improve occupancy and reduce idle threads
// Optimize tile size to balance between shared memory space and computation efficiency
