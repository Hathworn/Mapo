```
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate pixel values
// Optimize memory access by ensuring aligned access patterns
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed constants like maxLum
// Minimize global memory access by reusing computed pixel index
// Leverage warp-level primitives to reduce divergent branches
