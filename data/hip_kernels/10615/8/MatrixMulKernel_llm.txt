// Unroll loop to improve instruction throughput
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions
// Only write back to global memory if indices are within matrix bounds to avoid unnecessary operations
// Enhance memory access patterns by coalescing global memory reads and writes
