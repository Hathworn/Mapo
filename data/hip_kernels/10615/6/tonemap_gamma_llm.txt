```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where applicable.
// Consider loop unrolling if computationally beneficial.
// Ensure data alignment for better memory throughput.
// Minimize the use of branches inside the kernel for efficiency.
// Profile the kernel execution to identify bottlenecks.
