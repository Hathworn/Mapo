```
// Consider coalesced access by ensuring threads in a warp access consecutive memory addresses
// Use shared memory to cache image data for improved memory access performance
// Minimize global memory access by using registers for temporary variables
// Apply loop unrolling techniques if applicable for better memory throughput
