```
// Consider using coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations.
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, enhancing memory access efficiency.
// Implement warp shuffle operations for intrawarp communication in place of shared memory usage for reduction.
// Use __syncthreads() wisely only when necessary to minimize performance overhead.
// Use atomic operations efficiently to avoid excessive serialization among threads.
