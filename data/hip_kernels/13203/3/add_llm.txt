// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.  
// Minimize the use of global variables inside kernel functions as registers are faster.  
// Optimize block and grid sizes to achieve maximum occupancy and efficient hardware use.  
// Benchmark different memory access patterns to identify the most efficient usage.  
// Consider using memory coalescing by aligning memory access to warp size for optimal bandwidth.  
// Profile memory usage to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
