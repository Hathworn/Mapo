// Ensure coalesced memory access by using global stride loop
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize register pressure by limiting the number of variables in the kernel
// Use appropriate block and grid size to maximize GPU occupancy
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory by proper indexing
