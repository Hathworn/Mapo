```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance
// Ensure INCX is 1 to achieve optimal memory access patterns
// Use shared memory if the kernel operation is bandwidth-bound for better efficiency
// Evaluate if memory access patterns can be improved for better caching
// Check occupancy and adjust shared memory and block size to maximize it
