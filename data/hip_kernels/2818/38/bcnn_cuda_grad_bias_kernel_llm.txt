```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access latency
// Align memory access to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Utilize warp-level primitives to further optimize the reduction
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target GPU
// Explore using tensor cores for further performance improvement
