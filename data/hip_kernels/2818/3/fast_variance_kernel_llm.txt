// Consider using memory coalescing by ensuring accesses are contiguous for better performance.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing redundant memory accesses.
// Implement warp-level reductions to enhance efficiency in block reduction.
// Utilize asynchronous copy functions for data transfer between global and shared memory when possible.
