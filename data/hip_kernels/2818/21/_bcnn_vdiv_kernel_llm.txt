```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing consecutive elements in arrays a, b, and y
// Consider using shared memory if elements are accessed multiple times to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory throughput
