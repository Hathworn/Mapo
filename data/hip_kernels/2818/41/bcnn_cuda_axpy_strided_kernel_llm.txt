```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Implement loop unrolling for kernel iterations to reduce instruction overhead.
// Use a higher thread block size to improve occupancy and reduce divergence.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Investigate the use of asynchronous memory operations and streams.
