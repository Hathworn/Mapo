```
// Use shared memory to optimize data access from global memory, reducing latency
// Minimize redundant calculations by precomputing repeated expressions
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to increase performance
// Align memory access to coalesce global memory transactions
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only variables like stride and pad
// Consider texture memory for read-only input data to utilize texture cache
