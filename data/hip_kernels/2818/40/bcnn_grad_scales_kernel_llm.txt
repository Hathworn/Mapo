```c
// Unroll the inner loop to maximize instruction throughput and reduce loop overhead.
// Use parallel reduction to efficiently accumulate the sum within the shared memory.
// Ensure the memory access pattern is coalesced for optimal read and write operations.
// Add potential double-buffering strategy to hide memory latency.
