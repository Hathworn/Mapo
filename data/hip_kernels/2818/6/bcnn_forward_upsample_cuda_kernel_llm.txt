```cpp
// Ensure threads are fully utilized by optimizing block and grid dimensions
// Precompute and cache repeated operations to enhance computational efficiency
// Utilize memory coalescing by accessing src and dst arrays in a coalesced manner
// Avoid redundant boundary checks by using a carefully calculated grid size
// Implement shared memory usage if beneficial to cache frequently accessed data
```
