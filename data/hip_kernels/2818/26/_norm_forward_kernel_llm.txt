```
// Consider using shared memory to store mean and variance values to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing when accessing array 'x' to optimize bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize loop increment by using 'idx += blockDim.x * gridDim.x' for grid-stride loop.
// Reduce divergent branches by ensuring 'j' is computed outside of heavily iterated loops when possible.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to further enhance throughput for the normalization calculations.
// Utilize asynchronous copies to preload 'mean' and 'variance' if memory patterns allow to overlap computation and data transfer.
// Evaluate the occupancy and thread-block size for optimal GPU utilization.
