// Consider using shared memory for weight_data to reduce global memory access latency
// Use memory coalescing techniques for src_grad and dst_grad access to improve memory throughput
// Optimize thread block size to utilize GPU resources better while maintaining high occupancy
// Ensure alignment of data structures in memory for efficient memory access patterns
