```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access for x array
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to further reduce global memory latency
// Use warp-level reduction to reduce shared memory bank conflicts
// Ensure that stride over spatial dimension results in minimal bank conflicts
```
