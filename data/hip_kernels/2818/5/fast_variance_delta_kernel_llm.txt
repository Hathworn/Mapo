```
// Minimize shared memory usage by reducing the size of local array
// Loop unrolling could improve performance in iteration where id varies
// Use warp shuffle for faster reduction instead of shared memory
// Avoid unnecessary global memory accesses by caching x and delta
// Prefetch data into registers to hide global memory latency
// Consider using cooperative groups for more complex reduction patterns
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced
```
