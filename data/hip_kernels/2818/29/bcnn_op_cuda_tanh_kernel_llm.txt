```
// Ensure memory alignment for better performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword to prevent pointer aliasing
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize global memory access by using registers
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency
// Reduce divergence by ensuring uniform work distribution
