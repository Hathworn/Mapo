```
// Consider using shared memory for d_A block to reduce global memory accesses
// Rearrange loops to improve coalesced memory access patterns
// Explore increasing numThreadsPerBlock to the warp size to improve parallelism
// Minimize usage of sqrtf by computing 1/sigma and multiplying
// Use __syncthreads() if shared memory is implemented to ensure consistency
