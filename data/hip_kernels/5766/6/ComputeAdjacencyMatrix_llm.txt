```
// Consider using shared memory to cache nnCol values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate if coalesced memory access can be further optimized for dOut updates.
// Leverage loop unrolling to potentially improve performance within the loop.
// Address potential memory alignment issues for nn and dOut for better memory throughput.
