// Consider increasing the block size for better memory coalescing
// Use vector loads and stores to improve memory throughput
// Leverage warp shuffle operations for reductions within warps
// Ensure data fits within shared memory limits by optimizing block size
// Align data accesses to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Implement double buffering in shared memory to overlap computation and memory access
