```
// Reduce global memory accesses by using shared memory for sorting.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous access patterns.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize memory latency.
// Avoid branch divergence within the sorting loop.
// Align data structures to reduce memory access overhead.
