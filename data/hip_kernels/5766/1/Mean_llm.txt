// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for dIn and dMeanIn to improve loading efficiency.
// Use shared memory strategically to reduce redundant loads from global memory.
// Ensure atomic operations are correctly used to avoid race conditions when updating shared memory.
// Optimize use of shared memory by padding to avoid bank conflicts during concurrent accesses.
