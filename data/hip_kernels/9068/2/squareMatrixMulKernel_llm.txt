```
// Consider using shared memory to cache rows of matrix A and columns of matrix B to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the loop by unrolling if arrayWidth is known and small.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointer parameters to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy, depending on GPU architecture.
