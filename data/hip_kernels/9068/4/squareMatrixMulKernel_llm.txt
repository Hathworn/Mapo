```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses when loading tiles into shared memory.
// Optimize shared memory usage by carefully placing __syncthreads() to minimize stalls.
// Ensure that all threads have completed computation before moving to the next tile.
// Profile kernel execution to determine if further loop unrolling can benefit performance.
// Adjust TILE_SIZE for optimal occupancy based on target GPU architecture.
