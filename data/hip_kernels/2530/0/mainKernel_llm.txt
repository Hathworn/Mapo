```
// Use early return to minimize unnecessary computation
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory if threads within the block require frequent data reuse
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning data structures to memory boundaries
// Explore occupancy to ensure high utilization of the GPU cores
