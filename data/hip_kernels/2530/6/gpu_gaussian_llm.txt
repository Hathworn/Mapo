// Suggest using loop unrolling in cpu_applyFilter to reduce loop overhead.
// Consider coalesced memory access in gpu_gaussian for image array reads and writes.
// Use shared memory efficiently by loading blocks in a coalesced manner.
// Preload constants (e.g., filter weights) into registers for faster access.
// Optimize thread allocation to minimize warp divergences.
