```cpp
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy and throughput
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory access for overlapping sub-regions
// Ensure coalesced memory access in loading input data to shared memory
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by properly aligning data
// Consider double buffering shared memory for improved data overlap
// Optimize synchronization to minimize warp divergence and improve performance
