```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data
// Utilize vectorized memory access patterns to improve data throughput
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring that consecutive threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring warp threads execute the same path
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring accesses are to different banks
