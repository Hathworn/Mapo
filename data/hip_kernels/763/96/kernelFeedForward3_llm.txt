```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory transactions
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Prefetch data where possible to overlap memory access latency with computation
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and memory throughput
```
