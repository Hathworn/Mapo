```c
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by aligning threads' access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead
// Ensure output array size is a power of two to use bitwise operations for performance
```
