// Consider using shared memory for Layer4_Neurons_GPU data to reduce memory access latency.
// Experiment with adjusting the unroll factor to find the balance between computational efficiency and register usage.
// Use cached memory access (__ldg) for both Layer4_Neurons_GPU and Layer4_Weights_GPU for faster reads.
