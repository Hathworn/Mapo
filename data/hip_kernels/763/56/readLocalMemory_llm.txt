```
// Use coalesced memory access for better memory performance.
// Ensure enough shared memory to avoid memory bank conflicts.
// Unroll loops to reduce control overhead and improve performance.
// Align shared memory usage to optimize for warp efficiency.
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data in shared memory.
