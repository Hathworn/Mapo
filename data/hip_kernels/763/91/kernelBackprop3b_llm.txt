```
// Load zs into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded zs into shared memory
// Calculate the sigmoid once and reuse to avoid redundant calculations
// Utilize shared memory for storing intermediate values to improve memory access speed
// Minimize use of global memory access by operating on data in shared memory
