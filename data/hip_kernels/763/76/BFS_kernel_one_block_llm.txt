```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for the frontier and visited arrays
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like edgeArray and edgeArrayAux
// Minimize redundant global memory accesses by reusing loaded data within the loop
// Optimize the use of atomic operations to reduce contention and synchronization overhead
// Ensure that data is read in a coalesced manner by aligning thread accesses properly
