// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory access speed.
// Minimize atomic operations as they can cause serialization and decrease performance.
// Employ cooperative thread mapping to balance workload and improve cache utilization.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures for efficient access by threads.
