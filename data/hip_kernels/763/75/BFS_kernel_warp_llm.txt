```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for 'levels', 'edgeArray', and 'edgeArrayAux'.
// Use shared memory to buffer frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize warp divergence by ensuring all lanes complete tasks concurrently, without branching.
// Use __shfl_sync or similar functions to share data between threads within a warp.
// Reduce redundant memory accesses by caching vertex edge indices when possible.
// Consider splitting large memory accesses into smaller coalesced accesses for improved throughput.
