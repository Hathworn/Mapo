```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'edgeArray' to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Utilize shared memory to cache 'edgeArrayAux' to decrease global memory access latency.
// Use loop unrolling for the neighbors iteration to optimize the performance of small loops.
// Implement warp-level primitives to minimize atomic operations on 'frontier_length'.
// Leverage asynchronous memory prefetching to reduce latency in loading 'frontier' elements.
