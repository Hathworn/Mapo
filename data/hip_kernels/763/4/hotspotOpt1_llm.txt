// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed values
// Consider memory coalescing by aligning data accesses with warp size
// Minimize register pressure by reducing the number of temporary variables
// Use loop unrolling for the 'for' loop to reduce overhead
// Prefetch data to registers outside of the loop for better memory access patterns
// Evaluate if reducing precision could lead to performance improvements without significant accuracy loss
