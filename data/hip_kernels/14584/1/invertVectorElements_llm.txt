```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and performance
// Assess usage of float vs. double precision based on required accuracy and performance trade-offs
