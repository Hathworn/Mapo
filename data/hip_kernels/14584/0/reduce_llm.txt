```
// Consider loading data in coalesced access patterns for better memory usage.
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts during reduction.
// Unroll loops to increase throughput and reduce computation time.
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads to safely share data among threads.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning accesses and reducing stride.
// Use volatile qualifier wisely to prevent compiler optimizations which may affect shared memory results.
