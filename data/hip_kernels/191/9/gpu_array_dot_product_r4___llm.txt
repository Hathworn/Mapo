// Use float4 vector data types for arr1 and arr2 to increase memory throughput.
// Align tsize to a multiple of warp size to ensure full utilization of hardware.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency and hide memory access time.
// Optimize reduction by using warp-level primitives such as __shfl_xor_sync.
