// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements.
// Consider using shared memory if the array value is used repeatedly by multiple threads.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy.
// Align memory allocations to ensure optimal memory access patterns.
