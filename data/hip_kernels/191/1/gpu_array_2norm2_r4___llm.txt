```
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce shared memory usage for accumulating results
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access for the array elements
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() if warp shuffle is used for reduction
// Ensure stride access for arr[i] into thread executes with minimized memory transfer overhead
