// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by aligning data for better coalescing
// Use memory access strategies like read-only cache for input arrays if applicable
// Evaluate potential benefits of using atomic operations and reduce their overhead
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to minimize data transfer between global and local memory
