// Use shared memory to cache values for reuse, reducing global memory accesses.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data, which can be faster than global memory.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to achieve maximum occupancy.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structure to 128 bytes.
