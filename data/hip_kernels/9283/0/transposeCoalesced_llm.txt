```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Align shared memory to avoid bank conflicts (+1 added to TILE_DIM).
// Ensure coalesced global memory access while loading and storing data.
// Experiment with different TILE_DIM and BLOCK_ROWS values for better performance.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory.
