```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for matrix and vector reads to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Ensure shared memory usage efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Evaluate the impact of using warp shuffle functions for reduction, which can reduce the need for shared memory synchronization.
// Optimize memory access by using texture or surface memory if applicable for read-only data like the vector.
