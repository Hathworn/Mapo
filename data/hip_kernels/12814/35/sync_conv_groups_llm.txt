```
// Use shared memory when possible to optimize memory access patterns.
// Aim to coalesce global memory accesses to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Consider using warp shuffle functions to reduce shared memory use.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid bank conflicts.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization to reduce latency.
