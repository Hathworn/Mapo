```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput
// Minimize the use of global memory by employing shared memory when possible
// Ensure memory access is aligned to prevent performance penalties
// Evaluate the use of asynchronized memory prefetching to hide latency
// Explore vectorized operations for improving SIMD utilization
// Use constant memory if input data is read-only and frequently accessed
