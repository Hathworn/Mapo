```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns.
// Optimize the grid and block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Avoid divergence in the loop by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
