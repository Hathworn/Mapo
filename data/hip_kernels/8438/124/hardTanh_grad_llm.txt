// Use shared memory to cache out_d values to reduce global memory reads.
// Consider tuning the block size to ensure shared memory fits the block.
// Use loop unrolling to increase throughput and minimize loop overhead.
// Ensure blockDim.x is configured appropriately to fully utilize shared memory.
