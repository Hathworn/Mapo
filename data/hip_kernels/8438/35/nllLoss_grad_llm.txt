```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize atomic operations where possible as they can create bottlenecks
// Verify that data is correctly aligned for optimal access speeds
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimal for the GPU architecture being used
