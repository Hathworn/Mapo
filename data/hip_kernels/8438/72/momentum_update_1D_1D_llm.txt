```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for x, d, and m arrays.
// Align data on 128-byte boundaries to optimize for memory transactions.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniformity in conditional execution paths.
// Assess if vectorized loads can be applied for further memory throughput enhancement.
