```
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are configured to maximize occupancy
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler with optimizations
// Prefetch data into shared memory if further optimizations are needed
// Consider using warp-level primitives for intra-warp communication if applicable
// Align data access to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
