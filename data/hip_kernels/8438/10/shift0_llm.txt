// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for faster access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to be coalesced for GPU efficiency.
// Ensure that each thread accesses contiguous memory locations to maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Look into adjusting block and grid sizes to better fit the hardware's capabilities.
