```
// Use coalesced memory access for x, d, and m arrays
// Ensure arrays are aligned for better memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables like temp
// Use loop unrolling for the while loop to improve performance
// Optimize for memory bottleneck by reducing the number of global memory accesses
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized in conditions like gradient clipping checks
