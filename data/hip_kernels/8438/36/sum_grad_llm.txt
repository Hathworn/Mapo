```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to reduce repeated global memory reads
// Align memory accesses to coalesce global memory operations
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop control overhead
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy and bandwidth utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring memory accesses are aligned
```
