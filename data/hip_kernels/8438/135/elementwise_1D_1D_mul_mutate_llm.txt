```c
// Use shared memory for in1 and in2 to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory throughput.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to 4-byte boundaries for optimal performance.
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop to enhance warp efficiency.
// Balance the number of warps per multiprocessor to achieve maximum occupancy.
