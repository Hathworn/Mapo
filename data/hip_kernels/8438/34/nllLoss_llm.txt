```
// Use shared memory to store input data and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures
// Minimize the memory footprint in kernels to improve memory throughput
// Consider the use of vectorized loads and stores if applicable
// Ensure warp-divergence-free condition by aligning data indices correctly
