```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access by each thread
// Experiment with different block sizes to achieve better performance
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned
// Use __restrict__ qualifier if pointers do not alias to help the compiler optimize
```
