```
// Use shared memory for coalesced access to avoid global memory access bottlenecks
// Prefetch data where possible to hide memory latency
// Use vectorized loads/stores if the data is appropriately aligned for increased bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
