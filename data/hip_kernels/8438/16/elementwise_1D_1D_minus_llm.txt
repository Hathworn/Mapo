```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory throughput
// Ensure that threadIdx.x is the fastest varying index for better memory access
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that all threads in a warp execute the same instructions
// Prefetch data into local registers to reduce global memory latency
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data if there is temporal reuse
// Balance the number of blocks and threads to maximize occupancy
