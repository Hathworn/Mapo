```
// Consider coalescing global memory access to enhance performance
// Avoid redundant synchronization to reduce overhead
// Minimize shared memory usage by using registers where possible
// Balance the number of threads per block to optimize grid configuration
// Use asynchronous memory copy operations if applicable for overlapping computation and data transfer
