// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Explore loop unrolling further based on typical input sizes
// Evaluate if prefetching data to L1 or L2 cache improves performance
// Investigate concurrent kernel launches if possible to hide latency
