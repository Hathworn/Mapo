// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures to warp size
// Consider using shared memory for repeated calculations within a block
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp efficiency
// Utilize constant memory for any repetitive read-only data
// Restructure data access patterns to favor sequential access for better caching
// Assess register pressure and optimize thread-level memory usage
