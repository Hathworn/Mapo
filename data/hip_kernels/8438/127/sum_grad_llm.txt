```c
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to 'out' values to reduce global memory access.
// Align data structures to ensure coalesced memory access when reading from 'in' and writing to 'out'.
// Use vectorized loads and stores if possible for accessing 'in' and 'out' arrays.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by restructuring data access patterns, if applicable.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could reduce computation and loop overhead for the 'for' loop.
