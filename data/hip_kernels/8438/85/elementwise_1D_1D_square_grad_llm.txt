```
// Use memory coalescing for in_d and out_d by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Prefetch data to shared memory if accessed multiple times within the kernel
// Consider tiling the loop to exploit spatial locality and improve cache usage
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce redundant calculations
// Double-check thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp progress similarly
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions for better workload distribution and load balancing
