// Use shared memory or cache for frequently accessed data to improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Minimize conditional operations if possible to reduce thread divergence.
// Optimize stride access pattern to maintain memory coalescing.
