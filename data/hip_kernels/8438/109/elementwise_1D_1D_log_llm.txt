```cpp
// Use shared memory for better memory access patterns
// Coalesce memory accesses for increased bandwidth utilization
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations for overlapping kernel execution with data transfers
// Optimize block size to fully utilize GPU resources and maximize occupancy
```
