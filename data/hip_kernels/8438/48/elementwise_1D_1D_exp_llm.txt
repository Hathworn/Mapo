// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data so that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using vectorized operations if applicable to improve throughput.
// Balance the block and grid size to match the hardware architecture for optimal resource utilization.
// Evaluate the use of warp shuffle operations for efficient intra-thread communication.
