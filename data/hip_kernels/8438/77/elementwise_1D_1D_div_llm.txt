```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for temporary storage
// Ensure that loop unrolling does not increase register pressure significantly
// Monitor for warp divergence due to conditional statements
// Investigate memory prefetching techniques to hide latency
