```
// Use shared memory to cache in2 data if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by appropriately aligning threadIdx.x with data indices.
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement if in1ScalarCount is large enough.
// Evaluate if using textures for read-only data (in2) would benefit performance.
// Check if pre-fetching data for next loop iteration can hide memory latency.
