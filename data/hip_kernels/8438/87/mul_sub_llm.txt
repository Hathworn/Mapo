```
// Consider using shared memory for in2 array to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data in memory.
// Utilize read-only data cache for in2 as it can reduce memory latency.
// Examine the possibility of loading data into registers to minimize global memory access.
// If applicable, use texture memory to exploit spatial locality of in2 data.
