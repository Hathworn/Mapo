// Use loop unrolling to improve memory access efficiency and increase instruction throughput
// Ensure coalesced memory access by processing consecutive elements in each iteration
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency
// Avoid branching inside the loop to minimize divergence and maintain high performance
