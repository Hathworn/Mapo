```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure all threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to achieve peak occupancy
// Minimize conditional statements within the kernel
