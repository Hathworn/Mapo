```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used stride values.
// Avoid repeated global memory access by loading stride values once.
// Ensure threads are sufficiently covered with the current block and grid size.
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to improve coalescence.
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution.
