// Unroll loops to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Use switch statements instead of if-else to minimize branching and improve efficiency
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal memory throughput
// Verify alignment of memory accesses for potential performance gains
