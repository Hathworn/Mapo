```
// Consider using shared memory for data that is accessed multiple times
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve memory throughput
// Use vectorized loads/stores to utilize wider memory transactions
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration for maximum occupancy
// Avoid unnecessary checks within the kernel, e.g., bounds checking when guaranteed by launch configuration
