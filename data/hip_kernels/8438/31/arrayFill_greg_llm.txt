```c
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize for coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory.
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the number of variables and using __restrict__ pointers if applicable.
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by balancing register usage and thread count.
// Use the __launch_bounds__() attribute to specify the expected block size and number of registers per thread.
// Consider aligning data for improved memory access performance.
