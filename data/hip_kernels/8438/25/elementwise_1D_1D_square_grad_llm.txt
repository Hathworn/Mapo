```
// Use shared memory for data reuse to minimize global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transaction
// Optimize the usage of registers to prevent spilling into local memory
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further increase parallelism
// Employ prefetching techniques to hide global memory latency
