// Ensure that memory accesses for mask and in are coalesced for better performance
// Use __ldg to load values from the mask array to benefit from the L1 cache
// Consider employing shared memory if mask values are reused across multiple threads within a block
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to further optimize mask checks
