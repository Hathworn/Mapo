// Use shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory accesses  
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations  
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy while minimizing memory latency  
// Consider loop unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism
