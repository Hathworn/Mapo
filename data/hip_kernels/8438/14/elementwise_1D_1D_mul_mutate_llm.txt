```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and enhance bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for in1, in2, and out arrays.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to prevent bank conflicts and improve performance.
// Evaluate thread block size for better occupancy, considering warp-based optimizations.
// Minimize conditional logic within the loop for better computational efficiency.
