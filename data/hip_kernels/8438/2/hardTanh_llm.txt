// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data to minimize memory transaction overhead
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately to avoid race conditions when shared memory is used
// Evaluate warp occupancy and adjust grid/block size for optimal GPU utilization
