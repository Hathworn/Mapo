```
// Consider preferring __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer inputs to help compiler optimizations.
// Ensure the memory accesses (in, out) are coalesced to improve throughput.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can benefit performance for iterating over nElement.
// Consider adjusting the grid/block size to better utilize the GPU resources.
