```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to cache parts of the input data that are reused, reducing global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling if the number of iterations is fixed or known beforehand
// Ensure grid and block sizes are appropriate for the target GPU to maximize occupancy and performance
