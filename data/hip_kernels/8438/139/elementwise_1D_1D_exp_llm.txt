// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Maximize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Ensure that the grid size is optimized to cover the full input size
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
