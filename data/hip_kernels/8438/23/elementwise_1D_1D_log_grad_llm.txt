```c
// Consider using shared memory if there are multiple accesses to out_d or in_x within a warp
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced global memory accesses
// Experiment with different block sizes to potentially improve performance
// Ensure in_x elements are non-zero to avoid division by zero errors
```
