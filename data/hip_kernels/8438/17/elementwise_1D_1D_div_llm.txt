```c
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure data alignment to exploit memory coalescing
// Prefetch data to shared memory if reuse is high to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for higher occupancy
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by using padding if shared memory is used
```
