```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for in_x, in_d, and out_d to maximize memory throughput
// Use shared memory to further optimize data reuse across threads
// Increase block size if possible to improve occupancy
// Optimize stride to match memory access patterns with hardware capabilities
```
