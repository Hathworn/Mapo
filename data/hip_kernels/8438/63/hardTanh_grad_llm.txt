```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Load data into register to reduce read latency
// Select based on inplace to avoid unnecessary computation
// Store result back to global memory only when required
// Use shared memory for intermediate computation to reduce global memory usage
// Sync to ensure all threads have written to shared memory
// Write shared memory result back to global memory efficiently
