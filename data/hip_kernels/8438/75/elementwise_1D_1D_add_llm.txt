```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access with warp boundaries
// Investigate using vectorized data types (e.g., float4) to reduce the number of memory accesses
// Consider using memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
