```cpp
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy if the shared memory allows
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by aligning input data properly
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce overhead
// Consider using registers instead of shared memory for the 'val' variable if it improves performance
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
```
