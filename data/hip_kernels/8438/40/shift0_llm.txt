```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for better cache utilization if input data is frequently reused.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for optimal memory bandwidth usage.
// Minimize global memory access by maximizing data reuse within a thread block.
// Verify out-of-bound checks to prevent unnecessary calculations and potential memory issues.
// Optimize thread block and grid sizes based on the specific hardware architecture for best performance.
