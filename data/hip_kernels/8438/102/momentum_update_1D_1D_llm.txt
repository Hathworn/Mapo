```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory accesses
// Unrolling the loop can improve the performance by reducing loop control overhead
// Use fminf and fmaxf functions for fast operations on floating-point numbers
// Temporarily store d[index] in a register to minimize memory accesses
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Initialize d[index] to 0.0f efficiently after usage to reuse the same register
