```
// Use larger block sizes to improve occupancy if the GPU architecture allows
// Consider using atomics for updates to shared memory to reduce synchronization overhead
// Utilize vectorized memory accesses where possible for better memory throughput
// Investigate if __ldg or other specialized memory access intrinsics can be used for read-only access
// Assess using warp-synchronous programming to avoid syncthreads and reduce synchronization cost
