```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where appropriate.
// Utilize memory alignment and padding to prevent bank conflicts if shared memory is used.
// Explore occupancy by adjusting block size to increase parallelism and resource utilization.
// Investigate memory access patterns for possible cache coherence improvements.
