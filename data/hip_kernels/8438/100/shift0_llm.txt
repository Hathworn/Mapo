```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory if there is data reuse within the same block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the loop unrolling factor to maximize the usage of available registers and improve throughput.
// Consider aligning data structures to cache line sizes to enhance cache performance.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid performance penalties due to misaligned data.
