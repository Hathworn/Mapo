// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to global memory to reduce access time.
// Use memory coalescing techniques to improve memory access patterns and bandwidth.
// Ensure the data type alignment to match memory transaction size for better efficiency.
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and minimize memory access latency.
