// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Verify if loop unrolling is beneficial for this specific workload
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on size for efficient execution
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives for further optimization
