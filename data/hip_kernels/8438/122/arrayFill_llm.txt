// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider occupancy optimization by tuning block size based on hardware constraints
// Use warp synchronous programming to eliminate divergence and improve execution efficiency
