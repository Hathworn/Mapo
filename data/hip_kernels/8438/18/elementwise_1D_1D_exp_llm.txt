```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that the input and output arrays are correctly aligned in memory.
// Use shared memory if there's potential to reuse input data within the block.
// Consider tuning the block size for optimal performance on the target GPU architecture.
// Check for memory access patterns to reduce potential bank conflicts.
