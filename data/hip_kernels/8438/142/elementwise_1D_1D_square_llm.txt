```
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data.
// Ensure memory coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate the grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Avoid unnecessary memory operations, reuse data in registers if possible.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring aligned memory access.
