// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth usage
// Evaluate the use of vectorized loads/stores to further enhance memory throughput
// Tune block and grid sizes to achieve optimal occupancy and performance
