```
// Use shared memory to coalesce loads from global memory
// Employ memory padding to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to improve cache efficiency
// Consider using vectorized data types for reading/writing multiple elements at once
// Optimize occupancy by tuning block size and grid size
// Minimize register usage to allow more threads per block
// Prefetch data to registers to hide memory latency
