// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to minimize latency.
// Try to adjust block size to maximize occupancy and shared memory usage.
// Check if larger shared memory size might improve performance.
// Ensure memory accesses align with warp size for optimal access speed.
// Investigate potential bank conflicts in shared memory and resolve them.
