```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to optimize memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce control overhead
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts, if any shared memory is used
// Use asynchronous memory transfers if applicable
// Ensure registers usage is optimal, possibly by using command line options
```
