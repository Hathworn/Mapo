```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory if data reuse by threads can reduce global memory access
// Investigate bank conflicts in shared memory and optimize access to avoid them
// Apply padding or other techniques to avoid misaligned or inefficient accesses
