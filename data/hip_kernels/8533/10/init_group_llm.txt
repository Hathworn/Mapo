```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory efficiency
// Prefetch data to reduce latency and hide memory access stalls
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction operations
// Profile memory bandwidth usage to identify potential bottlenecks
```
