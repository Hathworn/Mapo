// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring render_buffer is aligned
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access frequency
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop to maintain parallel efficiency
// Ensure that thread blocks cover the entirety of qw_count for complete processing
