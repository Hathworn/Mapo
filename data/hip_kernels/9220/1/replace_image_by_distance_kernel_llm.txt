```
// Coalesce global memory accesses by using contiguous threads to access contiguous memory portions.
// Minimize conditional checks within the loop to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data, like pDepth, to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Align memory accesses to ensure optimal memory transaction sizes, potentially leading to reduced memory latency.
// Use texture memory for read-only access patterns to exploit caching mechanism and improve read efficiency.
