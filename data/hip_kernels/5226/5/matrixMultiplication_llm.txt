```
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for global memory reads
// Use appropriate memory alignment for improved performance
// Minimize use of shared memory to essential data only
// Opt for loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Consider reducing __syncthreads() calls for better efficiency
// Use warp-level primitives for more efficient data exchange
// Ensure grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy
// Experiment with different tile sizes for optimal performance
