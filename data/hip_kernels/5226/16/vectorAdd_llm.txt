```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures.
// Consider shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Adjust block size to fit specific GPU architecture for better performance.
// Use asynchronous memory copy to overlap data transfer with computation.
```
