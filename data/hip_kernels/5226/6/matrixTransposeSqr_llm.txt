```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access patterns
// Align shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure threads access contiguous memory in global memory for coalesced access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Ensure the transposition phase aligns with shared memory to optimize bank access
// Reorder indices during transposition to minimize global memory accesses
// Use tileSize + 1 to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
