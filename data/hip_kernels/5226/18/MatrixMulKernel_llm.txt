// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency  
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory throughput  
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory  
// Consider increasing block size if it fits within shared memory limits  
// Minimize global memory reads and writes by caching frequently accessed data in shared memory  
// Optimize thread synchronization to reduce overhead associated with __syncthreads()
