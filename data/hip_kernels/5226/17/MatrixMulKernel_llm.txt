```
// Cache the row and column indices to improve register usage
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure correct bounds checking to prevent memory access violations
// Optimize memory coalescing patterns for global memory reads
// Employ shared memory efficiently to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded before computation
// Minimize control divergence within the thread block
// Avoid unnecessary computations outside tile bounds
