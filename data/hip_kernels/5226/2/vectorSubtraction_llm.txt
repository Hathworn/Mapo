```
// Consider using shared memory for coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth.
// Ensure the kernel launch configuration aligns with hardware maximum occupancy.
// Avoid unnecessary memory transfers by performing calculations on the GPU directly.
// Ensure data is aligned to improve memory access patterns and cache efficiency.
