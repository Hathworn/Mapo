```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for global reads and writes
// Reduce the use of shared memory if not necessary
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for computational parts
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization to improve performance
```
