//Consider using shared memory to optimize data access patterns for the scaling operation.
//Use cooperative thread arrangements to reduce redundant data access.
//Check if memory coalescing is effective; if not, adjust data structures accordingly.
//Ensure that the memory accesses are aligned to avoid additional memory transactions.
