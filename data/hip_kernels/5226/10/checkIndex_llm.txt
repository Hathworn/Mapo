```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve efficiency.
// Ensure that all threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize divergent branches within warps for better performance.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling techniques could benefit the kernel.
