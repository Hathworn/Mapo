// Use shared memory to cache tiles of M and N to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using asynchronous copy for loading data into shared memory
// Tune block size to enhance occupancy and memory access coalescing
// Ensure memory access patterns lead to coalesced reads and writes to global memory
// Consider aligning row and column calculations to warp size boundaries for optimal performance
