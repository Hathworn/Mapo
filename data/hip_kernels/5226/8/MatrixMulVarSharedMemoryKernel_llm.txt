```
// Ensure coalesced access by aligning shared memory loading across warps
// Reduce bank conflicts by padding shared memory if necessary
// Move conditional checks outside the critical path if possible
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure there are no redundant syncs in the kernel
// Utilize built-in functions and intrinsic operations for efficiency
