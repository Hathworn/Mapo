```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning threads with consecutive memory accesses
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads for frequently accessed data
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring conditionals to avoid warp divergence
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores to optimize memory bandwidth utilization
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques to hide latency of global memory accesses
