```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by having threads access consecutive elements in memory.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if possible.
// Consider using constant memory for read-only parameters like wx, wy, ww, and wh to optimize caching.
// Align float4 loads and stores to ensure optimal memory transactions.
// If gt is not a multiple of idxJump, handle the boundary conditions to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.
