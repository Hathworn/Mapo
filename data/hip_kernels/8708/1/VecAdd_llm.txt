```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Prefetch data to shared memory in advance for better coalescing
// Ensure memory accesses in global scope are coalesced
// Maintain balance of shared memory utilization vs register pressure
// Ensure __syncthreads() is properly placed to avoid race conditions
