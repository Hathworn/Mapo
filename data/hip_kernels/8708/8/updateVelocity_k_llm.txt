// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Optimize access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Minimize memory accesses by preloading data into registers.
// Ensure optimal block and grid size for effective use of GPU resources.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Ensure that the memory allocated is aligned and spaced properly.
