```
// Ensure TILE_SIZE is chosen to maximize occupancy and utilize available shared memory
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring global memory access is contiguous
// Minimize repeated global memory accesses by utilizing shared memory efficiently
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by carefully addressing shared memory arrays
// Consider loop unrolling inside the kernel to reduce loop overhead
// Avoid unnecessary synchronizations for performance improvement
