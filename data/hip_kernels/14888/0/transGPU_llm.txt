// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Loading data to shared memory reduces the number of global memory accesses
// Synchronize threads to ensure data in shared memory is consistent before use
// Transpose block offset to minimize global memory write accesses
// Ensure threads are synchronized before writing data from shared memory to global memory
