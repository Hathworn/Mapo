```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize for coalesced memory access when reading from or writing to global memory
// Consider adjusting shared_data size based on the actual blockDim.x to avoid unused memory
// Ensure __syncthreads() is correctly placed after writing to shared_data for accurate synchronization
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism for the for loop
// Use atomic operations sparingly to minimize serialization and performance bottlenecks
// Evaluate the impact of different block sizes on performance, balance between occupancy and memory bandwidth
// Profile memory access patterns to identify and minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
