```
// Use shared memory to store the a and ia matrices to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use coalesced memory access for the coord array to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using float4 or similar types for coord fetching to take advantage of vectorized loads.
// Reduce the use of __syncthreads() where possible to minimize warp divergence.
