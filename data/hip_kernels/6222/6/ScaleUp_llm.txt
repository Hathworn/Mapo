```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_Data loads
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads
// Evaluate the balance between computation and memory transfer
// Ensure memory alignment to improve coalescing performance
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Preload data into registers when possible to reduce memory access latency
