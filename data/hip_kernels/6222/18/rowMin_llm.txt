```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory access for improved performance
// Implement parallel reduction pattern for selection sort optimization
// Ensure synchronization after loading data into shared memory
// Avoid unnecessary swaps in selection sort to improve efficiency
