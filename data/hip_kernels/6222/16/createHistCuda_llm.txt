```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning simultaneous thread access patterns
// Reduce register usage by utilizing local variables only when necessary
// Minimize shared memory usage for cosine values to reduce shared memory conflicts
// Consider vectorizing computation for parallel processing efficiency
// Use texture memory for siftCentroids and siftImage to benefit from caching
