```c
// Pre-calculate bin index and reciprocal of y to minimize re-computation.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to small data sets like d_cdf_norm.
// Minimize use of division operations by precomputing reciprocal where possible.
// Leverage fma (fused multiply-add) for efficient arithmetic operations.
// Avoid branching inside the main loop to ensure consistent execution paths.
// Consider loop unrolling for small, fixed-size loops if applicable.
