```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations to improve bandwidth.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring threads access distinct memory banks.
// Use shared memory to cache intermediate results to minimize global memory accesses.
// Implement loop unrolling for reducing stride to improve throughput.
