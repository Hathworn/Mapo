// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Perform two global memory loads in one instruction to increase data throughput
// Ensure no out of bounds memory access for better efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize and avoid race conditions
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls by optimizing the reduction loop
// Coalesce global memory writes for better performance
