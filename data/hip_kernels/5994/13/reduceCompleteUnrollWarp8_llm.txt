```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Unroll loops to minimize loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by organizing data fetching appropriately.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory where possible.
// Use volatile memory access on the last warp for faster synchronization.
