```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency if possible
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Consider using loop unrolling for further thread-level parallelism
// Minimize branch divergence by avoiding conditional statements in critical paths
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum warp occupancy
```
