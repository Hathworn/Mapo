```
// Consider coalesced memory access for g_idata to improve memory access efficiency
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads execute the same path
// Ensure 'n' is a multiple of warp size to avoid out-of-range accesses
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization stalls
