// Use grid-stride loop to maximize parallelism
// Ensure data is allocated in contiguous memory blocks for coalesced access
// Consider shared memory to store intermediate results for better locality
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access if implemented
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on hardware capabilities
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads perform similar operations
