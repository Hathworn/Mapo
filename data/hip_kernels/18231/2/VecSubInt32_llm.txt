```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Consider memory alignment to improve coalesced access
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Explore using asynchronous copy to overlap computation and memory transfer
// Utilize vectorized memory access for better efficiency
