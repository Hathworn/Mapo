// Ensure coalesced memory access for in0 and in1 to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Consider using a larger shared memory block to efficiently utilize shared memory
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques to hide memory latency
// Align memory accesses to improve performance
// Optimize the use of shared memory to prevent bank conflicts
