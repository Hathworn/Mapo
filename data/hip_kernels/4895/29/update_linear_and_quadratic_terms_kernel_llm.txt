```
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed global data like cur_tot_weight.
// Implement loop unrolling for the iteration over 'n' to reduce loop overhead.
// Prefetch data into registers in advance within the loop to hide memory latency.
// Consider memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns within the loop.
// Minimize warp divergence by aligning computation within warps.
