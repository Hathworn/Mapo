```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure all elements are loaded into shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Start computation from idx = 1 to skip non-essential calculation for thread 0.
// Use float2 loads for efficient pair-wise access and computation.
// Synchronize threads to ensure all shared data is available before use.
// Avoid redundant computation by handling the first element separately.
// Utilize vectorized operations when accessing and computing data in shared memory.
