```
// Use shared memory if data reuse occurs per thread block to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced access patterns for the 'feats' array to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Apply loop unrolling if kernel's computation is limited by arithmetic throughput
// Ensure memory alignment of 'feats' and 'feats_sq' for better memory access performance
