```
// Use shared memory to store lifter coefficients for efficient access by all threads within a block.
// Avoid repeated memory access by preloading shared_lifter_coeffs in shared memory.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns within shared_lifter_coeffs to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal occupancy and resource utilization.
