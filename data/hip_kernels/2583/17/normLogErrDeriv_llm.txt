```
// Consider coalesced access to global memory by ensuring thread blocks access consecutive elements in memory
// Preload shared memory with data from global memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize faster math libraries where precision requirements allow, such as using __expf when possible instead of expf for enhanced performance
// Minimize redundant calculations by reusing computed values within the thread
// Group related computations to maintain data in registers and reduce memory overhead
// Optimize thread block dimensions to ensure full occupancy and efficient memory access patterns
