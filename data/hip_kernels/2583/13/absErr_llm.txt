// Consider coalescing global memory access patterns for improved memory bandwidth usage
// Investigate asynchronous loads to hide memory latency and improve throughput
// Ensure optimal block and grid sizes to maximize hardware occupancy
// Explore using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic
