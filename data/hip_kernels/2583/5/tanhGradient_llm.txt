```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache z values to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for calculations within the branch
// Optimize thread block size for maximum warp occupancy
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations
// Avoid potential bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
```
