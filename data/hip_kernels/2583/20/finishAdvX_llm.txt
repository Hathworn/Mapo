```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data in a structure of arrays (SoA) format.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Employ vector data types such as float2 or float4 for better memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling and minimizing redundant computations within the kernel.
// Explore occupancy tuning by adjusting block size for better GPU utilization.
// Use read-only cache if applicable for the 'X' data to enhance memory read efficiency.
