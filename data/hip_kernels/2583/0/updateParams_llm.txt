```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Consider data alignment for coalesced memory access
// Employ loop unrolling for straight-line code paths
// Optimize reduction across threads for faster updates
// Minimize atomic operations for reduced contention
// Balance grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Use constant memory for immutable values like alpha, beta1, beta2
