```
// Avoid uncoalesced memory accesses by ensuring memory access patterns are optimal
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance if applicable
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Ensure enough parallelism to keep the GPU cores busy
