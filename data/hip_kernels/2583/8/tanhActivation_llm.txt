```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache z values for coalesced memory access.
// Adjust the block dimensions to optimize for memory bandwidth.
// Utilize __restrict__ pointers for z to help with optimizing memory access.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by reordering branches or using __shfl_sync() for values.
