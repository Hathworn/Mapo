// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring conditional checks are straightforward.
// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory if needed for larger data sizes.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads and writes.
// Look into reducing thread synchronization overhead if applicable.
