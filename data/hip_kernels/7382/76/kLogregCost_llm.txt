```cpp
// Use shared memory if possible to store intermediate values like maxProbs to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using __syncthreads() after shared memory writes to synchronize threads before reading.
// Use vectorized memory loads/stores if applicable to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by organizing data in memory so that threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Assess if using texture memory for reading probs or labels could offer performance benefits due to caching.
