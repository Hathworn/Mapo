// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance.
// Implement coalescing access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Optimize the memory access by accessing gradOutput_data in a coalesced manner.
