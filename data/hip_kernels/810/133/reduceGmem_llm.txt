// Consider using shared memory for the reduction steps to reduce global memory access.
// Unroll the loop more aggressively for better performance.
// Use __shared__ memory to make the reduction steps more efficient and reduce latency.
// Consider using atomic operations for the final accumulation to ensure thread safety.
