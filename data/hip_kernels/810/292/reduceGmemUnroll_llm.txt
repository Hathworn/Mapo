```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access during unrolling
// Exploit memory coalescing in the loop for in-place reduction
// Use atomic operations to optimize the reduction further where possible
// Memory access patterns can be improved by considering neighboring threads
// Load data from global to shared memory effectively to minimize latency
