```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for the reduction operations
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data for threads within the same warp
// Prefetch data to shared memory to improve memory access latency
// Avoid divergent branching by ensuring each warp executes the same instructions
