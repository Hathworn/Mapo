// Coalesce global memory accesses for g_idata and g_odata.
// Consider shared memory usage to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure all active threads contribute early before synchronization.
// Unroll the last few iterations of the reduction loop to reduce overhead.
// Align memory accesses to improve throughput.
