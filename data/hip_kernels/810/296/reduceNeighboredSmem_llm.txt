```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve throughput.
// Ensure enough threads are active to achieve full device utilization.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts for faster data access.
// Optimize thread divergence during the reduction process.
// Ensure `blockDim.x` is a power of two for efficient reduction.
