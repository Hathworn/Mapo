```
// Load data in coalesced manner to improve memory bandwidth
// Ensure proper memory alignment for increased performance
// Consider using shared memory to minimize access to global memory
// Use warp shuffle functions instead of volatile for warp reductions
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp to maximize efficiency
