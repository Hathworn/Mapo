```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Employ loop unrolling to minimize the number of iterations
// Combine multiple reduction steps to decrease the need for synchronization
// Minimize syncthreads by unrolling the last warp
// Use volatile keyword to avoid memory caching issues in warp-level reduction
