```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Consider adjusting the block size to improve warp utilization
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning block and thread indices
// Reduce bank conflicts by using padding (IPAD) in shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have written to shared memory before reading
// Check for boundary conditions to avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory
