```
// Use unrolling to reduce the number of memory accesses.
// Ensure all threads within a block load data into shared memory to optimize memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for reducing global memory accesses.
// Minimize thread divergence through uniform workload distribution.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronizations.
