```
// Ensure data is appropriately aligned in memory for coalesced access
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns
// Use constexpr or memory pointers instead of magic numbers for readability
// Optimize the warp synchronization to eliminate unnecessary barriers
// Inline small functions to reduce function call overhead in the GPU kernel
