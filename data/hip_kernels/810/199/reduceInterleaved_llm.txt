```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve coalescing
// Ensure boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Perform reduction in shared memory to minimize global memory operations
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after each step of reduction
// Optimize the shared memory usage to store intermediate results
