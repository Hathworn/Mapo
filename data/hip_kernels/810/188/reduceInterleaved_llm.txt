```
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing when accessing global memory (g_idata and g_odata).
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts during accesses.
// Avoid unnecessary boundary checks by optimizing grid and block configurations.
// Use warp-aware reduction techniques to minimize thread divergence for better performance.
