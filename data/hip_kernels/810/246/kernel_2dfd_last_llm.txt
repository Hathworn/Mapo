// Ensure tile data is loaded before computing to maximize memory coalescing and reduce global memory accesses.
// Leverage shared memory to minimize bandwidth and optimize memory accesses in the calculation.
// Minimize arithmetic intensity by storing intermediary results in registers for reuse.
// Unroll loops for further reduction in loop control overhead, optimizing pipeline execution.
// Consider increasing BDIMX for better resource utilization and parallelism, depending on hardware constraints.
// Reduce synchronization barriers by restructuring computation patterns when feasible.
