// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced access to dRand array for better memory throughput.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to potentially increase compiler optimizations.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and resource utilization.
