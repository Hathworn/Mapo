```c
// Improve data coalescing during global memory access for input_values
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost reduction loop to reduce loop overhead
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to minimize unnecessary synchronization
// Ensure efficient use of atomic operations to prevent contention
