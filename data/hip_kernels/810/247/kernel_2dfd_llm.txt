```cpp
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like g_u2 if access patterns are spatially coherent.
// Prefetch and use registers to store temporary data yval to minimize latency and maximize data reuse.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses, optimizing for data locality.
// Unroll small loops to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for g_u2 and g_u1 to optimize global memory bandwidth usage.
// Use __syncthreads() cautiously as it can introduce overhead; ensure it's necessary for data dependencies.
