```
// Consider aligning memory accesses with warp boundaries to optimize memory usage.
// Use __restrict__ to allow the compiler more freedom for optimization.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Evaluate usage of shared memory to minimize global memory bandwidth.
// If applicable, implement loop unrolling for performance gains.
// Consider using asynchronous data transfers where possible.
// Employ occupancy calculator to ensure maximum hardware utilization.
// Evaluate the use of constant memory for frequently accessed data.
