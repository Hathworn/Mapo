```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for g_idata[idx] and g_idata[idx + blockDim.x] to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize the use of global memory by storing data in shared memory when possible, particularly in unrolled loops.
// Utilize shared memory bank conflict avoidance techniques to enhance performance.
// Optimize shared memory utilization by aligning shared_data array to prevent bank conflicts when accessing consecutive elements.
// Ensure that loads and stores to shared memory are coalesced to reduce latency.
// Configure grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and efficient use of resources.
