```
// Use coalesced memory access for global memory reads.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization points.
// Ensure that shared memory usage is optimized to prevent bank conflicts.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by restructuring the reduction pattern.
// Consider splitting large blocks into smaller ones to improve occupancy.
