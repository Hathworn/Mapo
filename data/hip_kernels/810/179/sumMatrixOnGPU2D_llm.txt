// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data locality
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring successive threads access successive memory locations
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize GPU occupancy
// Use asynchronous memory operations to overlap computation and data transfer
// Utilize read-only data cache for MatA and MatB when possible
