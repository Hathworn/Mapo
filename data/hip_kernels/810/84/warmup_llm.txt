// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads and writes
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring contiguous memory access for threads
// Optimize block and grid sizes for better GPU occupancy
// Align memory accesses to reduce bank conflicts
// Explore loop unrolling techniques if applicable
