```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Load two elements per thread to leverage memory bandwidth
// Ensure enough shared memory is allocated for sharedA and sharedB
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Using shared memory reduces redundant global memory accesses
