```
// Consider using shared memory for initial loads to reduce global memory transactions
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses by aligning data accesses to the warp size
// Use '__syncthreads()' only when necessary to minimize synchronization overhead
// Leverage shared memory bank conflicts to optimize memory access patterns
// Evaluate the need to use 'volatile' for warp-level reduction to guarantee correct memory access behaviour
