// Consider coalesced access to global memory to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if possible.
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration for better occupancy.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel.
