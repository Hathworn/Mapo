// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal memory bandwidth utilization
// Use occupancy calculator to determine optimal block size and enhance efficiency
// Implement loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism further
// Evaluate warp divergence to optimize the control flow performance
