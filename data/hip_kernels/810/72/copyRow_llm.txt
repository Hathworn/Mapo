```
// Ensure block size matches shared memory tile size for optimal memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute similarly
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved bandwidth utilization
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
