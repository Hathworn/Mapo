// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Loop unrolling improves memory throughput by processing multiple elements per thread
// Align memory access and reduce bank conflicts with shared memory
// Memory access coalescing to improve access patterns
// Minimize warp divergence by keeping warp reductions in volatile memory
