```
// Consider aligning memory for F and D to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure data is accessed in a coalesced manner to reduce global memory transactions
// Use __shared__ memory if frequent access to F and D is needed across threads
// Minimize the number of blocks if only a small number of threads need to update F and D
// Use appropriate data types for F and D considering computation precision and memory size
