// Use coalesced access patterns when reading from global memory into shared memory
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Ensure enough shared memory is allocated for the tile data
// Consider using loop unrolling if applicable to further optimize memory access
// Assess the occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance
