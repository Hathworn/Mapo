// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced global reads and writes.
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for each thread block.
// Minimize data transfer between global memory and registers by storing frequently used data in registers.
// Evaluate potential warp divergence optimizations by aligning thread work to warp sizes.
