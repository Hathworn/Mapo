```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure appropriate block and grid size to maximize warp utilization
// Consider bank conflicts in shared memory and adjust access patterns accordingly
// Load data efficiently using coalesced access to shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency
// Optimize boundary checks to reduce redundant computations
