```
// Ensure coalesced access by using contiguous memory regions
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses if necessary
// Unrolling can reduce loop overhead, but ensure it matches the data alignment for optimization
// Using registers to store intermediate results minimizes global memory access time
// Adjust grid and block size to maximize memory throughput and occupancy
