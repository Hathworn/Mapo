// Utilize contiguous memory access patterns for efficiency
// Leverage shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider memory coalescing by accessing global memory in sequential order
// Apply loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and enhance performance
// Use warp-synchronous programming to minimize synchronization overhead
