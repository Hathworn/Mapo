// Consider using coalesced memory access to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Double-check padding in shared memory allocation to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure proper synchronization after updating shared memory to prevent data races.
// Evaluate if using atomic operations could further optimize the reduction in shared memory.
