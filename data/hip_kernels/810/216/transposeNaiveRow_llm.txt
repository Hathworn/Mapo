```
// Load a tile into shared memory to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Use shared memory to reduce costly global memory access
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded into shared memory before accessing
// Consider using float4 type to leverage vectorized memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access when writing data back to global memory
