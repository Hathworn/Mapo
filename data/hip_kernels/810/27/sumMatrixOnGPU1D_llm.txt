// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Investigate the use of memory coalescing to improve performance.
// Check whether using a 2D grid and block setup would be more suitable for matrix operations.
// Validate if loop unrolling could provide any performance benefits.
// Examine whether pre-fetching data into registers can minimize latency.
