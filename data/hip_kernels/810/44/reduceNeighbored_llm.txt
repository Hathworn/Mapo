// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for g_idata
// Use shared memory to store reduction results to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure proper alignment of shared memory to improve access performance
// Consider loop unrolling for further reduction of loop overhead
// Exploit warp synchronous programming for optimization within a warp
