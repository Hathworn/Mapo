```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Employ memory coalescing by altering data structures for optimal access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed-size kernel functions to enhance performance
// Cache frequently used data to reduce repeated memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branching in the kernel for better efficiency
// Align data structures to memory boundaries for improved access speed
