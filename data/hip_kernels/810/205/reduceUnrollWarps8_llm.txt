```
// Consider memory coalescing to improve global memory load efficiency
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate sums to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
// Investigate using __restrict__ for pointer parameters to improve memory access optimization
// Ensure enough occupancy to hide latency associated with global memory accesses
