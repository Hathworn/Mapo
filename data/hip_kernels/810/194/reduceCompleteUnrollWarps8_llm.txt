```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency.
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize data reads.
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput and reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure synchronization after global memory writes to maintain data integrity.
// Implement loop unrolling inside warp execution for efficiency.
// Utilize volatile pointers for warp-synchronous programming within a warp.
// Optimize reduction pattern for warp shuffle instruction support.
