```
// Consider aligning memory access to warp boundaries for better coalescing
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Try increasing thread block sizes to improve occupancy
// Experiment with using more threads per block for better utilization
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce latency
// Consider loop unrolling techniques if applicable
