// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access within each block.
// Align data accesses to ensure coalesced memory transactions.
// Use __restrict__ for pointers if applicable to aid compiler optimizations.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring if conditions are satisfied uniformly across warps.
