```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Leverage shared memory to further reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use warp shuffle functions to optimize within-warp reduction instead of volatile memory
// Align memory accesses to eliminate bank conflicts in shared memory
