```
// Consider using float4 data type for coalesced memory access
// Utilize __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce overhead
// Ensure shared memory is accessed in coalesced pattern to maximize bandwidth
// Evaluate use of __launch_bounds__ for better kernel configuration
// Use compiler flags for additional optimization during compilation
