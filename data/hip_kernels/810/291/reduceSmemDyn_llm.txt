// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Ensure shared memory allocation is optimized and minimizes bank conflicts
// Evaluate using atomic operations to potentially reduce synchronization overhead
// Check for warp divergence in the unrolled loop for last warp and optimize if necessary
// Consider aligning data structures to improve memory access efficiency
