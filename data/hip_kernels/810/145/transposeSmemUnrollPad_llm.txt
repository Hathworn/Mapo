```
// Utilize shared memory effectively by padding to avoid bank conflicts
// Use register tiling to minimize global memory accesses
// Prefetch data into shared memory to optimize global memory access
// Implement unrolling for loop iterations to increase parallelism
// Ensure boundary checks are optimized to avoid unnecessary computations
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
