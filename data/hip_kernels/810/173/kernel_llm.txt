```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limitations
// Align memory accesses to enable coalesced global memory reads and writes
// Consider using vectorized data types for optimized memory throughput
// Balance the number of threads per block for optimal occupancy and performance
