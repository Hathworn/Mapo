```c
// Ensure shared memory size matches block dimension for efficiency
// Use __restrict__ keyword on pointers A, B, C to enable compiler optimizations
// Consider coalesced memory access for A and B to improve bandwidth utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by proper indexing
// Experiment with larger or smaller block sizes to find optimal configuration for target hardware
```
