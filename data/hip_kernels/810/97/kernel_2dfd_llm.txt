```
// Consider increasing the thread block size for better parallel efficiency.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Apply padding in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts and improve performance.
// Preload data into registers to reduce latency associated with accessing global memory.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring aligned memory access patterns.
// Minimize redundant calculations by storing repeated values in registers.
// Use prefetching to hide memory latency from global memory to shared or registers.
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() is only when absolutely necessary to avoid warp divergence and synchronization overhead.
