// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider memory coalescing for better bandwidth utilization
// Use loop unrolling for better utilization of compute resources
// Ensure proper alignment for memory access to leverage coalesced loads
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
