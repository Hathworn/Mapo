// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access.  
// Explore using vectorized loads/stores to improve memory throughput.
// Test different block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy.
// Minimize shared memory usage if possible, or optimize shared memory bank access.
