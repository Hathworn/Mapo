```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning global memory access with warp boundaries.
// Use __ldg() for reading constant data if dcoef is constant.
// Consider double buffering or loop unrolling for better performance.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Consider increasing the block size to achieve better occupancy if resources permit.
// Optimize shared memory usage by using dynamic shared memory if block size varies.
