```c
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory accesses
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization overhead
// Load data into shared memory in chunks to coalesce memory accesses
// Avoid conditional statements inside loops for performance improvement
// Try loop unrolling in reduction stage to minimize iteration overhead
```
