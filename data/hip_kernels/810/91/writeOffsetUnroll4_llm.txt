```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized to prevent memory bank conflicts
// Use larger unrolling factor if registers and shared memory permit for further optimization
// Align memory accesses to warp size to maximize performance
// Investigate the use of vectorized loads/stores to utilize memory more efficiently
