```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring g_idata is accessed sequentially within a warp for improved memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access during the reduction phase to improve performance.
// Avoid use of volatile keyword if not necessary, as it can lead to inefficient memory operations.
// Utilize __shfl_down_sync for warp-level primitives instead of manual unrolling to achieve better performance on newer architectures.
// Evaluate using float instead of int for g_idata and g_odata, if application benefits from reduced precision and might leverage throughput.
