```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Prefetch global memory data to registers for faster access
// Unroll loops to increase throughput and minimize loop overhead
// Implement warp unrolling to further reduce loop overhead 
// Use volatile keyword to prevent compiler optimizations in warp unrolling 
```
