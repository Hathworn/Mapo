```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll the loop to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after writing to shared memory
// Use volatile keyword to prevent compiler optimization in warp unrolling
// Minimize global memory transactions by coalescing accesses
// Only thread 0 writes the result back to global memory
```
