```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure each thread has contiguous memory access for coalescing
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before reducing
// Apply loop unrolling to optimize the last warp execution
// Leverage volatile pointers for warp-synchronous programming
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring uniform control flow
// The first thread writes the result back to global memory to avoid race conditions
