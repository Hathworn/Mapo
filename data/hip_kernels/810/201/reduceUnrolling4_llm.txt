```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data fetch with warp.
// Minimize memory latency by fetching continuous data for unrolled loops.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within the block.
// Perform in-place reduction using shared memory for efficient data reuse.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring memory accesses are well-aligned.
// Make sure to synchronize threads within the block to ensure correctness.
