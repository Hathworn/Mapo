```
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring data accessed by threads in a warp are contiguous
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts when multiple threads access the same memory bank
// Enable warp synchronous programming to fully utilize warp execution efficiency
// Use const memory for read-only data that is frequently accessed to utilize the fast path
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead further and increase ILP
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() calls after reductions smaller than warp size
// Profile the kernel execution to identify and eliminate potential bottlenecks
