```
// Ensure shared memory size matches block size for efficient use
// Use __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions and ensure safe access
// Align data accesses to improve cache performance
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable for further performance gain
// Re-use loaded shared memory data across multiple operations if possible
// Evaluate shared memory bank conflicts and restructure if needed
