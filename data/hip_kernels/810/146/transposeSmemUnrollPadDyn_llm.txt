```
// Use double buffering technique to overlap computation with data transfer.
// Consider optimizing thread block size to fully utilize shared memory bandwidth.
// Improve memory coalescing by aligning data to specific boundaries.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput.
// Implement occupancy calculator to find optimal launch configurations.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for fine-grained synchronization.
