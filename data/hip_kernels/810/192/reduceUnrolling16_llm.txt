```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses where possible
// Consider loop unrolling and vectorized memory instructions for better efficiency
// Strive to minimize thread divergence through condition checks optimization
// Optimize the memory access pattern to improve coalescing and reduce latency
// Ensure zero warp divergence during reduction stages
```
