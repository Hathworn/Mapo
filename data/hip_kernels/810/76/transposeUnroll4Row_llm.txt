```
// Use shared memory to stage data and reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve bandwidth efficiency.
// Unroll loops further if register pressure allows for better performance.
// Align data to improve memory access patterns and decrease cache misses.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for optimal hardware utilization.
