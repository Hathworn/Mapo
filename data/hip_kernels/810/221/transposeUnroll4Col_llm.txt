```c
// Use registers for repeated calculations to reduce register pressure
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory if possible
// Ensure coalesced accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Utilize loop unrolling to decrease the overhead of loop control
// Align memory accesses to warp boundaries to improve access efficiency
```
