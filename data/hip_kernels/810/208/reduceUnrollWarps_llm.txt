```
// Consider minimizing data transfers between global and shared memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, enhancing memory throughput
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to maximize bandwidth
// Utilize memory coalescing patterns by carefully aligning data structures
// Use loop unrolling to optimize performance beyond the existing unrolling factor
// Implement appropriate memory prefetching strategies
// Use idle threads for useful computations such as prefetching or loading shared memory
