```
// Consider increasing block size to improve occupancy and reduce idle threads
// Ensure data alignment for efficient memory access
// Use more shared memory to better overlap computation and communication
// Prefetch data to shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Use warp-level primitives for faster reduction within a warp
// Minimize __syncthreads() by restructuring the reduction loop
// Evaluate if using half-precision can improve memory bandwidth utility
