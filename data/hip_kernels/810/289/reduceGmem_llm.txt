```cpp
// Use shared memory to optimize global memory accesses
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same path
// Align memory access patterns to coalesce global memory reads and writes
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce the loop overhead, especially for warp-level operations
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize threads only when necessary
// Consider using the __shfl_xor_sync intrinsic for intra-warp communication in reduction
