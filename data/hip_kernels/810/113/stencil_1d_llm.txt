```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Use index calculations to coalesce global memory access
// Ensure the grid size is sufficient to cover large input sizes
// Read global memory once and use shared memory for frequent access
// Employ boundary checks to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
// Use #pragma unroll to improve loop performance by unrolling
// Limit the use of __syncthreads() to critical sections only
