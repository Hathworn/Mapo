```
// Use coalesced memory access to optimize memory bandwidth
// Minimize memory latency by ensuring aligned access
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance
