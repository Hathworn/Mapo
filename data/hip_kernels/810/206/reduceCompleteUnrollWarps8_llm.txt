```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Use warp shuffles to replace the volatile memory access in the warp unrolling.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced global memory accesses.
// Potentially replace __syncthreads() with warp-level synchronizations if applicable.
// Consider loop unrolling more aggressively in unroll sections for better performance.
// Analyze the thread block sizes for optimal occupancy and memory throughput.
