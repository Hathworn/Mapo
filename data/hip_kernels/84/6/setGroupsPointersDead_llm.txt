```
// Consider memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns.
// Use __restrict__ pointers if possible to inform the compiler that pointers do not alias.
// Investigate if using shared memory or caches can improve access speed.
// Check if loop unrolling can expedite repeated operations for higher throughput.
// Profile for warp divergence and optimize conditional branching inside the kernel.
// Align data structures to improve load/store efficiency and reduce misaligned accesses.
