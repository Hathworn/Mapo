```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if applicable to tell the compiler that pointers do not alias
// Consider aligning data structures to allow for coalesced memory accesses
// Use shared memory to store locally reused data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that kernel launch settings (block and grid sizes) are optimized for hardware
// Use texture memory for read-only data if access patterns align with its benefits
