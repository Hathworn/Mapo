```
// Use shared memory for repeated access to frequently used data.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures to the warp size.
// Minimize device memory accesses by using registers effectively.
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce global memory transactions.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce overhead.
