```cpp
// Consider using float2 or float4 loads for Y, dY, and dX to improve memory throughput
// Ensure data alignment to utilize coalesced memory access
// Preload data into shared memory if dim is small enough for reuse benefits
// Utilize __shfl_down_sync for warp-level reduction to minimize __syncthreads overhead
// Explore the use of warp shuffle operations to optimize reduction across block threads
