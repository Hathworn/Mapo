```
// Consider loading a block of data into shared memory for coalesced access
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
// Ensure data is aligned to reduce memory bottlenecks
// Apply loop unrolling more extensively to reduce loop overhead
// Utilize __syncthreads() if using shared memory to ensure all threads have completed data loading
// Evaluate if more opportunities for reducing global memory accesses exist
