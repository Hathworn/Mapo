```
// Utilize coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive data indices
// Minimize memory transactions by using float4 to load/store data, reducing latency
// Leverage vectorized operations to maximize throughput and computation efficiency
// Optimize thread block size to achieve maximum occupancy and load balance
// Consider using shared memory if access patterns or reuse justify the overhead
