// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Use inline functions for operations that are repetitive to reduce kernel execution overhead.
// Ensure data alignment for float4 data types to maximize memory access efficiency.
// Consider using asynchronous memory copy and page-locked host memory for faster data transfer between host and device.
