```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by adjusting memory access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling for the accumulation loop to increase throughput
// Precompute gaussian_kernel offsets if possible to reduce computation inside loops
// Align memory accesses to support efficient coalesced reads and writes
