```cpp
// Combine memory reads and writes to coalesce memory access
// Use float4 vectors to optimize data throughput for d_Iout
// Pre-compute scalar multiplication to reduce operations inside the kernel
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to improve cache utilization
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring conditional branches are outside critical paths
```
