```
// Ensure memory coalescing by verifying alignment of d_positions and d_modelBuffer
// Consider preferring shared memory for intermediate computation if data reuse is possible
// Minimize global memory accesses by leveraging registers for temporary data storage
// Analyze occupancy to ensure that block and grid sizes are optimized for architecture
// Investigate memory access patterns to prevent bank conflicts if shared memory is used
