```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Minimize memory transactions by storing intermediate results in registers
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Ensure kernel launch configuration matches hardware capabilities for occupancy
// Optimize thread block size for maximum occupancy and memory throughput
