```
// Consider using shared memory to store gradOutput_data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern by adjusting data layout if necessary.
// Pre-fetch data into registers to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Increase block size to optimize occupancy and maximize resource utilization.
// Consider optimizing the loop unrolling based on hardware characteristics.
