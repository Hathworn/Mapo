// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to increase computation throughput
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce latency
