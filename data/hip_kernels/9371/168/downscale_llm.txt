// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate accumulations
// Ensure full utilization of warp size by aligning the loop iterations
// Use loop unrolling for the inner loop for better performance
// Minimize register usage by reducing unnecessary variable usage
