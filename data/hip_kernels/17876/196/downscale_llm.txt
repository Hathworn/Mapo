// Use __device__ __forceinline__ to reduce function call overhead for idx()  
// Change nested loops order if it helps coalesced memory access  
// Prefer shared memory if multiple threads access the same data frequently  
// Use thread block strides that are powers of two to enable warp-level optimizations  
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads follow similar paths
