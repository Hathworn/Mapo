// Use __ldg to cache reads from global memory
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Prefetch data from global memory into registers to minimize latency
// Align data structures to improve coalesced access patterns
// Balance the workload among threads to achieve optimal parallel efficiency
