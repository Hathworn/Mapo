// Use __restrict__ qualifier to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Replace global memory accesses with __ldg() for read-only data to optimize memory transactions.
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block for more efficient parallelization.
// Precompute and cache intermediate calculations to reduce redundant computations.
// Apply loop unrolling to improve branching efficiency, especially within the inner loop.
// Explore shared memory use for repeated access to common data among threads in the same block.
// Minimize memory access latency by coalescing global memory accesses where possible.
