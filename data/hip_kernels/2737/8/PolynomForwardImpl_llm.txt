```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for probs and values
// Align memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory transactions
// Minimize synchronization overhead by optimizing the data loading phase
// Ensure shared memory size fits the constraints and is fully utilized
// Use __ldg to leverage read-only cache and optimize global memory reads
// Optimize thread-block configuration for load balancing and occupancy
