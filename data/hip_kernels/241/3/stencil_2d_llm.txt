```cpp
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning halo and in-memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to minimize repeated global memory accesses.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring that shared memory accesses are appropriately aligned.
// Consider using dynamic shared memory if the aperture size may vary.
