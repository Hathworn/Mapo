// Use shared memory or registers to cache data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Loop unrolling can be applied to reduce branch overhead and improve pipeline throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to optimize read/write operations on global memory.
// Adjust the granularity of memory accesses to match the warp size for better efficiency.
// Consider using atomic operations for synchronization to enhance parallel processing.
