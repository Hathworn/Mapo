```
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve bandwidth efficiency
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts to optimize memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Incorporate warp-level primitives for better intra-warp collaboration
// Avoid unnecessary recalculations within the loop for efficiency
