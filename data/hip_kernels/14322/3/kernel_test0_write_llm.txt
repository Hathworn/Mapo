```
// Ensure coalesced accesses by aligning data structures and memory access patterns
// Minimize the use of shared memory barring necessity to reduce latency
// Align memory access to a multiple of the warp size to reduce bank conflicts
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to indicate that pointer arguments do not alias
// Leverage texture or read-only data cache for frequent read-only accesses
// Evaluate the use of faster local or register memory for frequently accessed data
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and efficient memory access
