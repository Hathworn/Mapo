// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous threads access sequential memory locations
// Consider using atomic operations if data integrity issues are detected
// Evaluate the block size for best performance based on specific GPU architecture
// Ensure data alignment to avoid performance bottlenecks due to misaligned memory access
