```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize memory accesses for arrays a, b, and ct.
// Reduce global memory accesses by storing repeated accessed elements in registers.
// Minimize divergence in conditional statements by using consistent thread patterns.
// Align memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses.
// Ensure that memory allocations are aligned with the warp size for optimal performance.
