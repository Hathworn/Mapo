```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes.
// Utilize loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Minimize the use of branch divergence by restructuring conditional logic.
// Explore leveraging constant memory for frequently accessed 'ct' array.
// Align global memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries for optimal performance.
// Avoid bank conflicts when possible by optimizing shared memory access patterns.
