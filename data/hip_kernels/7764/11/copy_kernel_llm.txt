// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to further reduce global memory access.
// Ensure enough threads per block to fully utilize memory coalescing.
// Validate that data alignment is correct for double2 usage to avoid misalignment penalties.
// Check whether loop unrolling could benefit performance in case of repeated operations.
// Monitor memory throughput to ensure the bottleneck is addressed by this coalesced access methodology.
