```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Leverage registers for variables repeatedly accessed within a thread
// Avoid out-of-bounds memory access for increased kernel safety
// Ensure all threads synchronize before using shared data
// Optimize arithmetic operations to minimize computation
// Reuse intermediate results to reduce redundant calculations
// Special case handling for j2 = 0 to ensure correct results
