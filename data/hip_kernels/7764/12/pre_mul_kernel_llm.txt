```cpp
// Ensure memory alignment for better coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access nearby elements
// Pre-fetch and store data into registers to reduce memory latency
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by using registers
// Ensure that the kernel execution configuration maximizes occupancy
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for data sharing within a warp
// Align array sizes to the warp size to minimize warp divergence
// Use __ldg for read-only data to benefit from read-only cache
