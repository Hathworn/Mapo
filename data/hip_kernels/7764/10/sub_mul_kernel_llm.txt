// Utilize shared memory for 'ct' to minimize global memory access.
// Consider pre-fetching data into registers where possible to reduce memory latency.
// Reduce redundant calculations by pre-computing certain values ahead of the loop.
// Use conditional statements to optimize branch divergences for different thread conditions.
