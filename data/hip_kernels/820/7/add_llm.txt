```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for arrays a, b, and c
// Ensure memory allocation aligns with hardware requirements for optimal performance
// Use shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data by multiple threads
// Investigate memory latency hiding techniques such as increasing workload per thread
