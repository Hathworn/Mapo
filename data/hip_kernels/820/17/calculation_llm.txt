```
// Consider coalesced access to global memory for improved throughput
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure shared memory utilization matches the available capacity of each block
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads() to prevent unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Avoid control flow divergence within each warp for improved performance
