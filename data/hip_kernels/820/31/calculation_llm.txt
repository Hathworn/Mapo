```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by proper padding
// Minimize warp divergence by handling boundary conditions separately
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory before computation
// Use '__syncthreads()' to synchronize threads after loading shared memory
// Optimize constant memory usage for improved performance
