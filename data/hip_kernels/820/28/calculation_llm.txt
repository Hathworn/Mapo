```
// Use shared memory to cache `a` values for reducing global memory accesses
// Minimize memory transaction size by ensuring all threads within a warp access contiguous memory addresses
// Align data structures to 32-byte boundaries for maximum memory coalescing on AMD GPUs
// Prefer restrict keyword for pointers to help compiler optimize memory access
