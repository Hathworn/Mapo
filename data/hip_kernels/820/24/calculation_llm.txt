// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access times.
// Load data into shared memory before computation for better performance.
// Reduce arithmetic operations by simplifying the expression where possible.
// Ensure threads with tid >= vector_size do not execute unnecessary computations.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns where applicable.
