```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Leverage memory coalescing by ensuring a[i], b[i], and c[i] are accessed in a linear pattern.
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores if supported by hardware.
// Align memory allocations to improve data fetch efficiency.
// Ensure kernels are launched with sufficient blocks to cover vector_size.
