// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Align base_index computation to warp size to prevent bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Evaluate using half precision if acceptable for your application to improve throughput
