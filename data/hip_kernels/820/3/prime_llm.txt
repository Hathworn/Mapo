```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for arrays a, b, and c
// Minimize global memory access by reusing data through registers if possible
// Evaluate the benefit of using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers a, b, and c
// Explore loop unrolling to improve performance further
