// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for array 'b'
// Check alignment and data type usage for efficient memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring aligned and padded access
// Optimize boundary condition handling for shared memory load
// Use appropriate synchronization to avoid race conditions
