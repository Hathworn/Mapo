```cpp
// Consider balancing shared memory usage with occupancy benefits.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to avoid thread divergence.
// Ensure memory coalescing by examining the memory access pattern to `a[]`.
// Consider preloading data to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Evaluate the benefit of loading `b[]` into shared memory depending on usage.
// Avoid unnecessary barriers to improve performance.
// Reassess warp divergence, especially in boundary conditions.
