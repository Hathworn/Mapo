```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access when appropriate
// Ensure proper memory alignment for coalesced global memory accesses
// Evaluate the possibility of increasing the block size for better occupancy
// Check if memory access patterns can be further improved by restructuring data layout
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores if applicable
