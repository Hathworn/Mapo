```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data if shared memory is underutilized
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses for FreqData and PowerSpectrum
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if FreqData and PowerSpectrum are aligned
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance performance
// Ensure occupancy is maximized to improve latency hiding
