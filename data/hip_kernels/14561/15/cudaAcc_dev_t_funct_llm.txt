// Consider using float4 or float2 to optimize memory access through coalesced reads and writes.
// Check if shared memory can be leveraged to minimize redundant loads in the threshold checks.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied for operations within the threshold checks.
// Verify if using constant memory for PulseThresh and pulse_display_thresh values can reduce load time.
// Assess the possibility of aligning memory accesses to optimize throughput.
