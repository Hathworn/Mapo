```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for train array to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory for commonly accessed data within the block to minimize global memory accesses
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and increase performance
// Optimize data alignment and ensure w_vect and train are properly aligned for efficient memory access
// Check for bank conflicts and optimize shared memory usage if implemented
