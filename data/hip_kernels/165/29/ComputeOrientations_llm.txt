```
// Consider coalescing global memory access patterns for g_Data
// Ensure data alignment in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize memory access for gauss loading to avoid redundant calculations and improve caching
// Use loop unrolling techniques in the initialization of hist to reduce instruction overhead
// Minimize thread divergence in conditional statements, especially within loops
// Consider replacing atan2f with fast approximate functions if precision allows
// Use warp reduction techniques for histogram reduction to enhance performance
// Optimize the final orientation determination with warp-level operations for efficiency
