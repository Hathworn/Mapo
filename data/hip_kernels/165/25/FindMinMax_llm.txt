```c
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring d_Data[p + ty * width] accesses are contiguous
// Ensure shared memory is effectively utilized by using 128 threads per block
// Reduce unnecessary global memory reads by storing values in shared memory first
// Employ warp shuffle operations to speed up reduction and minimize shared memory usage
// Optimize synchronization by minimizing __syncthreads() calls
// Ensure proper alignment to improve memory access efficiency
// Prefetch data into shared memory for improved access speed
```
