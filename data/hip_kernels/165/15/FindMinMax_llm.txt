```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory addresses.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency.
// Prefetch data to shared memory before computation to hide memory latency.
// Align data access patterns to ensure maximum memory throughput.
// Explore using float4 or other vectorized data types for potential increased memory bandwidth.
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() calls within reduction by organizing thread work optimally.
