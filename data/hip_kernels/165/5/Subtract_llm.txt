```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider tiling techniques to further optimize memory access patterns.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for all loads and stores to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branches within warps to enhance performance.
// Consider using vectorized types to potentially improve memory transfer efficiency.
