```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when reading g_Data to improve memory throughput.
// Consider rearranging the order of threads in the block to access continuous memory locations.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring memory access patterns reduce bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling for the histogram accumulation to optimize performance.
// Consider storing precomputed Gaussian values to reduce recomputation.
// For atan2f calculations, consider approximations if precision trade-off is acceptable.
// Reduce the number of synchronizations when possible to minimize overhead.
