```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_Data1, d_Data2, and d_Data3 to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory is accessed in a coalesced pattern to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate using float4 loads to minimize cache fetch and improve throughput.
// Optimize explicit load-balancing by using warp-synchronous programming whenever possible.
// Minimize branch divergence by avoiding conditions that separate threads within a warp.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by re-organizing shared memory accesses.
