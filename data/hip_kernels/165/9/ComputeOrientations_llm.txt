// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing.
// Load data in contiguous sections to improve memory access patterns.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed their operations before proceeding.
// Optimize reduction with proper loop unrolling and parallel accumulation.
// Employ atomic operations if histograms could be updated by multiple threads. 
// Use mathematical expressions to replace divisions in common subexpressions for improved performance.
