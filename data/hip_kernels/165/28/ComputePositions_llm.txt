// Load values into registers to reduce global memory access for optimized memory usage.
// Simplified index calculation to avoid unnecessary operations.
// Use FMA intrinsics to improve precision and performance in arithmetic operations.
// Consider using shared memory for common data among threads to minimize global memory access.
// Evaluate if __fdividef can be replaced with faster alternatives in cases with known range constraints.
