// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure data with edge conditions are preloaded into shared memory for each thread block.
// Minimize register usage by efficiently using thread block resources.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve memory access patterns.
// Align memory access with warp boundaries to promote coalesced memory transactions.
// Evaluate use of bank conflict-free memory access patterns in shared memory.
// Ensure the kernel is maximizing the occupancy by tuning block size and grid dimensions.
