```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced global memory reads
// Reduce shared memory usage where possible to enhance performance
// Use loop unrolling in computations to increase execution efficiency
// Implement use of __restrict__ keyword to exploit memory access patterns
// Consider increasing the block size to enhance occupancy
