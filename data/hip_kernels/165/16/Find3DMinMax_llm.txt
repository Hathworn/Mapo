```
// Use shared memory to store data for coalesced memory access and reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure all shared memory accesses are properly aligned and coalesced
// Prefetch boundary elements for efficient memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads complete operations on shared data before next phase
// Perform data reduction in parallel to minimize warp divergence
// Use vectorized operations for min/max calculations to optimize throughput
// Consider leveraging available warp shuffles for further performance gains if applicable
// Minimize use of thread synchronizations to reduce overhead
