// Use shared memory instead of malloc for better performance
// Initialize local histogram in shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads to ensure all threads have completed writing to shared memory
// Optimize memory accesses by reducing global memory writes in the reduction phase
// Ensure data coherence by synchronizing threads before updating global memory
