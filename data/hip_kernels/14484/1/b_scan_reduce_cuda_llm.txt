```c
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads and writes
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve latency
// Minimize if condition checks inside loop for better performance
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure memory alignment for efficient memory transactions
```
