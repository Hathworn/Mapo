```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning input data properly
// Minimize global memory access by utilizing shared memory effectively
// Use __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions between threads
// Utilize loop unrolling for the reduction process if blockDim.x is a compile-time constant
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy and performance, if possible
// Ensure proper handling for edge cases when nb is not a multiple of blockDim.x
