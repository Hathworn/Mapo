```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure Proper alignment of data in shared memory.
// Use atomic operations in shared memory where possible.
// Ensure coalesced accesses to global memory.
// Reduce the frequency of __syncthreads() if feasible.
// Minimize global memory writes by using shared memory.
