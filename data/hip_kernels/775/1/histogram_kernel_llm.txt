```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to DeviceData for better memory read efficiency.
// Ensure shared memory is optimally utilized and there are no bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if reducing the usage of atomic operations could lead to performance improvements.
// Consider splitting the workload more evenly across threads to avoid load imbalance.
// Ensure global memory atomic operations (PartialHist updates) do not become a bottleneck.
// Explore using warp-level primitives for increased performance when aggregating shared memory data.
