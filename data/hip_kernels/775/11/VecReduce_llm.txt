```
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for g_idata to improve memory throughput
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to potentially reduce synchronization overhead
// Explore using double buffering or thread block striding to enhance shared memory utilization
// Ensure memory writes to g_odata are aligned to reduce traffic and latency
// Investigate the use of local memory to hold intermediate results for further performance gains
// Profile different block sizes to find optimal performance given hardware constraints
// Analyze potential bank conflicts in shared memory access and adjust stride accordingly
