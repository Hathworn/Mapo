```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing Mtr in a stride-1 pattern
// Consider using shared memory to store reusable Mtr values for improved performance
// Optimize loop: unroll for potential performance gain
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring all threads in a warp process the loop
```
