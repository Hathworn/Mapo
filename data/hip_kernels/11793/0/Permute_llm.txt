```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store data for reducing memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures to cache line sizes.
// Avoid divergent branches by ensuring condition checks are uniform across threads.
// Minimize use of global memory and prefer local variables where applicable.
// Investigate async data transfers and compute overlaps to hide memory latency.
