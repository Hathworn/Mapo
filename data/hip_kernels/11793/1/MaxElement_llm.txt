```
// Cache frequently accessed values in registers to reduce global memory access
// Use shared memory if possible to store intermediate results for threads in a block
// Consider coalescing global memory access for optimizing bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate loop unrolling for pipelining to improve throughput
// Inline small functions if not automatically done by the compiler to reduce overhead
