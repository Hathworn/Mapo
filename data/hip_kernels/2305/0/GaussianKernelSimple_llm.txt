```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store the filter matrix for faster access by all threads.
// Preload the input data block into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Implement boundary checking to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.
// Optimize the loop by minimizing the arithmetic operations inside the nested loops.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting the data access pattern of src and dst arrays.
// Consider increasing the block size if the occupancy is low to improve kernel performance.
// Use texture memory for the input data if it provides better memory bandwidth.
