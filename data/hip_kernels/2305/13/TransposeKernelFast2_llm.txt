// Unroll the loop to reduce instruction overhead and increase ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed data transfer to shared memory before proceeding.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by padding with extra 4 columns.
// For coalesced memory access, ensure threads in the same warp access consecutive memory locations.
