```
// Optimize: Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize: Consider increasing block size for more efficient usage of shared memory
// Optimize: Load data into shared memory in coalesced manner
// Optimize: Ensure optimal occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size
// Optimize: Minimize use of atomic operations by reducing partial sums first in shared memory
