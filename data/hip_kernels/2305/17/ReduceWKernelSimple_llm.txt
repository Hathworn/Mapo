// Avoid unnecessary recomputation of index within loops for improved memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing contiguous elements in memory
// Reduce global memory accesses by using shared memory if possible
// Utilize warp divergence reduction techniques for better performance
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead
