// Use shared memory to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure shared memory allocation has a padding to avoid bank conflicts.
// Read from global to shared memory in a coalesced manner.
// Perform transpose in shared memory to minimize global memory transactions.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before data is used.
