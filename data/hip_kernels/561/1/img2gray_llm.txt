// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access for imageInput and imageOutput arrays.
// Ensure that the memory access is aligned, which may help in optimizing memory transactions.
// Utilize shared memory for cache optimization if computations or data reuse patterns justify its use for intermediate results.
