// Avoid unnecessary computations by checking index bounds in the loop
// Consider using shared memory for faster access compared to global memory
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts and maximize coalesced access
// Reuse register variables to store frequently accessed data to reduce memory bandwidth consumption
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve performance
// Ensure enough threads are launched to keep the GPU fully occupied
// Consider using warp-level operations for further optimization
