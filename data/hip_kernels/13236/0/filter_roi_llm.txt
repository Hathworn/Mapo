```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures
// Try to minimize divergent branches in the kernel
// Consider using float data type if applicable for more efficient computations
// Investigate launching with optimal block and grid sizes for specific hardware
