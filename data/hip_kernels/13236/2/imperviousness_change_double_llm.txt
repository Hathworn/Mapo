// Consider improving memory access patterns to increase coalescing of global memory accesses
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant accesses to global memory
// Evaluate thread block size to improve warp utilization and reduce potential for divergent warps
// Ensure kernel launch configurations maximize occupancy for the given device architecture
