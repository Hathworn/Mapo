```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data structures to improve coalesced memory accesses
// Consider using memory access patterns to increase cache hit rate
// Minimize thread divergence for better warp execution efficiency
// Optimize block and grid size for the hardware architecture
