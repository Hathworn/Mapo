```
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning shared memory index calculations
// Consider using more optimal block size based on GPU architecture
// Minimize shared memory use by optimizing shared data storage and access patterns
// Explore potential use of vectorized loads/stores to maximize memory throughput
// Ensure data alignment for float arrays to prevent punitive memory fetches
// Assess the potential for register pressure reduction through better index handling
