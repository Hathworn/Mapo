```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when loading indices
// Ensure float4 data structures are aligned for optimal access
// Consider shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory loads
// Minimize data transfer by loading the indices only once
// Optimize register usage to avoid excessive register spilling
// Use warp-level operations if data dependencies allow
```
