// Consider using coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Prefetch input data into registers to minimize repeated shared memory access
// Optionally use double buffering technique for shared memory to overlap computation and data movement
// Assess use of shared memory for potential bank conflict and optimize accordingly if needed
