```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider reducing divergent branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Ensure enough threads are used to fully occupy the GPU and improve memory throughput.
```
