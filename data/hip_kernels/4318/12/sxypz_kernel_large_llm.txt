```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache x, y, z data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses by aligning data accesses for x, y, z, and result arrays.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve compiler optimizations by indicating no aliasing.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by choosing an appropriate block size based on the GPU architecture.
