// Consider memory coalescing for better memory access patterns
// Minimize the use of global memory and prefer shared memory when possible
// Ensure that all threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations
// Align memory allocations to 128-byte boundaries to maximize throughput
// Utilize __restrict__ qualifiers to avoid pointer aliasing issues
