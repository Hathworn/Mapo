```c
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory load efficiency.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access.
// Unroll loops in the reduction step to improve instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used after each memory operation to prevent race conditions.
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block size and shared memory usage.
