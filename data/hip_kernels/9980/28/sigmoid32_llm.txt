```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive elements where possible
// Minimize divergent branching for better warp efficiency
// Favor shared memory usage to reduce global memory latency if applicable
// Avoid atomic operations within this kernel for better performance
// Consider loop unrolling if appropriate for large arrays
```
