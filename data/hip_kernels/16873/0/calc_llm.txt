```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache data for reducing global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for loading data into shared memory.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance.
// Avoid bank conflicts by properly striding accesses to shared memory.
// Optimize use of registers to avoid spilling variables to local memory.
// Minimize use of __syncthreads to reduce synchronizing overhead.
// Consider use of float2 or float4 for vectorized operations on points and results.
// Precompute expressions like sqr(dt) outside the loop if reused multiple times.
