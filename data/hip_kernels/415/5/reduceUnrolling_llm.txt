```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access during reduction.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Utilize warp-level primitives if available to optimize reduction further.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to leverage memory bandwidth effectively.
