```
// Consider using __restrict__ to improve memory access patterns.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for optimal bandwidth utilization.
// Check if shared memory can be utilized to reduce global memory access.
// Consider aligning g_idata and g_odata for coalesced access.
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous copy to hide memory latency.
