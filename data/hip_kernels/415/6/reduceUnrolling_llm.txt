// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate sums to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use warp shuffle operations for in-warp reduction to eliminate the need for __syncthreads().
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance when loading from global memory.
// Use atomic operations instead of __syncthreads() for synchronization when possible.
