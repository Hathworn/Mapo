```c
// Consider using shared memory to store partial sums to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses to warp boundaries.
// Minimize divergence by avoiding conditional statements within warp execution paths.
// Use __shfl_down_sync effectively to reduce shared memory usage and improve performance.
