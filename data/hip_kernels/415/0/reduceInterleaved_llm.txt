```c
// Use pinned memory to improve memory transfer speed between host and device.
// Consider using warp shuffles to further optimize intra-block communication.
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() after reducing bank conflicts.
// Consider using atomic operations if reduction is the bottleneck.
