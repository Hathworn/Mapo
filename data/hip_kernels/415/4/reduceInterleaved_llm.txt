// Consider coalesced access for global memory to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase efficiency.
// Ensure data alignment for optimized memory access patterns.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads participate equally.
// Reuse data loaded into registers to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
