```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase performance
// Boundary checks prevent unnecessary global memory access
// Implement loop unrolling to minimize __syncthreads overhead after each step
// Exploit warp-level primitives to reduce __syncthreads calls
// Store intermediate results in shared memory for faster atomic operations
// Use volatile keyword to prevent compiler optimization issues in warp unrolling
// Reduce global memory writes by storing partial sums in shared memory
