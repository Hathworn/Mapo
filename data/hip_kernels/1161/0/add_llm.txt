```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize coalesced access
// Prefetch data to registers before use for faster access
// Ensure kernel occupancy is maximized by tuning block and grid sizes
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reductions or shared computations
