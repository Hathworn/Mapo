```c
// Optimize shared memory size to fit within the limits of the target GPU.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Load data into shared memory using a blocking pattern to maximize efficiency.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls by grouping independent calculations.
// Minimize the frequency array initialization by reusing it across different threads.
// Consider limiting the size of the frequency array to the required channel values.
