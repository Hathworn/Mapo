```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Load data in a coalesced manner to maximize memory throughput
// Consider using the __ldg intrinsic for read-only data in global memory
// Optimize shared memory bank conflicts by aligning data accesses
// Use loop unrolling for better performance during reduction
// Ensure occupancy by configuring block and grid sizes appropriately
// Experiment with different loop unrolling factors for the block-level reduction
