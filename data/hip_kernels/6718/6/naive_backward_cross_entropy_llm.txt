```
// Use shared memory for data that is accessed multiple times within the block
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Check if data pre-fetching can be implemented to hide memory latency
// Evaluate if the loop unrolling might lead to performance gains
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target architecture
