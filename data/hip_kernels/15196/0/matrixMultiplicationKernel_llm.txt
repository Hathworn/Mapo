```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory coalescing for loading A and B matrices
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access for sharedA and sharedB
// Prefetch data into shared memory to overlap computation and data movement
// Thread block size should maximize occupancy while considering register usage
