// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to optimize memory bandwidth
// Try combining multiple memory accesses into coalesced access patterns for better performance
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for increased throughput
