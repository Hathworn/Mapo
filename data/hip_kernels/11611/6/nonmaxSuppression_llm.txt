// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use texture memory or constant memory for read-only data accessed by all threads to improve cache hit rates.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads in the same warp follow similar execution paths where possible.
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts and improve coalesced accesses.
