```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if the kernel is extended
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns in the future kernel implementations
// Minimize bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Evaluate the kernel's occupancy and optimize block size if additional logic is added
