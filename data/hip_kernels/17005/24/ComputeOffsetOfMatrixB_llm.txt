```
// Use shared memory to cache row_sum[blockIdx.x] to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for both input and output arrays
// Ensure N is a multiple of blockDim.x for efficient memory access and avoid conditional branches
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for the specific hardware being used to maximize occupancy
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
