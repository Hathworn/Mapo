```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring each thread accesses consecutive elements.
// Use shared memory to cache col_sum if there's data reuse within the block.
// Check if loop unrolling is applicable to further enhance performance.
// Ensure the grid and block size configuration maximizes occupancy while minimizing warp divergence.
