```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning hiprandState array properly.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for state pointer to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Consider adjusting block size to optimize the number of threads per block for better performance.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
