// Optimize for coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory.
// Consider using warp-level primitives or atomic operations to reduce syncthreads overhead.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads primarily follow the same execution path.
// Use block-wide reduction in shared memory to optimize for shared memory bandwidth.
