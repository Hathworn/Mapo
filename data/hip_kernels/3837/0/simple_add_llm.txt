```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data allocations
// Consider padding arrays if necessary to maintain memory alignment
// Minimize conditionals inside loop for potential performance improvement
// Evaluate use of shared memory for commonly accessed data
// Investigate potential benefits of loop unrolling
