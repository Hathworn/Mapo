// Use shared memory to cache input vector for faster access
// Ensure synchronization of threads after loading shared memory
// Minimize condition checks within loops for efficiency
// Optimize loop bounds and access patterns for better memory coalescing
// Reduce synchronization overhead by optimizing data access patterns
