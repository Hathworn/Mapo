// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses, especially for 'p_dist' within each thread block.
// Minimize divergent branches within warp for the selection sort process.
// Ensure aligned memory access patterns to maximize throughput.
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations for finding minimum.
