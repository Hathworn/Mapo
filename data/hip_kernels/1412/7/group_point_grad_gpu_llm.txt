```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for grad_out and grad_points.
// Avoid atomic operations where possible by optimizing reduction strategy.
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance in the innermost loop.
// Consider using warp shuffle functions to reduce reliance on atomic operations.
