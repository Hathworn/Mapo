// Consider further reducing global memory access by caching xyz1 data in shared memory
// Optimize loop unrolling for xyz1 data accesses to potentially improve performance
// Evaluate use of atomic operations if conflicts arise in pts_cnt assignment
// Investigate warp-level primitives to optimize syncthreads usage
// Consider splitting large kernels to ensure better resource utilization
