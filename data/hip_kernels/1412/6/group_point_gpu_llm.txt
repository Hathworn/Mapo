// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access for points data.
// Minimize the number of accesses to idx by loading it into registers.
// Consider loop unrolling for loops iterating over nsample and c for reduced overhead.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal bandwidth utilization.
