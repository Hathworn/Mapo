```
// Utilize shared memory to store frequently accessed data for reduced global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for 'probs' to improve bandwidth utilization
// Apply loop unrolling to 'for' loop to minimize loop overhead and enhance pipelining
// Leverage warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of manual loop to decrease execution time
// Optimize register usage by reducing unnecessary variable declarations
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding or restructuring data
// Maximize occupancy by tuning grid and block dimensions for optimal resource usage
