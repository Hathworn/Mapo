```
// Consider using shared memory if the accuracy value is shared across multiple blocks to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure that the value of N is loaded efficiently, potentially using constant memory if applicable.
// If the accuracy variable is frequently updated, consider using atomic operations or reducing at the block level.
// For larger datasets, ensure that kernel launch parameters are maximizing occupancy and bandwidth.
