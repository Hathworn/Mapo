// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize reduction phase further.
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Investigate padding shared memory to prevent bank conflicts during reduction.
// Ensure block size is optimized for target GPU architecture for best occupancy.
// Utilize CUDA streams if multiple kernels are involved to overlap computation and data transfers.
