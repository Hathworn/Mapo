```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same path.
// Evaluate whether shared memory could be utilized for additional optimization opportunities.
// Assess whether loop unrolling could provide performance benefits for larger data sets.
// Monitor the usage of registers and shared memory for potential optimizations.
