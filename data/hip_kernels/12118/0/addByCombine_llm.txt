// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and thread indices
// Minimize conditionals within the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations for increased throughput
// Assess occupancy and adjust block size to maximize GPU resource utilization
