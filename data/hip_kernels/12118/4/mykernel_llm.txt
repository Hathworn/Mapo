```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure data is aligned for optimal memory transactions
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements
// Prefetch data into shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Utilize register usage efficiently to reduce memory fetch cycles
