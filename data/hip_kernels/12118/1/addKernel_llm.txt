// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses as threads within a block can share data.
// Explore memory coalescing techniques to improve the performance of memory accesses.
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are optimized to fully utilize the hardware, particularly focusing on occupancy and execution efficiency.
