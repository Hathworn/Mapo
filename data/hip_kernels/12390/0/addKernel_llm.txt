```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly
// Minimize shared memory usage for better resource distribution
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by checking memory indices
// Use warp aggregation to reduce synchronization overhead
// Favor arithmetic operations over memory operations when possible
```
