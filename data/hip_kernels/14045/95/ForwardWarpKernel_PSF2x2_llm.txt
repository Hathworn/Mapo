// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Precompute flow_row_offset and image_row_offset outside the main loop for efficiency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring access patterns match warp execution.
// Evaluate if arithmetic operations within the kernel can be minimized or reused.
// Use atomic operations judiciously to minimize potential performance bottlenecks.
// Assess if float precision is sufficient or if half precision can be employed.
