```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures or using shared memory.
// Minimize global memory access by caching data in registers.
// Reduce stride access patterns by restructuring data layout if possible.
// Ensure kernel launch parameters are optimized for occupancy and resource utilization.
