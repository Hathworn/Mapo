// Consider using shared memory to store row_sum and col_sum for faster access within a block
// Coalesce memory accesses to output array to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Use loop unrolling if possible to improve instruction throughput
// Ensure all threads within a block have completed accessing row_sum and col_sum before using their values
