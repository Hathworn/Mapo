```
// Consolidate repeated index calculations and reduce using shared memory if beneficial
// Fuse kernel operations to reduce global memory accesses for X, U, and Y
// Optimize memory access patterns to utilize coalesced memory accesses
// Explore usage of __ldg() for L1Weight, if constants are seldom changed
// Consider loop unrolling for the iterations over nFilts
