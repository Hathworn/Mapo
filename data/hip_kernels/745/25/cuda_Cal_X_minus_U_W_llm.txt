```
// Calculate global index only once to reduce redundant calculations
// Use registers for temporary variables to optimize memory access
// Minimize the calculation steps inside the if condition to improve execution efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing Y, U, and X[index] in consecutive threads
