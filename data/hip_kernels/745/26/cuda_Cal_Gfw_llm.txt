```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for Grf and Gcf arrays
// Consider using shared memory for Grf and Gcf to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize arithmetic operations within the if-statement for reduced instruction count
// Align data types on 128-bit boundaries for optimized memory throughput
