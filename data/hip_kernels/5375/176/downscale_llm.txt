```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce access latency.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better performance.
// Minimize divergent branches for efficient execution.
