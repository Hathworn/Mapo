```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and enhance data reuse
// Employ unrolling to increase instruction throughput and improve performance
// Ensure boundary checks prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Align shared memory accesses to benefit from memory coalescing
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before reading from shared memory
```
