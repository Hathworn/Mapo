// Eliminate redundant calculations and improve register usage by combining variables
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer to potentially improve memory access performance
// Consider using shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread and block configuration for better memory coalescing
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for improved performance
