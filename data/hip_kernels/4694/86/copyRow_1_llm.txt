```
// Consider using shared memory in cases where it can benefit tiled operations
// Ensure memory coalescing to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to help the compiler with aliasing assumptions
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for better performance
// Launch kernels with optimal block size to maximize occupancy
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
