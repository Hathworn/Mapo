// Ensure using coalesced memory access for improved performance
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use full occupancy of threads per block to maximize efficiency
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better warp utilization
// Prefer memory access patterns that minimize bank conflicts
