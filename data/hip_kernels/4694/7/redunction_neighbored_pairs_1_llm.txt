```cpp
// Ensure gid is within bounds for safety and to prevent undefined behavior
// Simplify loop to reduce warp divergence and increase efficiency
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and increase speed
// Use __syncthreads to ensure memory consistency across threads
// Conditionally write to temp only if tid is 0 to reduce unnecessary writes
```
