// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data structures accordingly
// Utilize shared memory for data reuse within the block to minimize global memory access
// Consider memory alignment to improve memory access efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by proper memory padding or access patterns
