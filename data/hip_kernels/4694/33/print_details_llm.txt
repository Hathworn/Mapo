```cpp
// Use shared memory when possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize the use of printf in kernels as it can slow down execution
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Optimize the launch configuration for maximum occupancy and performance
