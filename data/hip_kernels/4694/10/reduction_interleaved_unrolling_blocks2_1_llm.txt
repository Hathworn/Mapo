```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access
// Load elements in a coalesced manner to improve memory bandwidth
// Perform computation in shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Use interleaved addressing to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Utilize unrolling within shared memory to reduce synchronization overhead
// Write only the block result to global memory to reduce global memory writes
