```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by adjusting data layout
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used appropriately to avoid race conditions
// Ensure memory access patterns are strided to utilize memory coalescing
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by reusing data in shared memory
// Consider optimizing block and grid configuration for better performance
