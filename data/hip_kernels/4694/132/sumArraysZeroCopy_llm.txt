```
// Consider aligning data access with memory coalescing to improve efficiency.
// Ensure the shared memory size does not exceed the hardware limit.
// Use a loop unrolling technique to optimize computations if the pattern allows.
// Consider using pinned host memory for A, B, and C to improve data transfer rates.
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized to avoid bank conflicts.
// Double-check thread block size for optimal occupancy and performance.
