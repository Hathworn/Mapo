```
// Ensure all threads in a block are used before writing final results to global memory
// Reduce divergence by ensuring warp-synchronized operations
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads and writes wherever possible
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts during data access
// Use fewer synchronization points to reduce overhead if possible
