// Consider using shared memory for frequent/repeated access to input data within a block
// Use memory coalescing to improve memory access efficiency for `input` array
// Evaluate if printf can be conditional based on gid range for reduced overhead
// Consider avoiding printf in performance-critical sections unless necessary
