```
// Align memory accesses where possible to reduce misaligned penalties
// Use shared memory if data reuse is possible to minimize global memory accesses
// Consolidate memory accesses to leverage coalesced transactions
// Prefetch data if applicable to hide global memory latency
// Consider loop unrolling for deeper levels to further reduce loop overhead
