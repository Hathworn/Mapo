```
// Ensure global memory access patterns are coalesced
// Minimize warp divergence by keeping threads within a warp executing similar paths
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Align data structures for better performance on current hardware architectures
// Explore using vectorized data types to transfer data more efficiently
