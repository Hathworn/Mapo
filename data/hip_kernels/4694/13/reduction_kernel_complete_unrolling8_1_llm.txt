```
// Use shared memory to increase data locality and reduce global memory access.
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency by overlapping computation and data transfer.
// Coalesce memory accesses to maximize memory throughput.
// Unroll loops completely to minimize the loop overhead and increase parallel execution.
// Consider using atomic operations to avoid __syncthreads overhead in some cases.
// Use warp-level operations to reduce execution divergence and improve efficiency.
