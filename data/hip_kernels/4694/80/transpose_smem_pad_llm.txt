// Consider coalesced memory access while loading data into shared memory
// Use padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Ensure global memory access pattern is coalesced for output
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data
// Check boundary conditions to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
