```
// Ensure the offset does not cause misalignment that affects coalesced memory accesses
// Consider pre-loading offsets in shared memory for improved access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring warp-wide boundary checks
// Use memory at aligned addresses for optimal coalescing and performance
