```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve read efficiency from global memory
// Unroll the loop to increase instruction throughput and reduce loop overhead
// Ensure the boundary check is outside the loop to minimize conditional checks
// Align memory accesses to ensure optimal coalescing on the device
