// Optimize memory access by coalescing global reads using unrolling techniques.
// Reduce bank conflicts by aligning memory access patterns in shared memory.
// Use warp-level primitives to further optimize reduction operations.
// Minimize conditional statements within loops to enhance branch prediction efficiency.
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
