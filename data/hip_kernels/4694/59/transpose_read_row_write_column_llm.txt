```
// Use shared memory to improve data locality and reduce global memory access latency
// Consider tiling the matrix to optimize memory access patterns further
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures appropriately
// Evaluate the potential benefits of using memory access strategies like cache prefetch
