```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize thread divergence within warps to increase execution efficiency.
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching to hide memory latency.
