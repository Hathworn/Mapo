```cpp
// Ensure input and output matrices are aligned for memory coalescing
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize block and grid sizes for better occupancy and performance
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize further
```
