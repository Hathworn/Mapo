```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize divergent branches within warps for increased execution efficiency.
// Use the __restrict__ keyword for pointers if applicable to provide the compiler with additional optimization opportunities.
// Ensure that gid calculations leverage compiler optimizations by verifying that the constants are powers of two.
