```
// Consider vectorizing data loads to coalesce memory access
// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate results for reduction
// Apply loop unrolling to improve computation throughput
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads within a block
// Ensure reduction is efficient by optimizing the shared memory usage
// Perform warp-level reduction with volatile to ensure correct results
// Reduce branch divergence in reduction loop
