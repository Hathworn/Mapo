// Consider aligning memory accesses for a[i] and b[i] to coalesce global memory access.
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize the stride-based loop execution.
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits for scalability.
// Use atomic operations if needed to ensure correctness in parallel reduction.
