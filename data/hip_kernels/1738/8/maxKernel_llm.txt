```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses by storing partial results
// Ensure maximum memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a strided manner
// Utilize shared memory reduction to minimize synchronization and memory traffic
// Unroll the final warp-level reduction for better performance within a warp
