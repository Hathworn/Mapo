```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory to improve data locality and reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize branching by restructuring if-else logic
// Evaluate use of loop unrolling for the k loop to enhance performance
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce memory transactions within a warp
