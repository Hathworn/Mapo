```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory utilization
// Ensure all threads contribute in parallel reduction to minimize thread divergence
// Leverage loop unrolling to increase throughput in inner loops
// Align data to 128 bytes if possible to utilize memory coalescing
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by considering block size and shared memory usage
