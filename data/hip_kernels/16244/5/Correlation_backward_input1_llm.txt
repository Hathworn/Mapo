```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to minimize global memory accesses
// Utilize loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Leverage warp-level parallelism for efficiency by minimizing divergence
// Employ pre-computation of indices for reduced computational complexity within loops
// Ensure thread synchronization to prevent race conditions when using shared memory
// Consider increasing block size if GPU resources allow to improve load balancing
// Apply conditional checks before accessing arrays to prevent out-of-bounds errors
// Reduce redundant boundary checks by calculating effective index limits outside loops
