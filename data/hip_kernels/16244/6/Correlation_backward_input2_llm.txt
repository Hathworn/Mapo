```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing.
// Use __restrict__ on input pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if possible to further optimize memory access.
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives to reduce shared memory usage.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limitations.
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to optimize occupancy.
// Conduct analysis to evaluate the impact of bank conflicts in shared memory.
