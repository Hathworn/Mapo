```
// Consider using memory coalescing for accessing gradOutput to improve memory throughput.
// Using __restrict__ pointers for input and output pointers to help with compiler optimizations.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring prod_sum array size does not exceed required memory.
// Minimize use of shared memory synchronization with warp shuffle operations.
// Use loop unrolling techniques to optimize the inner loops for accessing gradOutput.
// Explore L1 caching options if applicable for repeated accesses to common data.
// Ensure that warp-level reduction operations are using full warp lanes effectively.
// Evaluate prefetching strategy for rInput2 to reduce memory latency.
