```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for rInput1 and rInput2.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Apply loop unrolling for inner loops to enhance performance.
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal memory access within loops.
