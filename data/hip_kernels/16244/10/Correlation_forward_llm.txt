```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Consider using memory prefetching to hide memory latency
// Minimize redundant calculations within the innermost loops
// Use shared memory more efficiently by limiting usage to necessary data
// Avoid bank conflicts by carefully structuring shared memory accesses
// Ensure all global memory accesses are aligned to avoid penalties
// Consider using texture memory if spatial locality in access patterns is high
// Optimize reduction step using loop unrolling to enhance performance
