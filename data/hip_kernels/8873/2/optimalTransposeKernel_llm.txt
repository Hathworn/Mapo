```
// Consider reducing bank conflicts in shared memory access by transposing the shared memory usage
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by appropriately aligning global load/store
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide global memory latency
// Use loop unrolling to maximize register usage and minimize loop overhead
// Align kernel launch configuration to hardware specifics for optimal occupancy
// Utilize __syncthreads() efficiently to ensure proper synchronization and avoid unnecessary waits
