```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for the array x
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses
// Optimize shared memory usage for threads with varying accesses
// Use atomic operations to manage simultaneous memory updates safely
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads to avoid data hazards
```
