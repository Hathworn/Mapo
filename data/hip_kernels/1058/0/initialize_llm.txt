```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for float arrays a, oA, x
// Minimize memory access by storing totalSize / n in a variable
// Consider using shared memory if accessing totalSize is causing a bottleneck
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of warp size for better efficiency
```
