```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access times
// Implement grid-stride loops for load balancing across threads
// Avoid redundant calculations to optimize execution efficiency
// Ensure shared memory usage is within capacity to leverage fast memory access
// Manage thread synchronization to prevent data hazards and ensure consistency
