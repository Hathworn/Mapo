```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'a' and 'oA' arrays.
// Minimize shared memory usage; consider using registers if possible.
// Use loop unrolling on for-loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Consider double buffering to hide global memory latency.
// Align data in memory to avoid misalignment penalties.
// Avoid shared data bank conflicts by proper memory access patterns.
// Avoid unnecessary repeated calculations inside the loop.
// Use `__builtin_expect` to guide branch prediction effectively.
