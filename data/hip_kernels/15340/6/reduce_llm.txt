// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure that shared memory size does not exceed the block limit
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved bandwidth
// Use loop unrolling for better performance where possible
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by reducing them to one per block
