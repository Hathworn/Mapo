```
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal and does not lead to bank conflicts.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to enhance efficiency.
// Explore using float4 or int4 to load/store data to utilize memory bandwidth fully.
// Evaluate the grid size to balance parallelism and workload distribution.
// Consider memory prefetching to hide latency and improve performance.
