```cpp
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced by using sequential threads
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within the block is applicable
// Evaluate if using float4 data type could provide alignment and performance benefits
// Access memory in a continuous fashion to leverage DRAM burst capabilities
// Review if loop unrolling can increase computational throughput for this operation
