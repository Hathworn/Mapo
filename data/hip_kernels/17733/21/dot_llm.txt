```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for arrays a and b
// Optimize loop unrolling factor based on specific use case and hardware capabilities
// Ensure optimal utilization of shared memory by considering occupancy and bank conflicts
// Analyze block size and grid size for best performance on target hardware
// Review reduction algorithm to ensure minimal thread divergence
