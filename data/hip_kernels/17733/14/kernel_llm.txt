// Avoid redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in registers.
// Minimize global memory accesses by computing the grey value once and using it for all channels.
// Optimize memory access pattern by ensuring coalesced writes to global memory.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce latency when feasible.
