// Use shared memory to minimize global memory atomic operations  
// Initialize shared histogram before main computation  
// Calculate stride to ensure even distribution of memory accesses  
// Accumulate in shared memory to reduce contention  
// Use atomic operations only during final aggregation into global memory
