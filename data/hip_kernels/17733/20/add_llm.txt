// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in memory
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory access
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Consider warp-level primitives for better memory access patterns
// Minimize data dependency within a single thread block
