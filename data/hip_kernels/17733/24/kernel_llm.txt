```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access.
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads in the same warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Avoid divergent branches within warp execution for better performance.
// Utilize constant memory for constants that are repeatedly accessed by all threads.
