// Optimize: Use blockDim.x and threadIdx.x to calculate tid more explicitly
// Optimize: Ensure memory coalescing by aligning array accesses
// Optimize: Load data into shared memory for faster access, if applicable
// Optimize: Prefer using __restrict__ pointers if data won't alias
// Optimize: Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage
