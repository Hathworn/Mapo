```cpp
// Increase cache utilization by reducing boundary checks to only the edges
// Pre-load shared memory to minimize latency during data access
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce performance bottlenecks
// Reuse intermediate values in calculations to minimize repeated computation
// Reduce the number of min and max calculations by leveraging shared memory
// Minimize synchronization overhead by structuring code logic to minimize waits
// Align memory accesses to coalesce reads and writes where possible
// Ensure shared memory arrays have minimal padding to reduce shared memory bank conflicts
