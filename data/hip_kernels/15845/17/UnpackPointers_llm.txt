```
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring data alignment when accessing shared memory
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses
// Reduce warp divergence by optimizing conditional branches in the critical path
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved throughput and reduced latency
// Utilize loop unrolling for minimizing loop overhead and enhancing performance
