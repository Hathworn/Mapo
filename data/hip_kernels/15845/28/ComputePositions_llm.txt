// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like g_Data2 and g_Data3.
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers to reduce latency.
// Minimize divergent branches for warp efficiency when calculating step increment.
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning memory reads to improve coalescing.
