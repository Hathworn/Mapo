```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses whenever possible.
// Ensure memory alignment by using memory access patterns that avoid unaligned data.
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts.
// Consider using constant memory for frequently used values like 'i2sigma2'.
// Profile the code to determine if warp-level parallelism can be improved.
// Assess if loop unrolling can provide performance benefits by reducing loop overhead.
