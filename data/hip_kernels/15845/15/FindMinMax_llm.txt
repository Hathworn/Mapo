```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading d_Data
// Avoid warp divergence by minimizing conditional statements
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize the number of times __syncthreads() is called
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance in reduction phase
// Align memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Store results in registers whenever possible to reduce shared memory usage
```
