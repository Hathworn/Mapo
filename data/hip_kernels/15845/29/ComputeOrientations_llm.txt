```
// Optimize memory access by using coalesced memory access patterns for shared memory loading
// Consider loop unrolling for the initial histogram and Gaussian calculations for performance gain
// Shared memory usage can be further optimized by reducing the scope of shared arrays where possible
// Ensure bank conflicts are minimized in shared memory accesses
// Evaluate potential benefits of using warp shuffle instructions for reductions instead of __syncthreads
// Restructure data loads and computations to improve data locality and reuse
// Consider using texture cache for `g_Data` if this data structure has spatial locality
// Review the use of shared memory to ensure optimal occupancy and resource utilization
