```
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses, which are slower.
// Leverage the atomicAdd function to handle concurrent modifications of shared variables.
// Consider unrolling the loops to enhance performance in the inner loop computations.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed the operations before proceeding.
// Optimize shared memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts.
// Reduce the number of branches and ensure coalesced access patterns in memory operations.
// Evaluate the use of constant memory for frequently accessed values like Gaussian weights.
