// Consider using shared memory for caching blocks of data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly
// Minimize global memory transactions through data reuse strategies
// Investigate the potential of using asynchronous memory copy functions for better data transfer efficiency
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to increase parallel execution
