```c
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage to maximize occupancy
// Leverage memory coalescing by ensuring all threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use constant memory for kernel coefficients to speed up access
// Reduce memory bank conflicts in shared memory by understanding memory layout
// Check load balancing among threads for efficient use of computation resources
// Investigate potential for loop unrolling in the accumulation loop
