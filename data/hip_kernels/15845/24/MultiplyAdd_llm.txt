```
// Use shared memory to cache d_Data and reduce global memory access
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by adjusting data layout
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() if there are no dependencies between threads
// Use 2D thread blocks for better spatial locality and caching
// Optimize the block size to fully utilize the GPU's computational resources
