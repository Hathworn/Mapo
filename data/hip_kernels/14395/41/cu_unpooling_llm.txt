```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.
// Ensure memory coalescing by checking if memory access patterns are contiguous for threads.
// Minimize thread divergence by optimizing conditional statements.
// Investigate using warp-level operations for further optimization in memory access and calculations.
