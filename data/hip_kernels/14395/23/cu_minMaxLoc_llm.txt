```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store cache arrays to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize loading of boundary condition with shared memory to avoid redundant global memory fetches.
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction instead of block-wide synchronization for faster convergence.
// Handle blocks dynamically to balance workload if possible.
// Utilize vectorized memory accesses where feasible for better memory throughput on coalesced memory access patterns.
