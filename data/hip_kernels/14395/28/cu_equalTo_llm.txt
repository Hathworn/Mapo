```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce access latency from global memory
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Explore using __ldg() intrinsic for reading src if it is read-only and improves caching
// Align src and dst pointers to enhance memory coalescing
