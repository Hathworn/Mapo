```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for repeated data
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory latency
// Balance the use of registers and shared memory to avoid spilling
// Explore using warp shuffling for reducing shared memory dependency
