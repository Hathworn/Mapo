```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning threads with contiguous memory segments
// Minimize memory access latency by prefetching data if applicable
// Consider using shared memory if there's any potential data reuse
// Check if computation-to-memory access ratio can be improved
// Optimize block size to match the hardware's warp size for better performance
