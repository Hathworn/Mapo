```
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Consider coalescing memory access for src and dst arrays to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure memory accesses are properly aligned to lower access latency
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for data reuse to further reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp execution efficiency
