```
// Use a common pattern that calculates only within bounds to avoid unneeded checks
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data within a block occur
// Reduce global memory transactions by reusing data in registers whenever possible
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reductions or collective operations
