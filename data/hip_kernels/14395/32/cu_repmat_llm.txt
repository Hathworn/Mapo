```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access when possible.
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory throughput.
// Optimize thread block size to achieve maximum occupancy and efficiency.
// Consider vectorized accesses when dealing with contiguous memory blocks.
