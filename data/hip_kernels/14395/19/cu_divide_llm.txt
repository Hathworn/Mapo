```
// Use grid stride loop to enhance parallelism and memory access efficiency
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced by processing contiguous elements
// Minimize branch divergence by avoiding conditional statements inside loop
// Use __fdividef for fast division when precision is not a concern
