```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads from global memory
// Consider increasing the block size to improve occupancy and performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword cautiously for proper compiler optimizations
// Explore using shared memory if appropriate for reducing global memory accesses
// Evaluate using warp shuffle operations for reducing redundant memory accesses
// Ensure kernel configuration (block and grid size) is optimal for the target GPU
