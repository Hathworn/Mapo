```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for src and dst
// Use shared memory to optimize data reuse patterns
// Increase block size to improve occupancy and hide memory latency
// Ensure that pad calculation is performed outside the loop
// Prefetch data to registers to decrease global memory accesses
