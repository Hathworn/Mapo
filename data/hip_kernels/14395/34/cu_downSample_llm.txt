```
// Use shared memory to cache src data for improved memory access patterns.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
// Consider coalesced memory access for src to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Prefetch data when possible to hide memory latency and improve performance.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve efficiency.
// Explore using vectorized operations for copying data if supported by the hardware.
