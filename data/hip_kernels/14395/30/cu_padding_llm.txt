```
// Use shared memory to improve data access patterns and reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses when reading from src and writing to dst
// Ensure alignment of data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider using asynchronous data transfers for overlapping computation and memory operations
// Reduce arithmetic operations inside kernel by calculating padding offset once before the loop
