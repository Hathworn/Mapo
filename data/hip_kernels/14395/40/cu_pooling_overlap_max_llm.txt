```
// Consider using shared memory to cache src data blocks to reduce global memory accesses
// Explore coalesced memory pattern for the src array access to improve memory access efficiency
// Use loop unrolling techniques in the nested loops for reduced overhead
// Consider maximizing occupancy by selecting an optimal block size that utilizes GPU resources effectively
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
