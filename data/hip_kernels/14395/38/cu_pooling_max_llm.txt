```
// Consider using shared memory to cache src elements for coalesced access patterns
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Ensure that stride between accesses minimizes bank conflicts
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize occupancy and reduce wasted computations
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency
// Use loop unrolling where possible to reduce loop overhead
```
