```
// Use shared memory to cache src data if there's data reuse
// Use __ldg() to improve memory access if src is read-only
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal occupancy
// Experiment with different grid configurations
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring uniform control flow
// Coalesce memory accesses for improved throughput
