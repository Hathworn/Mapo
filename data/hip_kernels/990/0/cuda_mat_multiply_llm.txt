```c
// Consider using a loop unrolling technique within the computation loop to enhance performance
// Ensure data in shared memory is accessed in a coalesced pattern for optimal throughput
// Verify tile size is optimal for the target GPU architecture and adjust if necessary
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used efficiently to minimize idle thread moments
// Consider adjusting block size to better fit the GPU multiprocessors to maximize occupancy
