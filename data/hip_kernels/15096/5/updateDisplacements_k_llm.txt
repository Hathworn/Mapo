```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to Fi for improved memory throughput
// Preload ABC, Ui_t, and Ui_tminusdt into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Reduce the number of conditional checks in the loop unrolling by ensuring maxNumForces is a multiple of 4
// Ensure memory access patterns for Ri are coalesced for better performance
// Consider the use of warp shuffles instead of separate variable accumulation for force components
