```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to improve memory access optimization
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for loading M[me_idx] to enhance memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling or other techniques if the kernel launch configuration allows for it
// Utilize shared memory if calculations can be shared across threads within a block to reduce global memory access
