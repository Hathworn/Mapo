// Use shared memory to load data for efficient reuse and reduced global memory access.
// Ensure boundary checks to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.
// Precompute Gaussian values to save computation time within the kernel.
// Optimize reduction of histograms by minimizing synchronization overhead.
// Utilize a tree-like reduction method to efficiently compute histogram values.
// Apply a smoothing weighted sum to improve response accuracy.
// Use mathematical operations to determine orientation with maximum response.
