```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced access patterns to global memory wherever possible
// Reduce redundant calculations within shared memory utilization
// Consider using loop unrolling for the convolution operation to improve efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize shared memory access between threads
// Utilize symmetry in kernel operations to lower arithmetic computations
