```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize coalesced access
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure that all threads participate in data loading to maximize throughput
// Combine min/max evaluations to minimize number of instructions and avoid redundant calculations
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease overhead of branch instructions
// Minimize divergence within warps for better execution efficiency
// Ensure memory access is within bounds to prevent data race and undefined behavior
```
