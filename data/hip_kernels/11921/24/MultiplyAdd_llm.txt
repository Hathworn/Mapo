```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and performance
// Use register keyword or shared memory to cache d_ConstantA and d_ConstantB if they are accessed repeatedly
// Minimize the use of if statements within the kernel to enhance performance
