```
// Use shared memory to coalesce global memory access and improve memory access speed.
// Adjust the block size to ensure better occupancy and optimal use of GPU resources.
// Consider using the __restrict__ qualifier to indicate that pointers do not alias for better compiler optimization.
// Experiment with loop unrolling if accessing consecutive elements for potential performance gain.
// Ensure that the pitch is properly aligned to the memory requirements for better memory throughput.
// Utilize vectorized memory loads and stores if accessing consecutive memory locations for increased efficiency.
