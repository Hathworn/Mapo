```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate if additional shared memory usage can be further reduced for better occupancy.
// Optimize thread synchronization to minimize __syncthreads() overhead when possible.
// Profile memory access patterns to identify potential bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Ensure memory access patterns maximize L2 cache usage for frequently accessed data.
