```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data for reduced global memory reads
// Pre-fetch global memory data into local registers when possible to minimize latency
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced to optimize memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable to improve performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper memory alignment
// Minimize divergent branching within the warp when checking conditions
// Evaluate if reducing precision from float to half is applicable to gain performance
