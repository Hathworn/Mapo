```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory access by processing consecutive elements together.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads within the block.
// Experiment with loop unrolling to further enhance memory access patterns.
// Ensure that the grid and block sizes are chosen to minimize bank conflicts.
// Explore using wider vector types for reading and storing data to enhance throughput.
