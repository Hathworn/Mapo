```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_Data1 and d_Data2 for improved performance
// Ensure d_Result, d_Data1, and d_Data2 are aligned to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure contiguous memory reads
// Verify if texture or surface memory can be utilized for frequently accessed data
// Evaluate if shared memory could be used to reduce global memory access latency
