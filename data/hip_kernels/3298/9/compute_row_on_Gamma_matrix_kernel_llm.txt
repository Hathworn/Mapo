```
// Use shared memory for storing indices to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce memory accesses for exp_V by assigning l as consecutive indices
// Prefetch N_ptr elements to cache if size permits, reducing repeated access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for operation on row_ptr to increase throughput
