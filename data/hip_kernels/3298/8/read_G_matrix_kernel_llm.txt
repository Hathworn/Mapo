```
// Pre-fetch i_idx, j_idx, exp_val, and bennett_cond to reduce global memory access
// Combine multiple conditional checks into fewer operations to optimize branching
// Use pre-computed delta within the if block to avoid redundant calculation
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce repeated access to global memory
// Align memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access for higher bandwidth
