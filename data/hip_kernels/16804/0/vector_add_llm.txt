// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures with warp size
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within the warp
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce overhead and improve performance
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths per thread block
