```
// Use shared memory and loop unrolling for optimization
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all data is loaded before computations
// Consider using const memory for readonly parts of the kernel
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Try using vector types for memory operations to enhance throughput
