// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access for threads in a warp   
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate values for faster access  
// Use loop unrolling techniques to reduce overhead in pixel processing  
// Align input and output arrays to ensure optimal memory access patterns
