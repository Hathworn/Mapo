```
// Consider using shared memory to store sub-matrices to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to enhance memory coalescing.
// Use asynchronous memory transfers to overlap data movement with computation.
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput.
// Ensure kernel launch configurations are optimized for occupancy.
