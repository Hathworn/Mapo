```c
// Optimize coalesced global memory access by aligning data structures accordingly
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by properly padding shared memory 
// Unroll inner loops for better performance by leveraging compiler optimizations
// Utilize fast memory (shared memory) whenever possible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure all threads in a block are executing concurrently by avoiding thread divergence 
// Use float4 data type for loading multiple floats from global memory if applicable
```
