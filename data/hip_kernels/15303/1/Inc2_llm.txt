```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize the number of global memory writes by accumulating results in registers
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal memory throughput
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enhance performance
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better synchronization efficiency
