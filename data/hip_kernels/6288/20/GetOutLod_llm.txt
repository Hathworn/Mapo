```
// Optimize memory access by utilizing shared memory if possible
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer arguments to improve compiler optimizations
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for in_lod and out_lod0 arrays
// Evaluate potential benefits of using vectorized loads and stores
// Minimize divergence in the warp by ensuring the condition affects entire warps consistently
