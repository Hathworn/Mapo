```
// Consider using shared memory to cache matrix[k * N + j] within each block for improved access speed.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for the matrix pointer to potentially help the compiler with optimizations.
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring warp-aligned thread execution when checking boundaries.
// Increase the number of threads per block to maximize occupancy if the current configuration allows.
