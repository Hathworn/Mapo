// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for in1 and out arrays
// Evaluate the need for shared memory depending on the size of in0 and cnt
// Use __restrict__ more effectively if pointer aliasing is not expected
// Profile to ensure shared memory usage brings performance gains
// Consider using larger block sizes for better occupancy
