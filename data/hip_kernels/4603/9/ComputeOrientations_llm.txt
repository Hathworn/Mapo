```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when loading data to shared memory.
// Consider using a warp-wise reduction for histogram bin combination.
// Implement loop unrolling in loops that combine histogram bins for potential performance gain.
// Use atomics efficiently to minimize serialization in histogram updates.
// Consider preloading frequently used values into registers to reduce global memory accesses.
// Leverage shared memory bank conflict avoidance techniques if necessary.
