```
// Consider using wider memory accesses to enhance coalesced reads from d_Data.
// Potential use of float4 for accessing d_Data for improving memory throughput.
// Ensure data alignment for float4 or float2 loading if utilizing vectorized loads.
// Minimize shared memory usage by reducing the array size if warp-level reductions are feasible.
// Unroll the reduction loop for improved performance if the warp size allows.
// Evaluate the benefit of using warp-level primitives for reductions.
