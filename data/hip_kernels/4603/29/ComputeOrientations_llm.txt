```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access times
// Load data into shared memory efficiently with coalesced access
// Ensure boundary checks when loading data to avoid out-of-bounds errors
// Precompute constant values outside of loops where possible to save computation
// Use fast intrinsic functions (e.g., __sinf, __cosf) for trigonometric calculations
// Replace division with multiplication by reciprocal for performance improvement
// Unroll loops where feasible to reduce loop overhead
// Use warp-level reductions for efficient parallel reduction
// Employ thread collaboration for sorting and reducing operations
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by accessing memory in a pattern that avoids conflicts
