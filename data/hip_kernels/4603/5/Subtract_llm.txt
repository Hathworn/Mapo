// Use shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory access  
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations  
// Optimize boundary checks and index calculations  
// Consider loop unrolling for further performance improvements  
// Use constant memory for small frequently used data arrays  
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring threads follow similar execution paths
