```c
// Consider using a more efficient memory layout to improve coalesced memory access.
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal to reduce potential bank conflicts.
// Optimize boundary checks and clamp operations to minimize branch divergence.
// Use faster approximations for mathematical functions where precision allows.
