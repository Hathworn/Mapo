```
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve cache utilization
// Load neighboring memory locations in a coalesced manner
// Use shared memory to store repeatedly accessed global data, if possible
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing threads to handle similar tasks
// Balance workload across threads to prevent bottlenecks due to uneven execution durations
// Pre-calculate repeated expressions to reduce redundant computations
// Consider using intrinsic functions for common mathematical operations to enhance performance
// Ensure data alignment to prevent potential memory access inefficiencies
// Avoid excessive use of branching within the kernel function to maintain execution efficiency
