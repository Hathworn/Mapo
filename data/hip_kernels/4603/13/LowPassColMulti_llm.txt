```
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency
// Utilize shared memory effectively by ensuring sufficient bank conflicts are minimized
// Ensure that data loaded into shared memory avoids unnecessary boundary condition checks
// Optimize thread block size to leverage warp execution in memory reads and writes
// Evaluate and minimize redundant loads into shared memory for better performance
// Align kernel parameters with cache lines to optimize memory transactions
