```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data for warp-level parallelism.
// Utilize asynchronous data transfer to overlap computation and data movement.
// Evaluate using half-precision float if numerical precision permits to save memory.
