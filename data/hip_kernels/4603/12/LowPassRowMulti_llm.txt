```c
// Use shared memory effectively by reducing bank conflicts
// Optimize load and store operations to global memory by coalescing accesses
// Ensure kernel computation favors data locality to minimize global memory access latency
// Utilize appropriate synchronization to prevent data hazards and ensure memory coherence
```
