// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring that memory access patterns align with warp size  
// Cache invariant values like d_ConstantA[0] and d_ConstantB[0] in register space  
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access in cases of redundant data usage  
// Prefer __restrict__ pointers for better compiler optimization  
// Ensure grid and block sizes are optimized for device capability
