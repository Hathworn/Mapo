```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory reads
// Consider using float4 loads to reduce transaction count for data arrays
// Implement loop unrolling for min/max computations to enhance performance
// Ensure memory coalescing by using contiguous reads/writes and aligning data structures
// Optimize warp execution efficiency by aligning operations with warp boundaries
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses to improve throughput 
// Investigate alternative parallel reduction techniques for min/max calculations
