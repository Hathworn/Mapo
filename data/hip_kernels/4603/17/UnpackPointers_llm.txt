```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for ptrs array to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory for the minmax array to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize the loop unrolling strategy for the inner loop to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure that the data is read in the contiguous memory pattern to exploit spatial locality.
