```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for optimal global memory reads.
// Ensure that shared memory usage is minimized to allow more concurrent blocks.
// Ensure that unnecessary bank conflicts in shared memory are avoided.
// Consider unroll loops for potential performance gain when iterating vertically.
// Consider adjusting block size to better utilize GPU resources.
// Ensure data alignment in global memory accesses for efficient read/write.
