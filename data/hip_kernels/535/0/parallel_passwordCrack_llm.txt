```
// Consider reducing the memory footprint by using a smaller data type for newB, if possible.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring memory coalescing for 'd_output' writes.
// Minimize shared memory use by calculating nIter dynamically or utilizing registers.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Avoid divergent branching by restructuring the cracking logic to keep threads within a warp aligned when possible.
// Prefetch data or use read-only data cache for frequently accessed read-only data such as the 'alphabet' array.
