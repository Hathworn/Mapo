```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by accessing consecutive indices
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar control flows
// Use loop unrolling for reducing instruction overhead if applicable
// Pre-fetch data into registers to decrease memory latency
