```cpp
// Consider introducing shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for better memory access efficiency
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses
// Use registers to store frequently accessed data temporarily
// Unroll loops if applicable for better performance
// Optimize calculations and operations to reduce thread divergence
