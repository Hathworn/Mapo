```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding
// Consider using texture memory for cached memory access
// Optimize thread coalescing patterns for memory access
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce branching overhead
// Minimize divergent branching in warp execution
