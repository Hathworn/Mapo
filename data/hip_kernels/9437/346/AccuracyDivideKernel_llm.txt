```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal global memory performance
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to avoid using shared memory and block synchronization
// Verify if reducing precision to half-precision floats could improve performance without loss of accuracy
