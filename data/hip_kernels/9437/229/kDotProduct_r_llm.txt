// Use a register for interim summation to reduce global memory accesses.
// Apply loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and maximize memory throughput.
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and ensure correct reduction.
// Reduce shared memory using a loop for clarity and maintain memory consistency.
