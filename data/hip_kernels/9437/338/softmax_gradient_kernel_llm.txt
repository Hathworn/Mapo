```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for Y, dY, and dX.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for reuse within the block.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target architecture.
// Utilize loop unrolling for maximizing memory throughput.
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses.
// Consider using warp shuffle for the final reduction stage to avoid shared memory bank conflicts.
