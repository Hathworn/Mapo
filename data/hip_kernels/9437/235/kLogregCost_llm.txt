// Consider using shared memory to cache maxProbs to reduce global memory access.  
// Use __logf function for faster computation of logarithms instead of regular log function.  
// Apply loop unrolling in the for-loop to potentially increase warp execution efficiency.  
// Avoid redundant calculations by checking i + 1 < numOut before accessing memory.  
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance.
