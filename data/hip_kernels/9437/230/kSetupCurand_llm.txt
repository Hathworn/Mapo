// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing the state array using calculated unique index 'tidx'
// Consider aligning data structures in memory for better coalescing and reduced bank conflicts
// Evaluate if constant memory for frequently accessed data such as the seed can improve performance
// Explore the use of shared memory if repeated access to common data is involved among threads
