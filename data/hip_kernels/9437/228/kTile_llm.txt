```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for increased efficiency.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Perform unrolling for repetitive computations to enhance performance.
// Minimize warp divergence to optimize GPU execution efficiency.
