```
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to global data
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring data is accessed sequentially
// Explore using vectorized memory access to reduce memory transactions
// Assess usage of __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments
// Utilize memory prefetching to hide latency in data fetching
// Align data structures to cache line size for better cache usage
// Balance the block size to optimize occupancy and avoid warp divergence
