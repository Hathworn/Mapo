```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Check if using warp-level primitives (e.g., shuffle) can further optimize operations
// Analyze occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size for better resource utilization
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead and improve performance
