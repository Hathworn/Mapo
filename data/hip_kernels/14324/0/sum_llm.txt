```cpp
// Use shared memory if repeated access to a subset of global memory is needed
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use as few registers as possible to allow more threads to run concurrently
// Consider loop unrolling if within a loop for additional performance
// Minimize branching within kernel to reduce divergence
// Maximize arithmetic intensity by increasing the number of computations relative to data transfer
