```
// Optimize memory access by coalesced reads
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loop to reduce branch overhead and increase performance
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to minimize synchronization overhead
// Ensure aligned memory access for improved performance
```
