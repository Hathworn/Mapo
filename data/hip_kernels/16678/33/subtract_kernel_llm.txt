```
// Use shared memory to increase memory access speed and reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access for in1 and in2 for better performance
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing frequently used expressions in local variables
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by structuring if conditions to favor the common case
