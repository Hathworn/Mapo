```
// Consider coalesced memory access for i_index and j_index for better global memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to cache exp_Vj if shared memory is available to reduce redundant global memory access
// Prefetch N_ptr and G_ptr to registers for faster access in each thread
// Ensure is_Bennett access is coalesced
// Optimize memory access pattern for result_ptr to ensure coalesced writes
// Evaluate if memory access patterns for N_ptr and G_ptr can be improved for better efficiency
