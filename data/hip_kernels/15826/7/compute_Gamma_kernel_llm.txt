```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for Gamma and other arrays
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed small data like exp_V 
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers
// Prefer staggered memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Load N and G values into shared memory if they are reused multiple times
