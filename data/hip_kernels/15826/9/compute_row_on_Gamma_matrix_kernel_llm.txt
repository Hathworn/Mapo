```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable better compile-time optimizations
// Use shared memory for N_ptr and G_ptr if the access pattern allows to reduce global memory reads
// Align data in exp_V and row_ptr to ensure coalesced memory access by threads
// Experiment with block size settings to fully utilize GPU cores and memory bandwidth
// Unroll loops if applicable to optimize performance further by reducing loop overhead
