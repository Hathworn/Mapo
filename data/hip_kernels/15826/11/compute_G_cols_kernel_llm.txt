```
// Consider coalesced memory access for exp_V_ptr, N_ptr, and G_ptr to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory for inv_exp_diff to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Use loop unrolling for the l loop to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure data alignment for the arrays to utilize efficient memory transactions.
// Prefer constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data like N_c if within hardware limits.
