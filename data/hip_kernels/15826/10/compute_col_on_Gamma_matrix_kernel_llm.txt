```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to improve memory bandwidth
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access for N_ptr and G_ptr
// Prefetch data into registers where possible to reduce global memory latency
// Ensure that col_ptr writes are coalesced to enhance memory throughput
```
