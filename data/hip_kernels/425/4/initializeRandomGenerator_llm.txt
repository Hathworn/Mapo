```
// Ensure memory coalescing when indexing state array
// Utilize shared memory if there are frequent accesses to common data
// Consider reducing global memory accesses by pre-loading data to registers
// Opt for a lower occupancy to reduce pressure on cache and shared memory
// Profile to identify memory bottlenecks and optimize data handling accordingly
// Prioritize alignment in memory access patterns for better throughput
