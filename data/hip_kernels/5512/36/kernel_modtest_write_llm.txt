```
// Optimize memory access by increasing coalescing
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts
// Unroll the loop for better performance
// Use warp-synchronous programming to reduce instruction overhead
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to improve compiler optimizations
// Minimize divergent branching in the second loop
```
