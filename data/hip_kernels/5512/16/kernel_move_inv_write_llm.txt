```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure ptr is aligned to 4 bytes to prevent misaligned memory accesses
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if pattern is used repetitively
// Minimize branching by reordering code to improve warp execution efficiency
// Evaluate if memory access patterns are optimal for cache utilization
// Adjust block size and thread count for optimal occupancy and throughput
```
