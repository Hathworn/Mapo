```
// Avoid uncoalesced memory access for better performance
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory access by ensuring 32-byte alignment
// Consider using texture memory for spatial locality
// Reduce divergent branches for better warp execution
