```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data.
// Optimize for bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Align data structures to improve memory throughput.
// Profile for memory latency and adjust thread block size accordingly.
