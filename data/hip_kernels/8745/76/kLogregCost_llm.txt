```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data sequentially
// Use __restrict__ keyword to aid compiler optimizations if applicable
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within the block
// Prefer __device__ functions for repeated operations to reduce code duplication
// Consider loop unrolling for iterating over numOut if this is known at compile-time
```
