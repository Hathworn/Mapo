// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Store partial sum in register to minimize thread local memory usage.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing continuous memory blocks with threads.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to synchronize shared memory operations.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by appropriate index access patterns.
// Minimize warp divergence when updating shared memory sums.
