```
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce memory latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input arrays Y and dY
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to avoid synchronization overhead
// Utilize warp-level intrinsic operations for reduction
