```
// Avoid using out-of-bounds accesses by ensuring boundary checks
// Use fast math intrinsics for sine and cosine operations for improved performance
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using appropriate data layout or access patterns
// Optimize data transfer between host and device to reduce overhead
