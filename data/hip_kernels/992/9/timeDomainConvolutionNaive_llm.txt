```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Avoid branch divergence to maximize warp efficiency
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize latency
```
