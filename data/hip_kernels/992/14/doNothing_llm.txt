```
// Consider using shared memory if any common data is accessed by multiple threads
// Optimize memory coalescing to improve global memory access patterns
// Evaluate the use of constant memory if applicable for read-only data
// Minimize memory transactions to reduce latency and enhance throughput
// Review kernel block and thread configuration for optimal occupancy
