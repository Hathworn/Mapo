```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for both input and output arrays
// Minimize stride to enhance cache utilization and reduce potential memory latency
// Examine the possibility of using shared memory to further improve data locality
// Investigate warp divergence to optimize thread execution paths
// Consider loop unrolling if there are performance benefits for specific hardware architectures
