```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if applicable
// Coalesce global memory access for better performance
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform execution within warps
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency
// Optimize block size and grid size to achieve maximum occupancy
```
