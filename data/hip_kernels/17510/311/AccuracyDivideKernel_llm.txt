```cpp
// Consider using __shared__ memory for intermediate calculations to optimize memory access.
// Evaluate if the operation needs to be contained within a warp or can be expanded for parallel execution.
// Keep data in registers when possible to reduce global memory access time.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
