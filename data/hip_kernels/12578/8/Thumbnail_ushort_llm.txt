// Consider coalesced global memory writes to the histogram.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Prefetch texture data to shared memory where possible.
// Optimize memory access patterns to leverage texture cache.
// Align memory access patterns with warp size to prevent bank conflicts.
