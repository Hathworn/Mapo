```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for histogram updates.
// Initialize shared memory with zeros to ensure correctness.
// Synchronize threads after initializing shared memory to ensure all updates are completed.
// Perform atomic operations on shared memory to reduce contention on global memory.
// Synchronize threads before merging local histogram back to the global histogram.
// Use atomicAdd on global memory only after reducing contention with shared memory.
