```
// Use texture memory to improve read efficiency and cache performance
// Optimize memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant reads from global memory
// Calculate bilinear interpolation weights outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations
// Minimize the number of tex2D calls by using shared memory or registers
// Ensure destination writes are coalesced by aligning dst_pitch accordingly
