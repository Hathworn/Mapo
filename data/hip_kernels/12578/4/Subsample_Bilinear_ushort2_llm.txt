```
// Pre-compute scale factors to minimize repeated calculations
// Use intrinsic functions to avoid branching and improve performance
// Load texels to take advantage of texture cache for memory access efficiency
// Use integer arithmetic for accumulation to optimize performance
// Store results using coalesced writes for efficient memory access
