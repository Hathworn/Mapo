```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize use of atomic operations by first accumulating values in shared memory
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further reduce synchronization overhead
// Align data structures to cache-line boundaries where possible
// Use texture memory for 2D spatial locality
