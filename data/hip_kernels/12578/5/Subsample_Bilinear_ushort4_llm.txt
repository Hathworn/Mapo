```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Utilize texture memory for better cache performance.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel.
// Ensure arithmetic intensity is maximized to hide memory latency.
