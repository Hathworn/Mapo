```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed texture data to reduce redundant access.
// Precompute scaling factors outside of the kernel where possible to reduce calculations per thread.
// Optimize texture fetches by ensuring memory alignment and access patterns that reduce cache misses.
// Use vectorized data types where possible to enhance coalesced memory access and reduce kernel duration.
// Reuse calculated values and reduce repeated calculations within the kernel to improve performance.
