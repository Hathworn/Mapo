// Use coalesced memory access patterns for g_push_reser and s_push_reser to improve throughput
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by restructuring the algorithm if possible to reduce contention
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to optimize the finish flag update
// Ensure that shared memory usage is aligned to prevent bank conflicts
