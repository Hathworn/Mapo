// Consider using cooperative groups for more efficient synchronization
// Investigate using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize divergent branches by evaluating stochastic values together
// Explore warp-level primitives to reduce atomic operations
// Efficiently manage memory alignment to optimize access patterns
