```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize data transfer by using shared memory to store frequently accessed height values
// Reduce global memory access latency by reading neighboring height values into shared memory at once
// Use atomic operations efficiently to prevent race conditions while minimizing overhead
// Consider warp-level primitives for synchronization to reduce __syncthreads() overhead
// Address memory bandwidth bottlenecks by minimizing redundant global memory accesses
