```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for g_graph_height
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like g_graph_height
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Minimize global memory usage by storing intermediate results in registers
// Ensure g_counter and g_over are accessed using atomic operations to avoid race conditions
