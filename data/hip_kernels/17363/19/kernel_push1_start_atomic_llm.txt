```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for g_graph_height
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp efficiency
// Evaluate if more shared memory can be used to store temporary variables
// Atomic operations can be optimized by reducing contention
