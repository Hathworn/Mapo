```
// Consider reducing global memory accesses by using additional shared memory for more variables
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory transactions
// Check the possibility of using texture memory for read-only data
// Use warp shuffle functions instead of shared memory to reduce __syncthreads() overhead
// Optimize the load/store pattern for g_relabel_mask to minimize redundant writes
// Fuse conditional branches where possible to improve warp execution efficiency
// Implement loop unrolling for any repetitive sections of the code
// Exploit asynchronous memory prefetching for data needed in subsequent operations
// Investigate bank conflicts in shared memory and align accesses to prevent them
// Analyze thread divergence and realign data access patterns to reduce it
