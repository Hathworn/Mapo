// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for height_fn.
// Load neighboring heights conditionally to minimize unnecessary global memory reads.
// Use atomic operations efficiently to handle concurrent access in g_push_reser.
// Efficiently calculate the minimum flow push utilizing the min function.
// Simplified relabel condition to reduce computation overhead.
// Effectively synchronize threads using __syncthreads to ensure proper data sharing in shared memory.
