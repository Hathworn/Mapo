// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory reads and writes.
// Review atomic operations for potential locking issues and overhead reduction.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to improve memory access speed.
// Evaluate vectorization possibilities to take advantage of wider memory transactions.
// Assess the potential benefits of warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization barriers.
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize loop control overhead.
// Validate data locality enhancements to improve cache effectiveness.
// Evaluate the possibility of loading multiple data elements per thread to enhance throughput.
