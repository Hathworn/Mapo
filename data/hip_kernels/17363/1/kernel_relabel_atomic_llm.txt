```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring each thread accesses different banks
// Consider using a larger block size if possible to increase occupancy and hide memory latency
// Use more registers per thread if performance allows, to store frequently accessed variables
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous memory transfers to overlap data transfer and computation
