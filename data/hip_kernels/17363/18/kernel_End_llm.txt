// Ensure coalesced global memory access by using a stride loop
// Minimize divergence by ensuring thread blocks process contiguous memory regions
// Use shared memory if further inter-thread communication is needed
// Ensure that atomics do not become a bottleneck by evaluating parallel reduction alternatives
