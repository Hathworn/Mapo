```
// Optimize memory access pattern for coalesced accesses
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance
// Minimize branching by reordering conditional checks
// Align data structures to improve memory alignment
// Evaluate use of texture memory for optimal caching
// Reduce divergence within warps by restructuring code
// Prefetch data where possible to hide memory latency
