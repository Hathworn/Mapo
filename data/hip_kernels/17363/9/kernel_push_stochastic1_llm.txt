// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory only for data that will be reused within the block.
// Reduce global memory accesses by ensuring all threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Investigate the possibility of using warp shuffle operations to optimize inter-thread communication.
