// Consider using __restrict__ for pointer parameters to improve memory access optimization.
// Explore thread parameter configurations for efficient resource utilization.
// Check for coalesced memory accesses in shared memory operations.
// Review data movement between device memory and shared memory for overlap in kernels.
// Investigate the use of atomic operations further to assess contention and performance impact.
// Evaluate potential benefits from loop unrolling in structured conditions.
// Verify alignment in shared memory allocation for height_fn.
// Analyze ways to minimize branch divergence within thread blocks.
// Consider asynchronous operation compatibility and audit __syncthreads() usage for optimal synchronization.
// Evaluate warp size utilization for calculating thread indices for efficient parallelism.
