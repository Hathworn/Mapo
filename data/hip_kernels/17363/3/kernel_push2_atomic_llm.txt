// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for better memory access efficiency.
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to optimize global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Avoid redundant calculations by computing once and reusing results if needed.
// Minimize atomic operations if possible, as they can serialize performance and increase latency.
// Analyze threads that aren't utilizing shared or global memory effectively and optimize their memory transactions.
