```
// Combine conditional checks into a single statement to reduce branching.
// Use shared memory if possible to cache frequently accessed data like g_push_reser and g_sink_weight.
// Consider aligning g_push_reser, g_sink_weight, and g_graph_height to avoid uncoalesced memory access.
// Use vector types for data like g_graph_height to enhance memory throughput.
// Ensure that g_pixel_mask is aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
