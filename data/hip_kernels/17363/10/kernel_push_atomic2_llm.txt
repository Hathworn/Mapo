```cpp
// Use grid-stride loops to reduce grid launch overhead
// Ensure efficient memory access patterns by accessing memory contiguously
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop for better warp execution efficiency
// Maximize occupancy by carefully choosing block and grid dimensions
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
