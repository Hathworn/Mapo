```
// Consider using shared memory for `s_push_reser` and `g_push_reser` to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure that the memory accesses for `g_terminate` and `d_stochastic` are coalesced.
// Explore using warp-level primitives to further optimize memory access patterns.
// Investigate using loop unrolling if thread calculations can be further simplified.
// Evaluate the benefits of using asynchronous memory copy if `s_push_reser` and `g_push_reser` are large.
