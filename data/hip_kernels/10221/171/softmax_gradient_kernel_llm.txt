```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to cache dY and Y values for each block to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory alignment to improve performance and reduce potential bank conflicts
// Optimize the reduction phase by minimizing divergence among threads in the same warp
// Minimize the number of syncthreads to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism and reduce loop overhead
