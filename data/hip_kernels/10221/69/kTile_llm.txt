```cpp
// Unroll the loop to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Use __restrict__ to help the compiler with aliasing optimizations
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data to warp size to improve memory coalescing
// Use ldc instructions for non-trivial shared to global memory copies
```
