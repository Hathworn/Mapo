```
// Use shared memory for reducing global memory accesses in thread block
// Load data into shared memory to minimize cache misses and improve coalescing
// Consider memory alignment and coalescing for gradOutput_data accesses
// Apply loop unrolling pragmas judiciously based on scale_factor
// Ensure iterative updates reduce write-back operations to global memory
// Leverage warp-level primitives for more efficient parallel accumulation
