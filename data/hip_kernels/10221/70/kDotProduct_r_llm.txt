```c
// Use loop unrolling to improve memory access pattern and reduce loop iterations
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by accessing consecutive elements with consecutive threads
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Apply warp shuffle in parallel reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have written their partial sums
```
