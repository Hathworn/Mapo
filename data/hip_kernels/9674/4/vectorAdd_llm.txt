```
// Minimize shared memory usage if arrays can be coalesced
// Consider unrolling loops to increase computational throughput
// Align data accesses to improve memory coalescing
// Ensure __syncthreads() is only used when necessary
// Investigate if using float4 can improve performance by reducing load/store operations
