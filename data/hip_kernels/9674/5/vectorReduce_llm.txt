```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory reads.
// Ensure that shared memory utilizations are maximized for better performance.
// Minimize divergent branches in the reduction loop for efficient warp execution.
// Reuse loaded shared data as much as possible to reduce global memory traffic.
// Reduce the number of syncthreads() to lower synchronization overhead.
