```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by arranging data in a manner that threads access contiguous memory locations
// Analyze to ensure minimal bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Utilize shared memory if threads within the same block frequently access common data values
// Explore using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if possible to help the compiler with optimizations
