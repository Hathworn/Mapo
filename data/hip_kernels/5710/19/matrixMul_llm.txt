// Reduce register usage by reducing the precision if possible (e.g., float -> half)
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in thread order
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize shared memory load/store patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling for the main computation loop to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Avoid redundant synchronizations and only synchronize when absolutely needed
