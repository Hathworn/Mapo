// Consider using shared memory for Md and Nd to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses for Md and Nd to improve bandwidth utilization
// Optimize loop unrolling for the k-loop to reduce loop overhead
// Explore use of warp shuffle operations for better intra-warp communication efficiency
// Check memory access pattern for potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage
