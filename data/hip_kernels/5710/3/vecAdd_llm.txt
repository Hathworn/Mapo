```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to improve memory access time
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Minimize use of global memory by preferring register storage where possible
// Align data structures to 128 bytes to ensure optimal memory access speed
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
