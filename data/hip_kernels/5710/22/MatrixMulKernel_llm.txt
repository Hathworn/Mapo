// Use coalesced memory access to minimize global memory transaction overhead.
// Consider using adjacent threads to access consecutive memory locations for Md and Nd.
// Explore alternative memory alignment strategies to further reduce bank conflicts.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() where possible to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Investigate increasing block size to potentially increase parallelism and reduce memory latency.
