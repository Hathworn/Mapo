```
// Consider increasing thread block size to maximize occupancy
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for Md and Nd
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Prefetch data to shared memory to hide global memory latency
// Unroll loops to improve instruction throughput
// Use warp-level primitives for optimized parallelism in shared memory
