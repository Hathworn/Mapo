```c
// Consider coalesced global memory access for imagem array to enhance memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory load for frequently accessed image data
// Ensure alignment of imagem array to prevent memory handling inefficiencies
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same path
