```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize repeated global memory accesses for Melement and Nelement
// Ensure coalesced access patterns to global memory for better memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by using padding if needed
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
