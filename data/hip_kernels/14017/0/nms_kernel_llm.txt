```
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access and improve access coalescing
// Ensure the loading into shared memory is done in a coalesced manner for better memory transaction efficiency
// Reduce conditional checks inside loops by minimizing unnecessary computations
// Divide work evenly among threads to avoid thread divergence and improve efficiency
// Optimize the calculation and storage of IoU results by using bitwise operations
// Consider prefetching data if applicable to overlap computation and memory access phases
