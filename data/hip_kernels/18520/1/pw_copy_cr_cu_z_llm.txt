```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache zin values for coalesced access.
// Ensure dout memory is aligned and accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and efficiency.
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.
// Check if using __restrict__ keyword could improve pointer aliasing assumptions.
