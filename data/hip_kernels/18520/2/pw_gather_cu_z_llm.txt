// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential indices access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access for ghatmap values
// Use vectorized operations where possible to reduce instruction count and improve memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for maximum occupancy and parallelism
