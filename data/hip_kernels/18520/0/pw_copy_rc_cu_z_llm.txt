```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalesced memory access for better efficiency.
// Avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory can improve performance.
// Ensure efficient memory alignment to improve access speed.
// Prefetch data to registers when possible to hide memory latency.
