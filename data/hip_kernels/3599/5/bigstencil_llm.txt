```
// Consider larger loop unrolling if the input size allows it for further performance gain
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop for optimal warp execution efficiency
