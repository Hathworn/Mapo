```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Ensure shared memory size does not exceed 48KB per block
// Optimize stride access to shared memory to improve coalescing
// Leverage loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in selection sort
// Consider warp-level primitives for more efficient sorting of small arrays
// Balance between kernel launch configuration and GPU occupancy
