```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for grad_out to improve memory throughput
// Try to optimize the access pattern for grad_points to minimize memory latency
// Evaluate if using shared memory for grad_points can reduce global memory traffic
// Check if loop unrolling benefits outweigh potential increase in register usage
