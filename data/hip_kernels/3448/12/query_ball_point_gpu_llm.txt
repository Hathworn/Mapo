```
// Use shared memory to cache xyz1 for faster access and reduce global memory reads.
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns for xyz1 and xyz2 to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop when accessing xyz1 elements.
// Align data structures in memory to optimize memory access speed.
// Evaluate if using texture memory would benefit read access patterns for xyz1 and xyz2.
