```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Optimize index calculation by reducing operations within the loop to improve performance.
// Ensure proper usage of __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory.
// Consider using loop unrolling for small fixed-size loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize min finding within a warp.
