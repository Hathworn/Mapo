// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Evaluate the usage of texture memory to further optimize read operations for large datasets.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Investigate the possibility of using atomic operations if there are any race conditions in writing to global memory.
