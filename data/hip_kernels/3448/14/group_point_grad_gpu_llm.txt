```
// Load `grad_out` into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use blockIdx.y to improve parallel processing with more grid dimensions
// Utilize grid-stride loop for better occupancy and performance
// Spread workload across z-dimension threads to better utilize GPU resources
// Employ __syncthreads() to ensure shared memory loading is complete before use
// Use atomicAdd to ensure correct accumulation in global memory
