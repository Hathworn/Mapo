// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use warp-level operations to maximize memory coalescing.
// Consider loop unrolling to potentially increase performance.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads enter the same conditional paths when possible.
