```
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing loads from global memory
// Reduce warp divergence in loops by ensuring evenly divisible workload
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve throughput
// Ensure data alignment to achieve optimal global memory access performance
// Use const qualifiers for read-only variables to enable compiler optimizations
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching to hide latency
