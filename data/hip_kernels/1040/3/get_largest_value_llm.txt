```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for vec array
// Minimize use of atomic operations by using shared memory first
// Consider loop unrolling to increase performance if possible
// Optimize memory access by ensuring words are aligned properly
// Check for occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes accordingly
