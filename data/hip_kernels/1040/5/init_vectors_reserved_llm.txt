```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize data movement between host and device to decrease overhead and improve performance
// Merge initialization of vec with kernel launch to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider using vectorized memory access to improve memory throughput, if applicable
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and efficiency in memory access patterns
