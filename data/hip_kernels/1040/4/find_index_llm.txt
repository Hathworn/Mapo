// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures.
// Optimize for shared memory usage to reduce global memory access.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to improve performance.
// Evaluate warp synchronizations around atomic operations.
// Consider using a local memory accumulator before atomicMax to reduce contention.
