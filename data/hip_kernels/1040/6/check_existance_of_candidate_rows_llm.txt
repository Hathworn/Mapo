```
// Use shared memory for 'deleted_rows' and 'row_group' to reduce global memory access
// Use warp-level operations to optimize atomic operations handling
// Consider loop unrolling for iterating over rows in 'check_existance_of_candidate_rows' function
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the scope of variables
// Use cooperative groups for better synchronization and data handling efficiency
