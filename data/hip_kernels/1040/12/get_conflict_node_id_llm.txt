// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize atomic operations or use warp-level primitives for better performance
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for optimizing index calculations
// Evaluate memory access patterns and align memory if possible
// Ensure proper thread synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions
