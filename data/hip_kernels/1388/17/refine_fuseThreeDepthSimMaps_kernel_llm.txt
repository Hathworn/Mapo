```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for faster retrieval
// Load data into shared memory before processing to minimize global memory reads
// Simplified conditional assignments using ternary operations to streamline the code
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when reading from global memory
// Consider reducing the usage of shared memory if register usage is not excessive
