// Improve memory coalescing by restructuring data accesses for masks and values.
// Reduce shared memory usage if the same results can be achieved with lower usage.
// Consider increasing parallelism by adjusting block and thread configurations.
// Optimize condition checks for 'set' to reduce divergence between threads.
