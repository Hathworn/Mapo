```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth
// Align data structures to boundary requirements for better performance
// Use loop unrolling if vector additions are in loops
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for occupancy and resource utilization
