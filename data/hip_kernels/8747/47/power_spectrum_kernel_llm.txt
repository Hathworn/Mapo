```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Use __restrict__ to indicate no aliasing, which can help optimization
// Prefer shared memory if data reuse among threads is required
// Minimize global memory access by loading to registers
// Consider using float4 for vectorized memory access
// Reduce divergence by reorganizing conditional branches
