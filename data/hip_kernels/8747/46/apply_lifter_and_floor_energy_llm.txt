```cpp
// Use blockDim.x for better coalesced memory access in the loop
// Consider reducing the number of __syncthreads calls for performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions if possible
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Optimize the memory access of 'log_energy' and 'lifter_coeffs' for caching
