```
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalesced access.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure data alignment to maximize memory throughput.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to synchronize computation across threads.
// Reduce divergence in the warp by minimizing conditional statements during loops.
