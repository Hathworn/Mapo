```
// Use shared memory to further reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Consider aligning data to reduce misaligned memory accesses
// Try to improve memory coalescing for better memory access patterns
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer arguments to help compiler optimizations
// Explore if using warp-level primitives like __shfl_xor can optimize accumulations
// Profile and determine if occupancy can be improved by adjusting block sizes or shared memory usage
