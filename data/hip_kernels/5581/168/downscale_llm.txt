```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking alignment of gradInput_data.
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for frequent access.
// Consider loop unrolling for the accumulation loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure gradOutput_data is read in a coalesced fashion.
// Use fewer registers by reusing temporary variables.
