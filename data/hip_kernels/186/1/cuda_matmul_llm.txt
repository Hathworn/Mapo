// Use shared memory to store tiles of matrices A and B for improved memory access patterns.
// Ensure shared memory is properly synchronized after loading tiles to prevent race conditions.
// Optimize global memory accesses by coalescing memory reads for matrices A and B.
// Aim to maximize thread utilization by processing blocks of data in parallel.
