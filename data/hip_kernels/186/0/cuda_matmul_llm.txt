```
// Use shared memory to store matrix tiles for better memory access patterns
// Ensure shared memory loads are coalesced to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Synchronize threads after loading to ensure all data is properly staged
// Perform computations on smaller shared memory tiles for better cache utilization
// Synchronize threads after computation to prevent race conditions before next tile load
