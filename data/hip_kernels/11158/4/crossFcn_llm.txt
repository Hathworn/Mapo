```
// Consolidate global memory accesses into fewer transactions
// Minimize the use of device memory in favor of shared memory
// Use uniform memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Prefetch data to shared memory if reused multiple times
// Ensure the warp is active to avoid divergence during branching
