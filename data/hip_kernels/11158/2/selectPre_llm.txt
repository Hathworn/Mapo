```
// Ensure global access is coalesced for improved memory access efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory to store data that threads within the same block use frequently.
// Optimize memory transactions by aligning data structures to cache line boundaries.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Preload data into registers if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
