```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like c_LB and c_UB.
// Optimize the memory access pattern to coalesce memory reads and writes in populationArray.
// Avoid possible performance penalties by restructuring warp divergence in if conditions.
// Consider using local variables for repeated calculations inside the loop.
// Evaluate the efficiency of the random state initialization outside the loop.
