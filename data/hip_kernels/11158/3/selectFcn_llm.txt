```
// Consider coalesced memory access for populationArray and tmpPopulationArray
// Utilize shared memory to store frequently accessed data such as fitness values
// Reduce bank conflicts by padding shared memory if necessary
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization
// Optimize random number generation to reduce variance in execution time
// Consider loop unrolling for the final copying loop to increase efficiency
