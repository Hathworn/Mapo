// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loops to minimize loop overhead
// Employ memory coalescing to increase throughput
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments to prevent aliasing
// Optimize with warp-level parallelism to utilize the full power of GPU
// Implement asynchronous copy of data into shared memory to hide latency
