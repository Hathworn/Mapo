```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse can be identified to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures to memory access patterns
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to exploit caching benefits
// Experiment with different block sizes to find optimal performance configuration
