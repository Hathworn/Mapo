```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory for temporary storage if patterns allow it.
// Reduce global memory accesses within loops if possible.
// Minimize data transfer between host and device.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimal for the architecture.
