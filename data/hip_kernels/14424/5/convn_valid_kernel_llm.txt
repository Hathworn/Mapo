// Consider using smaller blocks to minimize index calculation overhead
// Ensure kernel and data fit within shared memory; adjust shared memory size if necessary
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning kW and kH with block dimensions
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalesced access of sh_data and sh_kernel
// Consider using loop unrolling in sum computation for better performance
// Check if the size of sh_kernel and sh_data can be reduced for memory efficiency
