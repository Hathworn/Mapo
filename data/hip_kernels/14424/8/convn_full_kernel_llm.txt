```
// Optimize the use of shared memory to load only required elements of the kernel.
// Minimize synchronization barriers when accessing shared memory.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the data input to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use block and thread configurations that minimize warp divergence.
