// Consider caching loc_ data in shared memory for repeated access during loop execution
// Optimize memory access by ensuring x and y arrays are aligned and avoid memory bank conflicts
// Use float2 variable to access loc_ instead of short2 to reduce type conversion overhead
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead and increase kernel execution efficiency
