```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory access to 'u' and 'v' for better performance
// Align 'normalization_factor' and 'dst' to avoid bank conflicts
// Use shared memory to cache 'src' values for reuse across threads within a block
// Check if using texture memory for 'src' could improve access latency
// Ensure 'atomicAdd' operations are minimized for higher efficiency
