```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure threads are not diverging in the bounds check to maximize warp efficiency.
// Consider aligning data to ensure optimal access patterns for specific GPU architectures.
// Use appropriate block and grid size configuration to maximize occupancy and minimize memory latency.
