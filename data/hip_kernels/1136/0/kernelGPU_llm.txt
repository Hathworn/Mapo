```
// Consider increasing shared memory size if blockDim.x exceeds 256
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for Rin, Gin, and Bin
// Minimize redundant syncthreads calls inside the reduction loop
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling in the for loop
// Balance the load across threads if L is not a multiple of blockDim.x
