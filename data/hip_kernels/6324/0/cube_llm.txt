```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_in and d_out.
// Ensure d_in and d_out are aligned to improve memory access speeds.
// Use shared memory if there are repeated calculations or data reuse within the block.
// Evaluate occupancy using shared memory and register usage per block.
// Minimize divergent branches for optimal warp execution.
