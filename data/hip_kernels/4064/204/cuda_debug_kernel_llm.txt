```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory addresses.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize divergent branching to maintain warp execution efficiency.
// Use appropriate compiler flags and warp size optimization if needed.
// Check for any potential bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns.
// Opt for asynchronous memory transfers if data dependencies allow.
// Assess the possibility of loop unrolling to improve pipeline utilization.
// Utilize occupancy calculator to ensure optimal resource usage.
// Explore launching multiple smaller kernels instead of one large kernel if beneficial.
// Implement checks and optimizations for memory alignment to boost performance.
