```
// Use dynamic shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Perform first level of reduction with thread coarsening for improved memory access pattern
// Ensure reduction is performed using warp-level synchronization to maximize throughput
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns to global memory
// Use parallel reduction in shared memory to minimize global memory write operations
// Minimize divergence by structuring condition checks effectively within the warp
