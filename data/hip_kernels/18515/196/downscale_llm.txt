```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache gradOutput_data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize thread indexing for better coalesced memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling approaches to enhance performance further.
// Use __restrict__ keyword to potentially aid the compiler with aliasing information.
// Evaluate if reducing the precision of operations improves performance.
