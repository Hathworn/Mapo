```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Only load data into shared memory within bounds to prevent undefined behavior.
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory to ensure all threads have the same view.
// Calculate certainty using shared memory to minimize redundant memory accesses.
// Use efficient arithmetic operations to clamp weights.
