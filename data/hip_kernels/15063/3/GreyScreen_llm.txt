```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize block size and grid size for maximum occupancy and performance
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce access latency
