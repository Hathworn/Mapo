```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently used data such as bias values and reduce repeated global memory access.
// Use vectorized loads from global memory to amortize the cost of memory transactions.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access for improved global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Explore loop unrolling for the accumulation loop to reduce branch overhead and improve performance.
// Align data structures as best as possible to allow for optimal memory transactions.
