```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for d_outputweights
// Precompute id * numHiddenNeurons + keyPress to avoid redundant calculations in the loop
// Minimize repeated access to d_weights by storing its value in a register before the loop
// Leverage loop unrolling to optimize the calculation of totalChange and update of d_weights
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce atomic operations on biasChange
