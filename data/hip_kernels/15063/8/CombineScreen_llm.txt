```c
// Consider unrolling the loop to improve performance
// Use shared memory if there is potential for data reuse to optimize memory accesses
// Minimize global memory accesses and prefer using local or shared memory
// Coalesced memory accesses can improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Explore using float4 or float2 types to perform vectorized operations and improve throughput
```
