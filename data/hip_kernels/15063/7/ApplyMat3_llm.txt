```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure data is coalesced by accessing consecutive memory positions
// Favor using smaller data types or precision if possible for reduced bandwidth
// Consider optimizing thread block size for better occupancy
// Implement loop unrolling for inner loops when relevant
```
