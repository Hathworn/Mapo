```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory access.
// Ensure that input data is aligned to avoid misaligned memory access.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access.
// Minimize redundant calculations of indices in loops for better performance.
// Consider double buffering to overlap computation and data transfer.
