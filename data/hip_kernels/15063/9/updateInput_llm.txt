```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic for frequently accessed data
// Minimize redundant data movements between CPU and GPU
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Use vectorized types for increased memory bandwidth
```
