```cpp
// Ensure coalesced global memory access
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use appropriate grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable
// Use register variables for frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory reads and writes by using shared memory where beneficial
// Avoid unnecessary synchronizations within the kernel
