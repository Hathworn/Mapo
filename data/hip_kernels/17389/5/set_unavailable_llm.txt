```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'idx' array to improve memory access patterns
// Use shared memory if 'n_selected' is small and can fit into shared memory to improve latency
// Optimize the stride access pattern to ensure efficient memory transactions
// Check if 'available[idx[i]]' accesses can be minimized or combined to reduce scattered writes
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure that grid and block dimensions fully utilize the GPU resources
