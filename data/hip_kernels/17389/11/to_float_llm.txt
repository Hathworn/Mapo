```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure the number of threads per block is optimal for the GPU architecture
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel code
// Experiment with loop unrolling for potential latency hiding
```
