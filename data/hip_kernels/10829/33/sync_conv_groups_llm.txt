```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate if shared memory can be used to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use __ldg() to take advantage of GPU's read-only data cache for immutable data.
// Assess if loop unrolling could benefit performance by increasing instruction-level parallelism.
// Determine if using warp-level primitives can reduce the need for explicit synchronization.
