```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing for improved bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergence by optimizing control flow statements
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data
// Ensure memory alignment for improved throughput
```
