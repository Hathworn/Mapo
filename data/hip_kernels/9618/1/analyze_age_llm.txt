```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by arranging data in SOA (Structure of Arrays) format
// Use shared memory if the same data is accessed multiple times by threads within a block
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to 32-bit or 64-bit boundaries
// Minimize divergent branching with warp-uniform conditions
// Experiment with different block sizes for performance tuning
