```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning access patterns to warp size.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency.
// Apply warp-level parallel reduction via shuffle operations for efficient summation.
// Use syncthreads efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Minimize redundant calculations by restructuring the reduction.
