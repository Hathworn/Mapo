```
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to improve memory access.
// Align data in memory to improve coalescing of memory requests.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block.
// Optimize global memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access.
// Check if loop unrolling further can benefit from architecture-specific optimizations.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to cache lines.
