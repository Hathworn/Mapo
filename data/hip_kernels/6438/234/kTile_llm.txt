```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning src and tgt memory addresses
// Use shared memory to cache src data for reuse
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations
// Minimize register usage to increase occupancy
// Use __restrict__ to denote non-aliasing pointers for better optimization
```
