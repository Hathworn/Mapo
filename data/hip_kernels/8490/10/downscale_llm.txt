// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to enhance coalescing.
// Ensure that data accesses are aligned for optimal memory throughput.
// Investigate potential use of shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can further optimize the performance of inner loops.
// Check the possibility of using warp-level primitives for collective operations.
// Analyze if reducing divergence can be achieved by restructuring conditions.
