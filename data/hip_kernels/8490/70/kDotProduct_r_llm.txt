```
// Use a register to accumulate partial sums instead of shared or global memory
// Store the intermediate results in shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Efficient parallel reduction using shared memory to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use block-level accumulation to minimize global writes
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory with continuous threads
