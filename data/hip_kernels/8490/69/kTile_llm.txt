```
// Use shared memory to buffer source data blocks for faster access and minimal global memory access
// Align shared memory access patterns to prevent bank conflicts
// Optimize thread block dimensions to maximize occupancy and coalesced memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for the main computation loops to enhance performance
