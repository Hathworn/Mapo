```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring data is aligned
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize memory latency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could improve performance
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for device
// Minimize launch latency by using fewer blocks if possible
