```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing for improved global memory access patterns
// Align memory accesses to 128-byte boundaries for optimal cache utilization
// Minimize memory divergence by organizing data efficiently
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Apply loop unrolling where applicable to decrease instruction overhead
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access to maximize throughput
```
