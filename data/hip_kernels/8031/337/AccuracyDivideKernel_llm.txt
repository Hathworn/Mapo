// Consider using memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Ensure data is accessed in a coalesced manner to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce frequent global memory accesses
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust kernel launch parameters for optimal performance
// Perform loop unrolling if applicable to increase computational efficiency
