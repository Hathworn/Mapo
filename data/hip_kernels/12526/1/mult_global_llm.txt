```
// Use shared memory to cache A and B submatrices to reduce global memory access
// Employ warp-level primitives for cooperative loading to optimize memory usage
// Check if loop unrolling can benefit the accumulation process by enhancing performance
// Consider using memory coalescing techniques to improve memory access patterns
