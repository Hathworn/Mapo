// Use shared memory to load data in tile sizes to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure synchronization between threads when loading and computing data using __syncthreads().
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to maximize data parallelism and memory coalescing.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory by adjusting array indices if necessary.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing branch overhead.
