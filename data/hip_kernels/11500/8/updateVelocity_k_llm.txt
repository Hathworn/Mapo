```
// Consider coalesced memory access to minimize memory latency by aligning data accesses
// Use shared memory to hold commonly accessed data within a block to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize the loop with loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase arithmetic intensity
// Check for bank conflicts when using shared memory and apply padding if necessary
// Try to minimize divergent execution paths within warps for better performance
// Ensure that data types are aligned properly in memory to avoid misaligned access penalties
// Use float2 instead of individual float accesses to potentially leverage vectorized operations
