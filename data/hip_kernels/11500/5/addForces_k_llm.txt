```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Pre-calculate repeated expressions outside of loops whenever possible to save computation
// Use shared memory to stage data when appropriate to minimize global memory bandwidth
// Vectorize operations when applicable to enhance data processing efficiency
