```
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve access patterns for vx and vy
// Prefetch data into shared memory if occupancy allows to reduce global memory latency
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional checks
// Optimize the computation of kk by avoiding repeated operations
// Use float constants instead of repeatedly casting integers
