```
// Use shared memory for coalesced memory access patterns
// Ensure enough shared memory is allocated per block
// Align the memory access for optimal coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage to reduce overhead
// Experiment with block size for best performance
