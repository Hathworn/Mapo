```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory reads and writes.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads follow the same execution path whenever possible.
// Use shared memory efficiently by reusing it for different operations to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced to minimize memory latency.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns.
