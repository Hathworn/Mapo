// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load data in chunks to minimize latency
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce thread divergence
// Align memory access to avoid bank conflicts
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring threads follow a predictable path
// Optimize loop by unrolling critical sections
