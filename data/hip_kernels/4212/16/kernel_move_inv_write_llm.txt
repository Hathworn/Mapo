```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures to warp boundaries
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if applicable
// Minimize bank conflicts by properly aligning data in shared memory
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for better throughput
