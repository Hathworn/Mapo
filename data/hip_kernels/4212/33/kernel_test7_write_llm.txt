// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning the pointer calculations to match memory transaction sizes
// Consider optimizing memory stride within the loop for better cache utilization
// Leverage shared memory if necessary for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Analyze potential bank conflicts in memory operations for further optimization
