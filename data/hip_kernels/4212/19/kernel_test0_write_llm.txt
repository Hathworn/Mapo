```
// Check bounds before accessing memory to prevent out-of-range access.
// Use pointer arithmetic to set block_end accurately and avoid redundant checks.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads write sequentially in memory.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
