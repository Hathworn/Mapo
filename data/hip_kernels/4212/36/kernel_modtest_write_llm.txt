```
// Consider ensuring coalesced memory access for ptr initialization
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize usage of global memory by initializing shared_block with p2
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory is fully initialized
// Optimize loop to minimize thread divergence when writing p1
// Synchronize threads before writing back to global memory to ensure data consistency
// Coalesced memory access pattern when writing back to global memory
