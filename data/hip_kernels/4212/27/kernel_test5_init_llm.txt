// Consider aligning data accesses to optimize memory transactions
// The use of "#pragma unroll 16" suggests a focus on loop unrolling for improved access patterns
// Evaluate shared memory usage to further reduce global memory accesses where applicable
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to minimize global memory access latency
// Double-check the need for block size granularity for optimizing memory bandwidth
