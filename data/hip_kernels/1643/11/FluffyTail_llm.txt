// Consider using the warp-level intrinsics to reduce atomic operations overhead.
// Attempt using coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth usage.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to decrease divergence among threads.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize conditional checks to enhance control flow efficiency.
// Align memory allocations to improve access speed.
