```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to improve compiler optimizations
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to further optimize parallel performance
// Prefetch Y, dY, and dX values into registers to reduce memory latency
// Increase the granularity of the unroll factor if dimensions are known to be large
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring the smallest possible working set
// Investigate bank conflicts in shared memory and adjust alignment if necessary
