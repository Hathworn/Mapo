// Use loop unrolling to minimize the loop overhead and increase arithmetic intensity
// Ensure optimal data coalescing by accessing elements in contiguous memory locations
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Implement warp-level communication to avoid excessive synchronization barriers
// Balance computation and memory access workloads between threads to avoid idle threads
// Consider using atomic operations for more granular parallel reduction of results
