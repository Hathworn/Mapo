```
// Consider coalescing global memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize register usage by using loop unrolling if applicable
// Consider warp-level primitives for efficient synchronization
// Ensure memory access aligns with memory boundaries for optimal performance
```
