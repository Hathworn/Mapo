```cpp
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within a block is possible
// Use memory coalescing to ensure aligned access patterns
// Optimize for occupancy by selecting an appropriate block size
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could enhance performance
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency
```
