// Ensure data access patterns are coalesced for efficient memory reads
// Optimize dense_data access by aligning and coalescing
// Consider using shared memory for data and dense_data if space allows
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Use loop unrolling in critical sections to reduce instruction overhead
// Implement fmaf to reduce floating-point operation latency
