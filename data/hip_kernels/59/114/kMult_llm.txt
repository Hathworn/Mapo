// Consider using shared memory for a and b to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce redundant memory reads
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and throughput
// Ensure grid size matches or exceeds the number of elements for full utilization
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce cache thrashing
