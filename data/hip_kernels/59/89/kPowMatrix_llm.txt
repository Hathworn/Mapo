```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if the data is reused
// Minimize the number of powf function calls by unrolling loops if applicable
// Ensure the grid and block sizes are optimized for the specific GPU architecture being used
// Consider aligning data structures in memory to improve cache utilization
