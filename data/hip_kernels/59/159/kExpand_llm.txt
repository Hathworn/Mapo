```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads.
// Align memory accesses to ensure coalesced memory patterns.
// Utilize memory access patterns that maximize throughput by reducing bank conflicts.
// Ensure that the use of atomic operations is minimized to improve memory performance.
// Avoid costly divergent branching in conditional statements.
