// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures on 32-byte boundaries.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions, if applicable.
// Consider using asynchronous memory copy to overlap computation and data transfer.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads follow similar execution paths.
