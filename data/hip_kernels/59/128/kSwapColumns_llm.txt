```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Align access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses, enhancing memory throughput
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for improved memory bandwidth utilization
