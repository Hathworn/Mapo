```
// Ensure the shared memory size accounts for the number of threads in the block
// Prefetch data into shared memory in coalesced manner
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores where possible
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to optimize synchronization overhead
// Use __expf for faster single-precision computation compared to exp
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy
