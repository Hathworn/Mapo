```
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize memory bandwidth utilization
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to minimize global memory access
// Ensure aligned memory access for higher throughput
// Experiment with different block sizes to balance between parallelism and memory access efficiency
// Use read-only cache for input 'mat' if GPU architecture supports it
// If possible, minimize divergent branching within warp for better performance
// Evaluate reducing global memory access latency through asynchronous data copying if applicable
