```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits
// Access shared memory once per thread, store in local variables as needed
// Avoid divergent branches within loop
// Unroll loops for performance improvement
// Minimize memory access by reusing loaded data
```
