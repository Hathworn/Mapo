// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed source data within a block
// Align memory accesses to improve coalesced memory access and reduce latency
// Use vectorized data types like float4 to minimize memory transactions and improve bandwidth
// Ensure proper memory alignment to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Optimize stride calculations to prevent unnecessary arithmetic operations inside the loop
