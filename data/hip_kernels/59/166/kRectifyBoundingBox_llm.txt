```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Change memory access patterns to utilize more coalesced memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling if possible to improve performance in the for loop.
// Minimize divergence in the blocks by optimizing control flow.
// Evaluate adjusting blockDim.y to ensure better balance between threads and memory accesses.
// Profile the application to identify additional bottlenecks related to memory utilization.
