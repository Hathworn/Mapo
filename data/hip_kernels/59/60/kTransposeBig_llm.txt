// Precompute height x width to reduce redundant calculations and improve memory access efficiency  
// Use computed indices for efficient memory access, reducing random access pattern impact  
// Consider aligning data to optimize coalesced memory access, especially for large matrices  
// Utilize shared memory if frequent data reuse within block to lower global memory bandwidth usage  
// Minimize bank conflicts by carefully structuring access patterns when using shared memory
