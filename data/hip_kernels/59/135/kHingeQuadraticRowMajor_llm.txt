```
// Consider using shared memory to store part of 'mat' for caching and reducing global memory access.
// Align memory accesses to coalesce them and reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Use const memory for 'margin' if it's not changing frequently during kernel execution.
// Increase memory bus utilization by ensuring memory accesses are contiguous.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could further optimize the inner loop over 'width'.
