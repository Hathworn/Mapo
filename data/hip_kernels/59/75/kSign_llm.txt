```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Optimize block and grid size to maximize memory throughput and thread utilization
// Avoid warp divergence by simplifying conditional logic within threads
