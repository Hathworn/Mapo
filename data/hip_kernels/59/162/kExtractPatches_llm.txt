```
// Use shared memory to minimize repetitive global memory accesses.
// Consider coalesced accesses to global memory when possible.
// Pre-compute repetitive index calculations and store them in registers.
// Ensure optimal block and thread dimensions to maximize GPU occupancy.
// Minimize divergent branching within warp execution to improve performance.
// Check for effective memory alignment on accesses to optimize throughput.
