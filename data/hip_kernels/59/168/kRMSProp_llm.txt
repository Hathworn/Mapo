```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within a block
// Explore loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enhance performance
// Minimize use of sqrt() inside the loop by precomputing outside if possible
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
