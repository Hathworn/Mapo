```
// Consider using shared memory for mat and target arrays to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access to improve performance.
// Examine using const memory for frequently accessed constants like margin to speed up access.
// Ensure data alignment in memory to take full advantage of memory access structures.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust thread/block dimensions for improved parallel efficiency.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to potentially enhance compiler optimizations.
