```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory throughput.
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring accesses are made in a pattern that aligns with memory structure.
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory load.
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase computational throughput.
