```
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous memory read/writes.
// Avoid unnecessary recalculation of thread and block indices.
// Minimize global memory traffic by using shared memory if applicable.
// Consider using __restrict__ to help the compiler with aliasing optimizations.
// Utilize warp-level optimization if the algorithm permits.
