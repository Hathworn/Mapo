// Consider using shared memory for diagonal elements to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with data access patterns.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to match GPU architecture for efficient warp usage.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations if concurrent writes to memory are possible.
