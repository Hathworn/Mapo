```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing memory in a sequential pattern to improve performance.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied to reduce loop overhead and enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Analyze if using half precision can be beneficial for reducing memory bandwidth usage, if precision allows.
// Parallelize across the height dimension if possible, to better utilize GPU resources by increasing warp occupancy.
