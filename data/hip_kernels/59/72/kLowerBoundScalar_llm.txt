```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization
// Experiment with block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and performance
// Check if __restrict__ qualifiers can be used for the mat and target pointers to allow for better compiler optimizations
