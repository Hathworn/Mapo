```
// Reduce pointer arithmetic in inner loop to minimize computation overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Evaluate warp divergence and optimize thread block dimensions
// Synchronization between iterations not needed due to lack of dependencies
