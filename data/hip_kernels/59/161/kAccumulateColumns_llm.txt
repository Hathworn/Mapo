```
// Consider using memory coalescing for global memory access to improve bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to buffer data and reduce global memory traffic.
// Align memory accesses by ensuring the starting address is 32-byte aligned.
// Explore vectorized loads/stores for increasing throughput.
// Evaluate divergent branches to minimize warp divergence.
