```
// Reduce the use of global memory by utilizing shared memory for common read-only data
// Optimize coalesced memory accesses for both reads and writes to global memory
// Implement double buffering technique to overlap computation and memory transfers
// Consider loop unrolling for better latency hiding in critical sections
// Minimize divergent branching to ensure warp efficiency
// Evaluate the thread block configuration for optimal occupancy and workload distribution
// Ensure efficient utilization of registers to reduce pressure on global memory bandwidth
