```
// Consider using dynamic shared memory allocation for varied block sizes
// Minimize memory access by combining reads from global memory when possible
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data for contiguous access
// Evaluate using __ldg for read-only data to exploit cache efficiency
// Reduce __syncthreads usage if possible by valid dependencies removal
