```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading from global memory
// Consider using vectorized memory access for better performance
// Minimize the use of shared memory if not needed for reductions
// Synchronize threads only when necessary to reduce overhead
// Maximize occupancy by choosing appropriate block size
