```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring all threads access contiguous memory addresses.
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to indicate that pointers do not alias,
// potentially allowing for further compiler optimizations.
// Minimize divergent branching by using linear indexing calculations.
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for reduced global memory access.
// Unroll loops to decrease overhead and increase execution efficiency if loop iterations are known at compile time.
// Prefetch data to hide global memory latency by overlapping computation with memory access.
