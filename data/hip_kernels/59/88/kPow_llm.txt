```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing mat and target arrays with stride-1 access pattern
// Use shared memory if mat array elements are reused across threads
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block size
// Align data structures to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Consider using __powf for single-precision performance benefits
