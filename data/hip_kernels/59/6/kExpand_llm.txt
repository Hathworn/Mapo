```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Precompute constants outside the inner loops when possible to enhance performance
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns with warp size
// Apply loop unrolling aggressively where safe to increase throughput
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() if threads are not working on the same data
