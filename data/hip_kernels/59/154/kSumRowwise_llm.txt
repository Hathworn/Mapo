```
// Consider coalesced memory access for the 'mat' array to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement loop unrolling within for loop where each thread processes elements
// Use a warp-level intrinsic for reduction to optimize performance
// Optimize synchronization points to minimize overhead
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block size and using appropriate number of threads
