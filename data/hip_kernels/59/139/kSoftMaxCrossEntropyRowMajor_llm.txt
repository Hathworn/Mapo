```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory access by accessing continuous memory addresses.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring alignment with warp size.
// Utilize shared memory to cache values that are reused by multiple threads.
// Use __shfl_down_sync for inter-thread communication to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure that warp divergence is minimized by restructuring branches or loops.
// Balance the workload among threads to avoid idle threads and ensure high occupancy.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to provide additional compiler hints for optimization.
// Profile the kernel to identify bottlenecks and optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Increase computational intensity by batching multiple operations within the same kernel.
