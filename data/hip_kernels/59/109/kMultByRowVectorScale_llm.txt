```
// Consider using shared memory to temporarily store portions of 'mat' and 'vec' for faster access
// Align memory access for 'mat', 'vec', and 'tgtMat' to reduce memory coalescing issues
// Use vectorized operations for 'mat', 'vec', and 'tgtMat' to improve throughput
// Allocate enough threads to fully utilize GPU resources by adjusting block and grid sizes
