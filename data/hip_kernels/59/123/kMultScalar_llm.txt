```
// Move scale_targets calculation outside the loop to reduce redundant computations
// Utilize shared memory if possible to improve memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data for the GPU's memory architecture
// Consider possible register utilization optimization to reduce shared memory pressure
