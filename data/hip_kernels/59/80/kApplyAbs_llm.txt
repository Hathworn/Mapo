// Consider using shared memory for data reuse and reducing global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns.
// Ensure enough threads are launched to cover the entire data length for parallel execution.
// Evaluate the benefits of loop unrolling for performance enhancement.
// Check the occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes for optimal hardware utilization.
