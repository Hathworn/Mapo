// Consider coalescing memory accesses for higher memory throughput
// Optimize the use of shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data structures to minimize memory access latency
// Explore potential for loop unrolling to increase computational throughput
// Minimize the use of division and modulus operations, especially inside loops
