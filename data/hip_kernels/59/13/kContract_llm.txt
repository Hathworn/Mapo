```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergence in conditional statements to improve warp execution performance.
// Consider loop unrolling further for inner loops to reduce loop control overhead.
// Align data structures and memory accesses for better memory access patterns.
