// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access  
// Ensure memory coalescing by having threads access consecutive elements  
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads follow similar execution paths  
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement if applicable
