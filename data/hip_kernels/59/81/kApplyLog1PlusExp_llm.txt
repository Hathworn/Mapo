```
// Ensure optimal shared memory utilization by limiting blockDim.x to 256 or fewer
// Group memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Pre-load data into registers where possible to reduce shared memory access overhead
// Align mat and target memory pointers to improve global memory coalescing
// Avoid warp divergence by minimizing conditional branches in the kernel
// Use __logf and __expf for enhanced performance through intrinsic functions
