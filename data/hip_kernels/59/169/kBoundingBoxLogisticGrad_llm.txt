```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as bbox and label
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches by grouping warp threads with similar execution paths
// Ensure proper alignment of memory accesses to enable vectorized loads/stores
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and improve ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
