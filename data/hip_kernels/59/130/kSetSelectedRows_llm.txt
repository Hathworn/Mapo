```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory access for source and target data.
// Ensure indices are accessed in a coalesced manner when loading into shared memory.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access.
// Unroll loops further if occupancy allows to reduce loop overhead.
// Consider increasing the block size if registers and shared memory permit for better occupancy.
// Align data structures for optimal memory transactions where possible.
