```
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts by accessing shared memory efficiently.
// Consider increasing thread block size for better occupancy.
// Unroll loops if applicable to improve instruction throughput.
