```
// Use shared memory to cache mat1 and mat2 arrays for better memory access patterns
// Align memory accesses for both mat1 and mat2 to improve coalesced memory access
// Consider using texture memory for mat1 and mat2 to optimize read performance
// Use loop unrolling if len is large for better performance
