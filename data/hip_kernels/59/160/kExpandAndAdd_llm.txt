```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for source, mat, and target arrays.
// Consider employing loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Use read-only data cache for constant data in the kernel.
