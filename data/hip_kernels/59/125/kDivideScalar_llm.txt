```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider using a larger block size if the GPU supports more threads per block to improve occupancy
// Profile memory usage and kernel execution to identify any potential bottlenecks
