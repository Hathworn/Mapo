```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if mat1, mat2, and target are guaranteed not to alias
// Align memory addresses of mat1, mat2, and target to improve coalesced memory access
// Consider using float4 or float2 to load/store data for increased memory throughput
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on hardware specifications for occupancy
// Ensure sufficient occupancy to hide memory latency and achieve better performance
