```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Align COPY_BLOCK_SIZE with warp size to optimize memory access patterns
// Add padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Ensure global memory access is coalesced by following a linear access pattern
// Consider splitting the kernel if COPY_BLOCK_SIZE becomes too large to handle within shared memory limits
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads complete data loading before writing to global memory
