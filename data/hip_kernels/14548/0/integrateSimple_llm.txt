```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access by storing intermediate sums
// Ensure efficient memory coalescing when accessing global memory to improve throughput
// Maximize warp utilization by processing consecutive data chunks within a loop
// Minimize divergences within warps by ensuring uniform loop iterations
// Utilize atomic operations for accumulating results across blocks safely
// Avoid excessive synchronization by limiting __syncthreads to necessary points
