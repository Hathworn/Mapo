```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to indicate pointers do not alias
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory if multiple threads need to access same data
// Minimize use of global memory operations within the kernel
// Evaluate if atomics are needed if there are concurrent accesses
