```c
// Ensure shared memory is sufficiently utilized for coalesced access.
// Minimize the number of atomic operations for better performance.
// Use persistent threads for load balancing in the frontier expansion.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to increase throughput.
// Align data types and memory accesses to prevent bank conflicts.
// Explore memory prefetching techniques for the next iteration's accesses.
// Balance workload by distributing the copy operations evenly across threads.
