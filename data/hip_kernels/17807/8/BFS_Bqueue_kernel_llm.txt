```c
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Minimize global memory access by caching data in shared memory.
// Use atomic operations efficiently to avoid unnecessary contention.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory wherever possible.
// Use syncthreads judiciously to synchronize shared memory usage.
// Limit shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Reduce the number of atomic operations by using shared memory buffers.
// Balance load among threads to maximize parallel efficiency.
// Consider using padding to prevent shared memory bank conflicts.
