```
// Consider coalesced memory access for edges and dest arrays
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Reduce global memory access by caching visited array in shared memory
// Optimize atomic operations by reducing contention
// Employ half-warp optimizations for p_frontier and c_frontier accesses
// Consider using warp-level primitives for efficient synchronization
// Align data structures to avoid unaligned memory access penalties
