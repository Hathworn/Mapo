```
// Consider increasing the block size to improve occupancy
// Use a separate loop for loading data into shared memory outside the main loop to reduce redundant operations
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access
// Implement double buffering in shared memory to overlap computation and data movement
// Evaluate using texture memory for improved cache performance
