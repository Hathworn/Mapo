```
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize threads and block layout to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
// Confirm alignment of memory allocations to improve memory access speeds
