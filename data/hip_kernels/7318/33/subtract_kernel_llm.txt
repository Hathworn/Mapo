```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory patterns.
// Use shared memory if there are frequent accesses to the same data.
// Reduce global memory accesses by minimizing redundant reads.
// Try loop unrolling if appropriate for the problem size.
// Ensure threads do not access out of bounds memory locations.
