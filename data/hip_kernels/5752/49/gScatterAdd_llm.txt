```
// Use shared memory for sparse indices to minimize global memory access
// Load data into shared memory in a coalesced manner if possible
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data before proceeding
// Place condition checks to avoid unnecessary branching
// Consider loop unrolling if indices are accessed in a predictable pattern
// Ensure the atomic operation is essential to prevent write conflicts
