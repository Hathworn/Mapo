```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory if applicable
// Evaluate if atomic operations can be replaced to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider loop unrolling if there are iterative operations within the kernel
// Profile kernel launches to check for occupancy bottlenecks
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to aid compiler optimizations
