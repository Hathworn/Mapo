```
// Use shared memory to cache data for coalesced global memory access.
// Try vectorized loads and stores for improved memory throughput.
// Improve memory access patterns to ensure warp-wise coalesced accesses.
// Optimize register usage to reduce variable spilling to global memory.
// Consider occupancy tuning by adjusting block size based on resource usage.
