```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that thread synchronization is necessary; excessive barriers can slow performance
// Evaluate the need for multiple syncthreads to reduce their usage
// Optimize warp shuffle operations; check if shuffling can be minimized
// Assess if boundary checks can be minimized or removed for performance
