```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive elements.
// Utilize warp-based operations to minimize divergence.
// Experiment with loop unrolling for potential performance gains.
// Align data to ensure coalesced memory patterns.
