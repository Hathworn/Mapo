```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for 'vel' to optimize memory transactions
// Ensure that 'velmod' is allocated in a coalesced manner to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider using shared memory if 'vel' data will be reused among threads
// Check memory alignment for 'vel' and 'velmod' to avoid misaligned access penalties
```
