// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access bottlenecks.
// Consider memory coalescing for better memory access patterns and improve performance.
// Minimize arithmetic operations by reusing precomputed values where possible.
// Explore potential loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase throughput.
