```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed global memory data like ftoomega and ftovel.
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements in ftoforces array.
// Use constant memory for read-only data accessed by all threads, like simulate2d and dt, to reduce global memory access.
