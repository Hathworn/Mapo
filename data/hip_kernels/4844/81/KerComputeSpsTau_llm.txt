```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for gradvelff when multiple threads access nearby indices to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate the possibility of using texture memory for velrhop to improve read performance.
// Experiment with loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Assess the benefit of increasing block size to have more threads and optimize occupancy.
