```
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access adjacent elements frequently
// Check for memory coalescing to optimize access patterns
// Evaluate the impact of L2 cache usage to improve access latency
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable to reduce pointer aliasing overhead
// Verify alignment of float3 structures to ensure efficient memory transaction
// Minimize data transfers between host and device where possible
