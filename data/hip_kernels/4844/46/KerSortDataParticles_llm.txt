```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if data reuse is possible.
// Align data accesses to improve memory coalescing.
// Minimize the use of divergent branches, like the conditional operator, for better performance.
// Ensure that the arrays are properly aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
// If possible, load data into registers for faster access within the kernel.
