// Use shared memory to cache idp values for faster access.
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction throughput.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing conditional statements.
// Utilize warp-level primitives to reduce atomic operations.
