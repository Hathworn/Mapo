```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring 'listp', 'normals', and 'motionvel' are accessed in a contiguous memory pattern.
// Minimize the use of shared memory by directly copying 'normal' and 'velocity' to reduce register pressure.
// Leverage the compiler's ability to optimize repeated memory accesses as in 'normals' and 'motionvel'.
