// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses by storing frequently used data
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize the use of local memory by optimizing the kernel or utilizing registers for frequently accessed variables
// Investigate loop unrolling within the kernel to increase instruction level parallelism
// Optimize the thread block size and grid size to fully utilize the GPU's computational capacity
