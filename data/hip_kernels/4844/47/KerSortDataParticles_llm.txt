// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for a2, b2, and c2 arrays.
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within threads is required.
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts and improve throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches, ensure that condition is evaluated uniformly across threads.
