```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for vel0 and vel1 for improved memory access patterns.
// Ensure that the accessed memory is aligned, which could improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Prefetch the data from global memory to registers to reduce latency.
// Use shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data by multiple threads.
