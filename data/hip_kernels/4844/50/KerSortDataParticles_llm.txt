```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the sortpart array to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure a and a2 arrays are accessed in a coalesced manner to maximize memory throughput.
// Evaluate using shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if possible to help the compiler optimize memory access patterns.
