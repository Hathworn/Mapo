// Consider coalesced memory access to reduce transaction overheads.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate using shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory bandwidth by ensuring all threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations.
