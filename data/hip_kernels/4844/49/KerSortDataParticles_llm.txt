```
// Consider coalesced access to global memory when accessing `a` and `sortpart`.
// Ensure that `a2` is being written to in a coalesced manner.
// Use shared memory if there are patterns of reuse in `a` or `sortpart` to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize branch divergence in the condition `p < pini ? p : sortpart[p]`.
// Check if using texture or surface memory can optimize access to `a` or `a2` if their access patterns suit.
// Consider loop unrolling in scenarios where multiple operations would benefit and the loop boundary is known.
