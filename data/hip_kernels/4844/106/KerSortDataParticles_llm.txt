```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store particle data within each block to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when reading from and writing to global memory for better performance.
// Ensure that the 'sortpart' array is accessed sequentially to leverage cache lines effectively.
// Minimize the use of conditional statements within kernels to ensure consistent execution flow across threads.
