```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory coalescing.
// Consider double-buffering techniques to overlap computation and data transfer.
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal access patterns in GPU architecture.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointer parameters to enable better compiler optimizations.
