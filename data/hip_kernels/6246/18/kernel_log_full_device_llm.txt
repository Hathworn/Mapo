// Use loop unrolling to reduce overhead and increase parallel execution
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Employ register usage to minimize memory access latency
// Investigate the use of asynchronous memory prefetching for improved efficiency
