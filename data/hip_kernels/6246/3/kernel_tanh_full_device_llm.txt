```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential thread IDs access sequential memory locations
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure memory data alignment for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branch instructions within the kernel
```
