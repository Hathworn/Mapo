```
// Use shared memory to cache repeated accesses to global memory
// Consider prefetching data to registers to reduce latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Explore using faster intrinsic functions for powf if available
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by adjusting block and grid sizes
