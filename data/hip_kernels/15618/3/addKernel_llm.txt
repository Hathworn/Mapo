```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance
// Use constant memory for data that does not change during kernel execution
// Explore increasing the block size for better occupancy if resources permit
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
