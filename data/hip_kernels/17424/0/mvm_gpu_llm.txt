```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for A_cuda and X_cuda to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Pre-fetch data for A_cuda and X_cuda into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use double buffering if the computation pattern allows, for further overlapping computation and memory access.
// Ensure that the access to X_cuda[j] is within the same warp as much as possible to reduce memory divergence.
