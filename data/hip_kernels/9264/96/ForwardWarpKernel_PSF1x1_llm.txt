```
// Use shared memory for u and v to reduce global memory access
// Coalesced memory access for src to improve bandwidth
// Use a single memory access for destination (dst) where atomic add occurs
// Consider using texture memory for src if access pattern is 2D and frequent
// Pre-fetch values into registers to hide latency and reduce redundant loads
