```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring both spatial and temporal locality.
// Cache flow and image row offsets to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed elements to minimize global memory access.
// Align data structures for coalesced memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for precompute weight variables.
// Use __restrict__ pointers to minimize pointer aliasing and optimize memory access.
