// Use shared memory to store tile segments of normalization_factor to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for reading normalization_factor
// Use loop unrolling techniques for potential performance gains
// Minimize usage of division by multiplying with precomputed reciprocal instead
