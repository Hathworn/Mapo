```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for rInput2 to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to buffer repeated data fetches where possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure gradOutput accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Consider loop unrolling for the reduction loop to improve speed.
// Use __syncthreads() wisely â€“ ensure minimal divergence and overhead.
