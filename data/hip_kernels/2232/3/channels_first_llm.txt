```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory is utilized effectively if the data is reused multiple times
// Attempt to unroll loops for reduced instruction overhead
// Make sure to synchronize only when necessary to avoid idle threads
// Align memory access patterns to improve coalescing and reduce memory divergence
