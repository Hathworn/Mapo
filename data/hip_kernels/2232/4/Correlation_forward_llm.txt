```
// Consider using shared memory for rInput1 and rInput2 to reduce global memory access
// Unroll the innermost loop further for potentially better performance
// Ensure memory coalescing when accessing rInput1 and rInput2
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to improve performance
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Prefetch data into shared memory if reuse is high
// Optimize data access patterns to improve cache utilization
```
