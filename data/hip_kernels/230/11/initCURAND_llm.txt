```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible
// Consider coalesced access patterns for better memory throughput
// Minimize divergence by aligning thread execution paths
// Ensure vectorization by using appropriate data types
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure memory consistency if needed
```
