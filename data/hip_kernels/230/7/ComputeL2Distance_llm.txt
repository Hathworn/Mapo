// Consider coalescing memory accesses for corrData to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure alignment of corrData to leverage memory access efficiency.
// Explore using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within the kernel block.
// Evaluate loop unrolling or other transformations to enhance instruction parallelism.
