// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Calculate dx2 outside the loops to minimize redundant computations.
// Minimize redundant global memory loads by storing intermediate results in shared memory.
// Ensure thread synchronization using __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions.
// Precompute indices and conditions outside the inner loop to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
