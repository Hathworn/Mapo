```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate computed values to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Avoid bank conflicts by using padding in shared memory
// Consider using texture memory for regular access patterns to improve cache hits
// Minimize synchronization barriers to reduce overhead
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance in iterative calculations
