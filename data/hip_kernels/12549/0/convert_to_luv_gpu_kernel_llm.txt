```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory reads for repetitive calculations.
// Use loop unrolling if an operation is repeated across multiple elements.
// Avoid divergent branches within the warp to maintain efficiency.
// Overlap computation with memory accesses to hide latency.
