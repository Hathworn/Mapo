```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for temporary arrays
// Prefetch global memory data to shared memory when possible
// Use texture memory for dev_in_img to exploit spatial locality
// Align memory accesses by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Consider coalescing memory accesses in loops where possible
// Minimize usage of __syncthreads() to avoid performance bottlenecks
