```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data chunks to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align data to improve memory coalescing and access pattern.
// Use texture memory for read-only data if applicable to improve cache hits.
// Ensure the size is a power of two for better compatibility with modular operations.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for the hardware.
// Consider using wider data types (e.g., float4) for data access to reduce the number of memory transactions.
