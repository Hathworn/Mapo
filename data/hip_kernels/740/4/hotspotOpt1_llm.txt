```
// Use shared memory to cache tmp1, tmp2, tmp3 variables to reduce global memory access
// Consider using texture memory for tIn for improved spatial locality
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for tIn and tOut arrays
// Experiment with different block sizes for better occupancy and memory throughput
// Prefetch data for tIn to hide memory latency while computing tOut
```
