```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize the shared memory effectively to balance latency and storage efficiency.
// Consider adjusting block and grid dimensions for optimal hardware utilization.
// Ensure atomic operations are used minimally to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Reduce redundant calculations by storing repeated values in local variables if possible.
// Use loop unrolling if beneficial to improve performance by reducing loop control overhead.
