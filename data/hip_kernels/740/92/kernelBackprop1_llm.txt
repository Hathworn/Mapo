```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing memory in a sequential pattern
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries for optimal performance
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for reduction
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to maintain warp efficiency
