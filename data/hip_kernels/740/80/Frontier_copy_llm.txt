```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures in memory
// Use larger thread blocks to increase occupancy and hide latency
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse among threads is possible
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce global memory transactions
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding if necessary
// Use streams and asynchronous copies for overlapping data transfer and computation
// Profile different block sizes to find the best configuration for the hardware
