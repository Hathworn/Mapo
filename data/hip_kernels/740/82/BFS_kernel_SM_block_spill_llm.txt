```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by using appropriate data structures.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Use warp-level primitives to increase efficiency in processing neighbors.
// Minimize branch divergence to maintain efficient execution across warps.
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques to reduce memory latency.
