```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance
// Ensure that both nabla_b and delta_nabla_b are allocated in contiguous memory
// Minimize divergent branches within the thread block to enhance throughput
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Assess the possibility of using float4 for accessing four floats at a time
// Explore loop unrolling techniques if processing multiple elements
