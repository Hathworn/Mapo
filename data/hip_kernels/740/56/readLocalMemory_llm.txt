// Ensure coalesced access to global memory when loading into shared memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and latency
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory
// Utilize loop unrolling to improve performance and pipeline efficiency
// Optimize shared memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
