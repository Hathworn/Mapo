```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data in memory
// Consider adjusting the stride to match the warp size for better coalescing
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when possible
// Prefetch data to local variables to minimize memory latency
// Ensure grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy
