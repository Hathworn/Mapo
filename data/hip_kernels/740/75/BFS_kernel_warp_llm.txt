```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for the edgeArray and edgeArrayAux to minimize memory latency.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data when possible to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Prefetch data to local variables when traversing edges to hide memory latency.
// Optimize warp execution by ensuring balanced load distribution across warps.
