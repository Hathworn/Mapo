```cpp
// Ensure global memory access is coalesced by considering alignment with warp size
// Consider using shared memory to store x[ix - j + k] and x[k * n + j] for reuse
// Optimize common subexpression calculation to reduce redundant accesses
// Use thread divergence minimization techniques to reduce warp execution time
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling for the comparison and update section
