```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate the benefit of using a memory prefetching strategy to improve cache utilization.
// Investigate potential bank conflicts and use padding if necessary to mitigate them.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergence and improve parallel execution efficiency.
