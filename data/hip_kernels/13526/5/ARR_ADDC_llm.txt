```
// Use __restrict__ to help the compiler with memory access optimizations
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for optimal GPU utilization
// Consider using shared memory if there is any opportunity to reuse data
// Avoid bank conflicts if shared memory is to be used
// Minimize the use of global memory by reusing register values if possible
// Ensure that N is a multiple of block size to avoid divergence
