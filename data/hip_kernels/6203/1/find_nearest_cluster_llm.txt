```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for clusters
// Ensure coalesced access pattern in loading clusters into shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling for calculating the Euclidean distance
// Preload multiple objects into shared memory if there is enough space
// Optimize thread-to-object mapping to balance workload
// Minimize global memory writes by using atomic operations when necessary
