```
// Consider using shared memory for input data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Implement coalesced memory access to optimize global memory throughput.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by proper data alignment.
// Unroll loops to minimize loop overhead for small loop counts.
