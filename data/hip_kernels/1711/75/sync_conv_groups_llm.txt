```
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Assess the use of constant memory for read-only data accessed by all threads
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and minimize memory access divergence
// Ensure alignment of memory allocations for efficient memory access
// Consider using texture memory for 2D spatial locality in global memory access
