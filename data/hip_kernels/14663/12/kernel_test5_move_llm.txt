```
// Ensure memory coalescing is utilized for optimal global memory access
// Check and adjust memory access pattern to reduce bank conflicts
// Consider increasing unroll factor for further performance gains if register pressure permits
// Prefetch data into shared memory if access pattern supports it
// Analyze memory access pattern for potential warp divergence and optimize accordingly
