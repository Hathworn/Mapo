```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalesced memory access patterns
// Investigate use of shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize use of expensive pointer arithmetic within the loop, calculate outside loop if possible
// Use warp shuffle operations to efficiently share data between threads if needed
// Ensure that the pattern and mask use bitwise operations efficiently to minimize computation time
