```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses within the loop for better memory access efficiency.
// Align memory accesses to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Check if using warp shuffle instructions can optimize data sharing across threads.
