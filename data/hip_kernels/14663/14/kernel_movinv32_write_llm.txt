```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data between threads within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations as they can serialize global memory access.
// Ensure the kernel launch configuration maximizes occupancy by setting block size to leverage GPU's hardware capabilities.
