```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for input_ and output_ pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Ensure input_ and output_ data are aligned in memory for better performance
// Consider loading input_[i] into a register to reduce redundant global memory reads
// Use shared memory to cache data if there's reuse within neighboring threads
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to the workload and block size
// Ensure kernel launch parameters (block and grid sizes) are optimized for target architecture
