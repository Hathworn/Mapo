```
// Consider maximizing coalesced memory access for x and y arrays
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned for better performance
// Reduce conditional checks outside critical paths to minimize divergent branching
// Explore using shared memory if accessing array indices repeatedly
// Evaluate if reducing the number of global memory accesses is feasible
// Profile memory throughput to identify potential bottlenecks
