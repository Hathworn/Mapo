// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory access efficiency.
// Perform thread synchronization before reduction to ensure memory consistency.
// Implement the power computation in shared memory to reduce repetitive calculations.
// Reduce divergence by ensuring all threads reach synchronization points efficiently.
// Optimize thread assignment to achieve better load balancing across the blocks.
