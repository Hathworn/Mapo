```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for vg_a to improve throughput.
// Use shared memory to cache data from vg_a for better memory access patterns.
// Ensure proper alignment for shared memory allocations to maximize bandwidth.
// Use register variables for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by strategically reading data.
// Consider unrolling loops for better compute resource utilization.
// Use half-warp reduction to improve parallelism in the reduction phase.
// Check for memory access patterns that can be aligned or optimized further.
