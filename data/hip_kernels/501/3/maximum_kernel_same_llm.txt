// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory elements
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Optimize the usage of __syncthreads() to minimize thread synchronization overhead
// Consider warp-level primitives to improve performance for reduction operations
