```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to hint compiler for memory access optimization
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning access patterns for x and bins arrays
// Minimize divergent branches in if-else logic to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data like knots to reduce global memory access
// Optimize loop bounds to avoid unnecessary calculations and reduce register pressure
// Consider loop unrolling in nested loops for better instruction throughput
