```
// Consider coalesced memory access for vg_a and vg_b to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory effectively by ensuring that it fits into available space and reduces global memory accesses.
// Ensure that memory access patterns are coalesced in the x and y dimensions to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize the stride loop to ensure warp efficiency and reduce thread divergence.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations in global memory writes to improve concurrency.
// Investigate the possible use of occupancy calculators to configure optimal block sizes given hardware limitations.
