```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for vg_a and vg_b.
// Ensure pitch_a and pitch_b are appropriate for coalesced access.
// Optimize shared memory usage to fit within its capacity.
// Use __restrict__ pointers if possible to help the compiler with optimization.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to hide global memory latency.
// Review the grid and block dimensions to fully utilize the GPU resources.
