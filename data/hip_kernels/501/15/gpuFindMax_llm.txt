```c
// Consider aligning the pointers to float data type for efficient memory access.
// Use __restrict__ keyword in pointer declaration for better compiler optimizations.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory accesses.
// Try using loop unrolling for the reduction loop for increased performance.
// Ensure proper allocation and usage of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
