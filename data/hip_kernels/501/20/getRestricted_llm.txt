```
// Use shared memory to cache portions of the data for better memory coalescing.
// Consider loop unrolling for nested loops to improve computation throughput.
// Apply vectorization to the dot product calculations to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Ensure memory access patterns are contiguous to optimize for the L2 cache.
// Prefetch data into registers to hide global memory latency.
