```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Optimize reduction process by ensuring no bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Align memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to optimize the loop iterations within NUMTHREADS block
// Check if using vectorized types can further optimize memory loads and stores
```
