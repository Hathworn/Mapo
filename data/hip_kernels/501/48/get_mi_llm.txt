// Optimize shared memory usage to minimize bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure proper synchronization is in place after loading data into shared memory
// Minimize warp divergence by structuring control statements for efficiency
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for global memory
