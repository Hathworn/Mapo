```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory reads for vectsA and vectsB.
// Use __shared__ memory for repeated data access patterns to reduce global memory traffic.
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring data alignment in __shared__ memory.
// Implement loop unrolling where applicable to reduce loop overhead.
// Minimize synchronization by optimizing reduction pattern in threadSumsA and threadSumsB.
