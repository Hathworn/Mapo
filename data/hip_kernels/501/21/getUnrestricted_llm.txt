```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Optimize access pattern to coalesce memory reads and writes
// Explore using warp-level primitives to improve performance
// Consider double buffering technique to hide memory latency
// Reorder computation to reduce warp divergence
// Use more aggressive loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
// Evaluate possibility of using texture memory for read-only data
// Review usage of constant memory for immutable values
