```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that threads access consecutive elements
// Prefetch vg_a and vg_b data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by effectively using warp-level primitives
// Ensure shared memory size does not exceed the available memory per block
// Consider using float4 for loading data to utilize vectorized operations
// Reuse registers effectively to keep the data in fast access storage
