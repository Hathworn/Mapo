// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data within blocks to reduce global memory accesses.
// Check if memory coalescing is optimal by ensuring that threads access contiguous sections of memory.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of loop unrolling if applicable for better performance in critical sections.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for improved performance on GPU architecture.
