```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if multiple threads work on the same columns
// Explore coalesced memory accesses for better performance by aligning dV and dNorms appropriately
// Investigate potential loop unrolling if there are repetitive operations on the vector elements
// Utilize warp-level primitives where possible to reduce the need for atomic operations
