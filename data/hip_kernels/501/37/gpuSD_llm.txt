```c
// Coalesce global memory accesses to vectsA and vectsB for better performance.
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls if possible to reduce warp divergence.
// Use float4 or float2 vectorized loads/stores to reduce global memory transactions.
// Consider loop unrolling for the computation of partial sums to improve performance.
// Ensure that accessed memory is aligned to improve load/store efficiency.
// Analyze occupancy and increase if possible by optimizing shared memory usage.
