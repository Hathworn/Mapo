// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory for intermediate calculations
// Use 'temp' array in shared memory to store partial results for reduction
// Ensure data alignment for 'vg_a' and 'vg_b' to reduce misaligned memory access
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow similar execution paths
// Optimize loop for 'offset' to minimize fence instructions and memory latency
// Strive for coalesced memory access patterns when reading 'vg_a' and storing results in 'd'
