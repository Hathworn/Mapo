```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure shared memory is aligned to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider using warp-level primitives for optimized reductions
// Coalesce global memory accesses by using aligned data structures
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring warp execution paths are similar
// Ensure that data fits into shared memory to avoid spills to global memory
