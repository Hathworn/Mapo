// Consider optimizing memory access by using shared memory to cache bin_scores
// Ensure coalesced access to improve global memory throughput
// Evaluate warp-level primitives for potential reduction optimizations
// Examine the possibility of loop fusion for improved data locality
// Profile kernel execution to identify memory-bound parts for further tuning
