```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'a' and 'b' arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory to store 'a' and 'b' data for each block to minimize global memory access.
// Use warp shuffle instructions for reduction instead of __syncthreads for better performance.
// Implement loop unrolling outside of shared memory to reduce instruction overhead.
// Evaluate using half precision or __float2 to increase arithmetic density within the kernel.
