```
// Consider using memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access contiguous memory locations in global memory.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts and ensure efficient data sharing within a block.
// Utilize optimized stride access patterns for improved memory bandwidth utilization during block-wide reduction.
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives for more efficient intra-block reduction, potentially reducing the need for explicit synchronization.
// Ensure coalesced writing of the results back to the global memory to utilize full memory bandwidth.
