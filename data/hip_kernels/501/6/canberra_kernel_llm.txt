```
// Use shared memory to cache vg_a and vg_b subarrays to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for vg_a and vg_b to improve performance.
// Optimize use of shared memory by ensuring all threads in the block contribute.
// Align data structures to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Utilize __syncthreads() cautiously to minimize performance impact.
