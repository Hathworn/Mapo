```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for vectsA and vectsB to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergence with careful management of if statements inside the loop.
// Use a single shared memory allocation to reduce shared memory usage and improve performance.
// Ensure shared memory is not oversubscribed by adjusting block size or memory used.
// Evaluate the benefits of loop unrolling in the primary for-loop.
// Explore the impact of different block sizes on performance to optimize occupancy.
