```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve memory read efficiency.
// Look into using warp shuffles for intra-warp reduction to enhance parallel reduction performance.
// Ensure that memory access patterns are optimized for the pitch parameter to avoid bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if further loop unrolling could be beneficial for remaining sections of the code.
// Investigate potential benefits of using the __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data access.
