// Consider loading vg_a elements into registers for faster access
// Utilize shared memory more effectively for vg_a access
// Optimize memory coalescing of global reads from vg_a
// Evaluate per-thread memory access patterns to reduce divergence
// Look into loop unrolling for the offset loop to enhance performance
