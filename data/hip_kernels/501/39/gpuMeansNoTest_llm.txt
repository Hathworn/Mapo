```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for vectsA and vectsB.
// Optimize for the shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts.
// Utilize __restrict__ pointer qualifiers for input parameters to improve compiler optimizations.
// Ensure all threads contribute to the final reduction using warp-level primitives (e.g., __shfl_down_sync).
// Optimize memory access by aligning data structures to cache line sizes.
