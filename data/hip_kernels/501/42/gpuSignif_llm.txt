```c
// Avoid divergent branches by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same instructions.
// Use shared memory to cache repeated values, reducing global memory access.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring data is aligned and accessed sequentially.
// Prefetch data to registers before the loop to reduce latency.
// Minimize the number of calculations inside the loop to increase throughput.
// Ensure correct memory access patterns to fully utilize memory bandwidth.
