```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory to improve performance
// Loop with strides to efficiently use each thread
// Use XOR operation to reduce computational complexity
// Ensure atomic operations by synchronized reductions
// Reduce shared memory conflicts by organizing memory access
// Minimize global memory writes by reducing in shared memory first
```
