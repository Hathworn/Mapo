```
// Consider using shared memory for mean and variance if repeatedly accessed
// Optimize global memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Investigate using loop unrolling techniques if applicable for index calculations
// Ensure memory alignment for float4 or float2 where possible for better throughput
// Leverage warp shuffle operations for improved performance on reduction operations
