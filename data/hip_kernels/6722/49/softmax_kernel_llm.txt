```cpp
// Consider aligning memory accesses for coalesced reads
// Replace atomicMax with a parallel reduction for performance
// Use shared memory to cache input values to reduce global memory access
// Use warp-based reduction to improve the speed of sum calculation
// Avoid branch divergence by restructuring loops
```
