```
// Use shared memory to store common data between threads to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory accesses when reading delta and prev_delta
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency
// Ensure memory access patterns are sequential and aligned
// Use constant memory for any commonly accessed static data like constants
// Optimize loop unrolling manually or via compiler directives to enhance performance
```
