```
// Optimize memory access by using coalesced memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access
// Ensure optimal block size to fully utilize device resources
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning data
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost computation loop
// Use warp-level primitives for faster reduction operations
