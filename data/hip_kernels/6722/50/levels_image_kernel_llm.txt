```
// Consider using shared memory for batch level data to minimize global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access for image and random data.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only image data to leverage caching benefits.
// Explore loop unrolling options for RGB values processing to improve performance.
// Use local memory for frequently accessed variables such as 'r', 'g', 'b' to reduce register pressure.
// Reduce conditional logic and use inline functions for improved thread utilization.
// Prefetch rand values to prevent latency in accessing float values during computation.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and reduce warp divergence.
