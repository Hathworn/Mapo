// Consider using shared memory to improve data reuse and minimize global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure optimal block size configuration to fully utilize GPU resources and achieve better performance.
// Minimize the calculation within loops to reduce instruction overhead.
