```
// Precompute reciprocal scale to avoid division inside the loop
// Use a register for var_accumulator to reduce memory access
// Avoid using powf by manually squaring diff for better performance
// Perform scale multiplication at the end to reduce computation inside the loop
// Ensure optimal memory coalescing when accessing x array
// Consider using shared memory if variance computation becomes a bottleneck
