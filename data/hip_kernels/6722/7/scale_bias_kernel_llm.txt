// Precompute batch size outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations
// Simplified index calculation reduces the number of arithmetic operations
// Use conditional checks to prevent out-of-bound errors and reduce unnecessary computations
// Consider loading 'biases[filter]' into a local variable to reduce global memory access
