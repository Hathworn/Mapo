// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing.
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory access.
// If applicable, use texture memory for read-only data to increase efficiency.
// Perform additional loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.
