```cpp
// Cache memory accesses for often-used variables to reduce global memory reads
// Use register variables for dc[i], s[i], a[i], and b[i] to improve performance
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for global memory to optimize memory bandwidth
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data if possible
// Minimize branching by restructuring conditional logic to enhance warp execution efficiency
