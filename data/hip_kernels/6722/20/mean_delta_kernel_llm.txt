```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve efficiency
// Synchronize threads to ensure correct computation before writing to global memory
// Use extern shared memory to dynamically allocate based on block size
// Optimize global memory access pattern by coalescing reads and writes where possible
```
