```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for 'output' and 'delta' arrays.
// Use shared memory to load data collaboratively within each block to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to maintain warp execution efficiency.
// Unroll inner loops to increase instruction-level parallelism and reduce loop overhead.
// Try using half precision if precision requirements allow, to increase performance and reduce memory bandwidth usage.
