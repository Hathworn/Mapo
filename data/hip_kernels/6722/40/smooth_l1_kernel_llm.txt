```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling for the main computation for increased instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure memory access patterns minimize bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Verify if using float2 or float4 can improve memory coalescing by accessing multiple float values at once.
