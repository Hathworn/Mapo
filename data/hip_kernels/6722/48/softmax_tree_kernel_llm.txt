```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to minimize global memory transaction overhead.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to reduce redundant global memory accesses during computation.
// Ensure atomic operations are not bottlenecks by optimizing the shared memory use.
// Optimize the launching configuration (block and thread count) for efficient parallel execution and to prevent resource underutilization.
// Evaluate shared memory size estimation to avoid over allocation and potential shared memory bank conflicts.
