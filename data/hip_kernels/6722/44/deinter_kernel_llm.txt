```
// Consider using shared memory for X and Y to reduce global memory transactions
// Reduce atomic operations by aggregating results in shared memory before updating global memory
// Evaluate if coalesced memory access patterns can be optimized further
// Ensure that input pointers (X, Y) are checked for nullptr safely before kernel launch
// Verify if asynchronous data copy can be applied to optimize data movement between host and device
