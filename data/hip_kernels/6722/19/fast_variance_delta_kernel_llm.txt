```
// Precompute index once to reduce redundant calculations.
// Accumulate partial sum results to reduce memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate sums for faster access.
// Perform block-wide reduction using shared memory to minimize global memory transactions.
// Avoid atomic operations by using shared memory for reduction within a block.
