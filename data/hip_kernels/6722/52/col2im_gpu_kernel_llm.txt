```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data reads and writes
// Minimize memory latency by reducing global memory accesses within loops
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce redundant global access
// Unroll inner loops if possible to improve loop execution efficiency
// Ensure each thread maps to consecutive memory locations to improve memory bandwidth
