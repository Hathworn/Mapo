```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize a single loop structure to minimize index calculation overhead.
// Implement parallel reduction to optimize the sum computation.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and avoid race conditions.
// Reduce the number of conditional statements in the reduction phase.
