// Consider using shared memory to store input data for better memory coalescing.
// Ensure that 'pred' and 'truth' arrays are aligned and coalesced for optimal global memory access.
// Optimize the block size and grid size based on the GPU architecture for maximum occupancy.
// Use float4 loads if possible to reduce memory transaction overhead.
