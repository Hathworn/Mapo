```
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access
// Align memory accesses to cache line size where possible
// Ensure INCX and INCY optimize for coalesced memory access
// Minimize stride in memory access for better cache utilization
// Utilize shared memory if applicable for repetitive data access
