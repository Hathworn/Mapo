// Consider using shared memory for data that is accessed multiple times to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory access coalescing by verifying that threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations; use reductions within blocks first if possible.
// Profile the memory bandwidth and latency to determine impact and optimize accordingly.
