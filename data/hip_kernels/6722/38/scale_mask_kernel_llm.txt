```
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning data structures
// Minimize branch divergence by reducing conditional statements
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop trip count is known and small
// Use shared memory if multiple threads within a block access the same data
// Assess warp occupancy to ensure maximum hardware utilization
