```
// Align memory accesses by ensuring data alignment for delta array
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Perform loop unrolling within the batch loop for performance gain
// Consider reducing the number of __syncthreads to minimize synchronization overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing its size to fit into shared memory limits
// Prefer warp-level primitives over __syncthreads for intra-warp operations
