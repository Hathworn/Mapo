```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better performance.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling in the inner loop to improve performance.
// Evaluate the memory access pattern of 'input' to reduce cache misses.
// Pre-compute values that can be reused in the loop to save calculations.
