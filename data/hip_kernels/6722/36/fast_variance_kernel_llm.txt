// Consider using loop unrolling to enhance performance in the inner loop.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for the array 'x' to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate the effectiveness of prefetching data into shared memory to reduce global memory latency.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by padding the shared memory array if necessary.
// Explore splitting the work into multiple warps to better utilize available SM resources.
