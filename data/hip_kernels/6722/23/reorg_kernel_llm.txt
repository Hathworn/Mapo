```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for reading and writing
// Consider using shared memory to improve data reuse and reduce global memory access
// Align data and access patterns to take advantage of memory coalescing
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
// Optimize the usage of registers by minimizing variable declarations within the kernel loop
