```
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable to improve performance
// Use shared memory to store commonly accessed variables to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses
// Consider use of texture memory for read-only data structures
// Check occupancy and adjust block and grid size for optimal utilization
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives for computations
// Ensure proper alignment of data to improve memory transaction efficiency
