```c
// Consider using shared memory to store tile of A and B matrices for each block to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning block and grid dimensions properly
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data to benefit from hardware caching
// Optimize the loop unrolling factor for the innermost loop for better instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure memory alignment of input matrices A, B, and C to improve memory access time
