```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for data used by multiple threads
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for gradOutput_data
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use __restrict__ to potentially increase compiler optimizations
// Assess thread block size for optimal occupancy and efficiency
```
