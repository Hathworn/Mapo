```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access to optimize global memory transactions
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() to reduce thread synchronization overhead
// Prefetch data into shared memory to improve memory access patterns
// Reduce arithmetic redundancy by minimizing recalculations
```
