```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache u, v, and src data to improve memory access patterns
// Optimize global memory access by coalescing reads from u, v, and src
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like src for better caching
// Minimize the number of atomic operations or use warp-level reduction if possible
// Evaluate the use of float4 for loading/storing multiple values at once
// Align data structures to 128 bits for potential memory bandwidth improvement
// Ensure optimal block size and grid size to maximize SM occupancy
