```
// Use shared memory to cache normalization_factor if it fits, reducing global memory accesses
// Consider using float4 or float2 for coalesced memory access if data alignment allows
// Load normalization_factor[pos] and use it multiple times instead of recalculating invScale condition
// Consider loop unrolling if the image size is within a known small range
