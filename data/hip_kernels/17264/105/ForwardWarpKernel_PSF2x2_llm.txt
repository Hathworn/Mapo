```cpp
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns with memory architecture
// Minimize the use of atomic operations or group them to reduce contention
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead
```
