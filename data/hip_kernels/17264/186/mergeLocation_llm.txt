```
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory when writing to x and y
// Minimize branching in the main kernel execution path
// Consider using a different approach to handle boundary conditions for ptidx < npoints
// Utilize registers effectively to hold intermediate results
