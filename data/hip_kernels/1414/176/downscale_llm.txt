```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Minimize register pressure by reusing variables where possible
// Use shared memory for common subexpression values if applicable
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy
// Consider the use of half precision for reducing memory bandwidth
// Combine arithmetic operations to reduce instruction count
// Consider loop unrolling for inner loops for performance
// Avoid branching within the loops for better warp execution
// Consider prefetching data where possible to hide memory latency
// Align data to cache line size for better memory access efficiency
