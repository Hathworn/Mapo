```
// Use shared memory to optimize data access and reduce global memory transactions
// Coalesce memory accesses where possible to improve bandwidth utilization
// Minimize thread divergence by avoiding conditional statements inside the main loop
// Consider using larger block sizes to increase parallelism and GPU occupancy
