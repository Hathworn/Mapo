```
// Ensure optimal memory access by reducing bank conflicts in shared memory
// Suggest using warp-level primitives for synchronization
// Explore using texture memory for enhanced memory access patterns
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring aligned memory access
// Consider splitting gridDim.x loop into nested loops for better cache utilization
// Evaluate using additional registers to minimize shared memory usage
