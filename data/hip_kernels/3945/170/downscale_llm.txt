```
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to reduce pointer aliasing.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory reads of gradOutput_data.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts through padding if necessary.
// Consider prefetching data to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize blockSize for better occupancy and use of computing resources.
// Ensure appropriate ratio of arithmetic to memory operations to hide latency.
// Use shared memory if applicable for data reuse to reduce global memory access.
