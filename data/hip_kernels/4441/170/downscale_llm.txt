// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for faster access within the block
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce the overhead of accumulation
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory reads
// Minimize conditional checks within the loop to improve branch prediction
// Investigate the use of texture memory or other HIP-specific memory enhancements
