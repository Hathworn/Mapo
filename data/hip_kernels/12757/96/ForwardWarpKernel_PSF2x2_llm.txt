```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for warp efficiency.
// Utilize vectorized memory access to improve global load/store bandwidth.
// Minimize atomic operations by restructuring computation where possible.
// Prefetch data outside the loop to reduce register pressure and improve latency.
