```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance by organizing threads to access sequential memory.
// Minimize divergent branches to improve the execution efficiency of the warps.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access if multiple threads access the same data.
// Consider using asynchronous copy if the data can be preloaded before computation.
// Avoid atomic operations if possible as they can become a serialization point in the kernel.
