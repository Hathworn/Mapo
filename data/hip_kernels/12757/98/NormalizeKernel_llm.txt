```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for normalization factors
// Ensure optimal block size (BLOCK_SIZE) for efficient utilization of shared memory
// Synchronize threads with __syncthreads to guarantee shared memory consistency
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve read/write efficiency
