```c
// Consider coalesced access to improve memory throughput by aligning access patterns.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access for frequently used values.
// Optimize loop's stride to avoid repetitive calculations with constant values.
// Ensure that memory access is aligned to minimize inefficient memory transactions.
// Consider using texture memory for better caching on read-only data like `src`.
