```
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing global memory accesses
// Avoid redundant calculations in the loop, especially index calculations
// Consider using shared memory to store values accessed multiple times in each loop iteration
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries to improve cache performance
// Unroll the loop to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
