```
// Move calculations of stride and idx outside the loop to reduce redundant computation.
// Use registers for frequently accessed variables to minimize memory access latency.
// Consider prefetching data from global memory to improve memory read efficiency.
// Evaluate potential use of shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Consider loop unrolling if the compiler does not already handle it for better performance.
// Explore warp-synchronous programming to further reduce memory overheads.
