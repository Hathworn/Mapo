```
// Consider coalescing accesses to dN_pTdpTdphidy_d to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure global memory accesses are aligned for better performance
// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate sums for reduction within a block
// Leverage atomic operations if sum update can be performed with atomicAdd to avoid conflicts
// Unroll the loop for reduction to minimize control overhead
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a block follow similar execution paths
