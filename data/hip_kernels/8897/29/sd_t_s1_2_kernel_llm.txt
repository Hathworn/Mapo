```cpp
// Consider aligning shared memory allocation with memory coalescing.
// Ensure that reading t2_d into shared memory is coalesced.
// Check if t2_shm can be indexed in a way that maximizes warp efficiency.
// Double-check boundary conditions for loop iteration on thread indices.
// Reduce shared memory usage where possible to allow for more concurrent blocks.
// Optimize index calculations to minimize division and modulus operations.
// Ensure that global memory writes of t3d are coalesced.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization.
