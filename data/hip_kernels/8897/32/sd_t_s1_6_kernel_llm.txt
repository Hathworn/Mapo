```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading t2_d into shared memory
// Consider reducing shared memory usage by packing data efficiently
// Optimize memory access patterns by reducing stride in loops
// Minimize use of global memory in the inner computation loops
// Reuse shared memory across iterations whenever possible
// Ensure memory access is aligned for better performance
// Consider loop unrolling to improve parallel efficiency
