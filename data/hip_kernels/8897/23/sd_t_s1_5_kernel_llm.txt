```
// Consider aligning data to improve coalesced memory access
// Ensure that shared memory size is optimized for the hardware's capabilities
// Optimize the loop unrolling for increased parallel execution
// Explore batched/strided access patterns to maximize locality
// Check memory access patterns for both shared memory and global memory
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() if not necessary to reduce synchronization overhead
