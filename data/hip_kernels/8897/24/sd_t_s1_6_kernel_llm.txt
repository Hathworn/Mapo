```c
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved access efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling for inner loops to enhance performance
// Apply memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Leverage use of __syncthreads to ensure all data is properly initialized in shared memory
