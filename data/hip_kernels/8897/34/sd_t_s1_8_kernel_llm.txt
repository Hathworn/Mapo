```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading t2_d into shared memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for t2_d
// Consider unrolling nested loops to improve instruction throughput
// Minimize use of atomic operations for memory updates if applicable
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid excessive synchronization
```
