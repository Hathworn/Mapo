```
// Optimize shared memory usage and reduce bank conflicts
// Improve memory access patterns to enhance coalesced accesses
// Unroll loops where possible to reduce branch overhead
// Use more efficient indexing to minimize compute operations
// Consider using more blocks and threads to fill up device occupancy
