```c
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider using loop unrolling for nested loops to improve performance.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Optimize data layout in memory to ensure coalesced access patterns.
// Ensure efficient use of registers by reducing the number of live variables within the inner loops.
// Consider using asynchronous data copy operations between global and shared memory, if applicable.
