```
// Use coalesced memory accesses when copying t2_d into shared memory
// Consider adjusting the shared memory size if T1 * 4 * Tcomm is large
// Use __shared__ memory efficiently to minimize global memory reads
// Ensure thread divergence is minimized within loops
// Optimize for occupancy by tuning block and grid dimensions
// Use registers as much as possible for frequently accessed variables
// Profile atomic operations to check for potential bottlenecks
// Consider warp-level primitives for inter-thread communication
