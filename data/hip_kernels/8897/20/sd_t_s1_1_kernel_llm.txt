```
// Use shared memory to load t2_d to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure appropriate synchronization with __syncthreads() to prevent data races
// Consider strided access patterns for t2_shm to optimize memory coalescing
// Minimize redundant calculations by identifying the specific indices within loops
// Perform boundary checks when using array indices to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
