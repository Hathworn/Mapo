// Consider coalescing global memory access for t2_d for better performance.
// Try to improve memory access pattern for v2_d to enhance data locality.
// Evaluate using more efficient index calculation to minimize computational overhead.
// Assess the benefit of persistent threads to further hide memory latency.
// Investigate reducing shared memory footprint to enhance parallelism.
