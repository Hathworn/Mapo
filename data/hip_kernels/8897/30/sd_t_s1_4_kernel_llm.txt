```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses in loading t2_d to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use __syncthreads() after loading shared memory to ensure all threads have completed data loading.
// Optimize the nested loops for better cache usage, potentially using loop unrolling techniques.
// Ensure the warp sizes are optimized and possibly aligned for reduced divergence.
// Analyze the index calculations to minimize arithmetic operations within the loop.
