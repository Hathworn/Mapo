// Load t2_d into shared memory efficiently using coalesced access
// Ensure synchronization after loading to shared memory to avoid race conditions
// Calculate all necessary indexes within the loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Avoid tied-up registers and shared memory bank conflicts
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses
