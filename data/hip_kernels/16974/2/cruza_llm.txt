```c
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses in 'newPop'.
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access for frequently used data.
// Reduce branching by streamlining the conditions for elite copying and mutation checks.
// Minimize divergence by aligning warp execution paths, especially in crossover and mutation operations.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to reduce potential issues with misaligned data.
