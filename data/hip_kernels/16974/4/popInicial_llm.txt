```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory fetches.
// Ensure data is aligned in a way that avoids bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Aim to increase occupancy by adjusting block size to better utilize available resources.
// Experiment with different grid and block configurations to determine optimal utilization.
// Reduce divergent branching within the loop when processing data conditionally.
