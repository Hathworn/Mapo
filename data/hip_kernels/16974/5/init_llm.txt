```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize divergent threads by organizing threads in a warp-friendly manner.
// Utilize asynchronous memory copies where possible to hide latency.
// Ensure memory access patterns comply with the hardware-specific requirements for efficiency.
// Assess block size and occupancy for optimal performance given the hardware architecture.
