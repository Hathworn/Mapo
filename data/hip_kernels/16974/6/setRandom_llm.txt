// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same path.
// Investigate coalesced memory access patterns to improve throughput.
// Optimize the usage of hiprand() to potentially precompute states and reduce runtime computation.
