```c
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning memory reads/writes
// Use shared memory to store intermediate computation results
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Decrease register pressure by reducing usage of local variables
// Consider increasing block size for better utilization of SM resources
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize global memory latency
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency
