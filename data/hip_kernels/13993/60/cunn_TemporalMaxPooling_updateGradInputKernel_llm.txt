```
// Consider coalesced global memory access patterns for gradInput_data, gradOutput_data, and indices_data to improve memory efficiency.
// Investigate possibilities for shared memory usage to minimize global memory latency during kernel execution.
// Evaluate the necessity of atomic operations and check if redesigning data access can avoid atomics while maintaining correctness.
// Examine potential benefits of adjusting block and grid dimensions for improved workload distribution and reduced warp divergence.
// Profile the kernel performance to identify any unoptimized memory transaction bottlenecks.
