```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Optimize memory alignment by ensuring input and output pointers are aligned
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within the loops
// Minimize divergent branches among threads in the warp
// Ensure that calculations in the loops are performed in registers when possible
