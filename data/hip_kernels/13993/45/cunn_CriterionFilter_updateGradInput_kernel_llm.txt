```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access within warps
// Evaluate if loop unrolling would benefit the performance in the inner loop
// Investigate whether using `__restrict__` keyword improves compiler optimization
// Leverage asynchronous memory operations to hide memory latency
