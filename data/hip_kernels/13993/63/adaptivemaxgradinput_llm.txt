```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns of threads
// Consider using shared memory if there's data reuse within warps
// Minimize divergent branching within the loop to improve warp efficiency
// Try to increase arithmetic intensity by optimizing calculations outside the loop
// Consider loop unrolling manually or using compiler directives for innermost loops
// Reduce the number of atomic operations if possible by reworking the algorithm
