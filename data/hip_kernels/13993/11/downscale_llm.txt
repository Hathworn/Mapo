```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning memory allocation
// Use shared memory to cache repeated data accesses within blocks
// Minimize the use of __device__ functions to avoid extra overhead
// Apply loop unrolling for the nested loops for better performance
// Consider using atomic operations if data races are detected
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration to maximize occupancy
