```
// Unroll the loop further to enhance performance.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring stride is coalesced for global memory.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data.
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency.
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized and only used when necessary.
