```
// Use shared memory to cache lifter_coeffs if they are read multiple times to reduce global reads
// Perform coalesced memory access when loading/storing feats for optimal global memory bandwidth usage
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further enhance parallelism and reduce divergence if applicable
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory when multiple threads access the same memory address
