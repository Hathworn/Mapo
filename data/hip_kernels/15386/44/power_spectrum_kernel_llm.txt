```
// Consider using const restrict pointers to improve memory access optimization.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing indexing latency within loops.
// Consider double buffering shared memory to overlap computation and memory fetch.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to decrease synchronization overhead.
