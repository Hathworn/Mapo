```
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access sequential memory locations.
// Minimize branching by reducing the number of conditional statements within the kernel.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Align memory accesses to warp boundaries for improved performance.
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure sufficient thread block size to maximize GPU occupancy.
