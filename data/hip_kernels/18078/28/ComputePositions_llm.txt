```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used variables.
// Optimize data loading by using coalesced accesses for g_Data1, g_Data2, and g_Data3.
// Prefetch data that will be used multiple times into registers to reduce access latency.
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated structure calculations to maximize execution efficiency.
// Minimize conditional checks by consolidating them, potentially reducing thread divergence.
// Investigate potential for warp shuffle operations to reduce redundant calculations across threads.
