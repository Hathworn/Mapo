```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access for improved performance
// Ensure warp synchronization to prevent race conditions
// Leverage loop unrolling where possible to increase throughput
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed constants
```
