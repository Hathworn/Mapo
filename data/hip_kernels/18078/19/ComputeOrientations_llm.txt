```
// Coalesce memory access to g_Data to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts
// Improve precomputation of exp values to reduce redundant computation
// Optimize boundary checks and memory accesses for better performance
// Reduce use of conditional branches within loops to enhance warp execution
// Enhance histogram accumulation using parallel reduction techniques
// Ensure no bank conflicts during histogram smoothing operations
// Avoid branch divergence in loops by ensuring consistent thread behavior
