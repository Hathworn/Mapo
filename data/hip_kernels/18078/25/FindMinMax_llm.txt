```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for better performance by ensuring sequential threads access sequential data locations
// Consider using warp shuffle operations in reduction to minimize shared memory bank conflicts and synchronization overhead
// Optimize memory footprint by reducing shared memory usage where possible, especially if the occupancy is low
