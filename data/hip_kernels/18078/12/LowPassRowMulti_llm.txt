// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for further optimization.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_Data when loading into shared memory.
// Add more loop unrolling if performance gains are observed.
// Ensure alignment of memory allocations for d_Result and d_Data.
