```c
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory accesses by threads in a warp.
// Minimize divergent branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead where possible.
// Align memory accesses to ensure optimal performance.
