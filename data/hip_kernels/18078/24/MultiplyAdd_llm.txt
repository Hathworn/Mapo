```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access
// Use constant memory for any other constant data to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for GPU occupancy
