```
// Ensure proper memory coalescing when accessing global memory in d_Data and d_Result
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by potentially padding the shared memory
// Use loop unrolling pragmas to maximize ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism) in the convolution
// Optimize shared memory loading with a double-buffering technique if possible
// Evaluate reducing register usage via compiler flags or manual adjustments
// Align accesses to global memory on warp boundaries to maximize memory throughput
// Check occupancy and adjust block size or register usage to avoid underutilization
// Preload commonly used values like kernel weights into registers to minimize shared/global memory accesses
// Avoid redundant __syncthreads() if threads are guaranteed not to overwrite each other's data
