```
// Utilize vectorized memory loads (e.g., float4) to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Align shared memory accesses to prevent bank conflicts.
// Reduce the number of shared memory synchronizations (__syncthreads) where possible by reordering computations.
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize the for-loop iterations.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce latency associated with global memory reads.
// Merge multiple conditional statements to reduce warp divergence.
// Optimize memory coalescing for global memory writes to d_Result.
// Evaluate the use of read-only data cache (e.g., __ldg) for d_Data1, d_Data2, and d_Data3 for better memory access patterns.
// Avoid unnecessary recomputations by storing intermediate results in registers.
