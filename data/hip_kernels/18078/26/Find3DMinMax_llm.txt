```
// Consider tuning shared memory usage to improve bank conflicts, e.g., padding arrays.
// Align memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access for d_Data1, d_Data2, d_Data3.
// Use appropriate loop unrolling to maximize throughput in the kernel.
// Ensure cache usage is optimized for the target architecture (e.g., AMD).
// Double-check memory read positions for any potential out-of-bound access to prevent undefined behavior.
// Leverage algebraic transformations if possible, to minimize floating-point operations.
