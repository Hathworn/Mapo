```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory access speed
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads in a warp execute similar paths
// Consider launching kernels with optimal block sizes to maximize SM occupancy
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to improve memory throughput
