// Consider coalesced access for d_Data1 and d_Data2 to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the given GPU architecture.
// Verify memory boundaries to avoid out-of-bounds access, which can cause performance issues.
// Check if further optimization can be done using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
