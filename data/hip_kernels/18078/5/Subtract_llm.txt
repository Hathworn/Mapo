```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring linear access patterns
// Ensure threads access contiguous memory locations for efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning memory accesses on boundaries
// Try using shared memory for often reused data within a block
// Minimize memory access latency by maximizing arithmetic intensity
// Consider using multiple warps to hide memory latency
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction level parallelism
// Experiment with varying block sizes to improve occupancy and efficiency
