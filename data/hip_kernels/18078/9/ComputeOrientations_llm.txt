```
// Use shared memory for data prefetch to reduce global memory access.
// Prefetch Gaussian values into shared memory to reuse across threads.
// Minimize shared memory size by optimizing histogram size.
// Use atomic operations efficiently to avoid thread conflicts.
// Ensure that memory access patterns are coalesced.
// Reduce global memory writes by caching results locally before writing.
