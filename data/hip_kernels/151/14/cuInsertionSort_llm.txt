```
// Use shared memory to cache distances and indices to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory for better performance.
// Unroll loops where possible to decrease loop overhead.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to enhance access speed.
// Ensure memory accesses are contiguous when moving elements to optimize throughput.
