```
// Use shared memory for data reuse and reducing global memory accesses.
// Utilize ternary operators to streamline conditional assignments.
// Enable loop unrolling for performance optimization by increasing instruction-level parallelism.
// Efficient memory access by checking conditions before accessing global memory.
