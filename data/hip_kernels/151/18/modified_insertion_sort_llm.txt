```c
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase cache efficiency.
// Ensure the kernel is optimized for warp execution to reduce branch divergence.
// Evaluate using __ldg() for read-only data to improve cache performance.
// Analyze the use of local memory to prevent excessive register spilling.
// Consider loop fusion techniques where applicable to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Verify kernel launch configuration for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Explore the use of texture memory for potential cache benefits in specific access patterns.
// If applicable, profile the kernel using tools like rocprof to identify additional bottlenecks.
