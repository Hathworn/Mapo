```
// Unroll the loop to increase memory throughput and reduce loop overhead.
// Use texture memory for coalesced memory access and to leverage cache benefits.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures appropriately.
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results to further reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure that the occupancy of the kernel is maximized by adjusting thread block and grid dimensions.
