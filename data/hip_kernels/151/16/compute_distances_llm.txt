```cpp
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure memory access patterns within the blocks are coalesced for both loading and storing data.
// Investigate potential bank conflicts in shared memory and adjust indexing to minimize them.
// Consider using shared memory more efficiently by ensuring all threads are involved.
// Optimize loop unrolling factor to achieve a balance between increased instruction throughput and register pressure.
// Utilize cuda occupancy calculator to determine optimal block size for better resource utilization.
// Consider using __ldg for read-only data for better caching on supported hardware.
