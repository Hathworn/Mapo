```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use conditional statements to avoid unnecessary memory accesses when indices are out of bounds.
// Employ loop unrolling in the innermost loop for improved instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is used appropriately to synchronize shared memory operations between threads.
