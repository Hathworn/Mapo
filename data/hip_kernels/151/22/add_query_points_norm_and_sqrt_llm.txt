```
// Use shared memory for 'sharedNorm' to minimize global memory access latency
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for 'array' to increase memory throughput
// Ensure all threads within a warp or block load data in a coalesced manner for efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to ensure data consistency between threads when needed
