```
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Ensure shared memory size aligns with block size for optimum utilization
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Optimize kernel launch configuration for maximum occupancy
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access for optimal performance
