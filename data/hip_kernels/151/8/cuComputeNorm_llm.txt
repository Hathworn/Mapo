```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve cache locality.
// Ensure threads within a block have synchronized access to shared memory.
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Optimize blockDim.y to fit the size of the shared memory and make full use of bandwidth.
// Load matrix elements into shared memory to reduce latency and improve throughput.
