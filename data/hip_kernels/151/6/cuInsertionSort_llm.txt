```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Pre-load the first k elements into shared memory for faster access.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring memory access within a warp is contiguous.
// Ensure bank conflicts are avoided when using shared memory.
// Reduce branching within the binary search section by utilizing warp-synchronous programming if possible.
// Use registers to store variables like max_dist for each thread to reduce repeated global memory access.
