```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Check for coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput.
// Use loop unrolling to optimize and reduce loop overhead in the computation.
// Ensure alignment of data structures for more efficient memory accesses.
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching if applicable.
