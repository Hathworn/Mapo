// Use shared memory to reduce the usage of atomic operations
// Accumulate values in shared memory to minimize atomic contention
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used to synchronize between threads
// Use atomicAdd only at the final step to accumulate into global memory
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing
