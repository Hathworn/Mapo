```
// Use float4 vectorization if possible for faster memory access
// Consider aligning input pointer to 16 bytes to maximize throughput
// Evaluate whether shared memory can be utilized for partial sum accumulation
// Ensure proper coalesced memory accesses to leverage global memory bandwidth fully
// Investigate bank conflicts in shared memory and adjust indices to avoid them
