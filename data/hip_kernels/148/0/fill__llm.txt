// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if there are multiple accesses to the same data
// Use vectorized memory access for better efficiency
// Unroll the loop to reduce overhead and increase throughput
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better performance on target hardware
