```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for values array
// Ensure colPointers array is accessed efficiently to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize shared memory usage by avoiding unnecessary __syncthreads() when possible
// Avoid global memory access by using registers for frequently accessed variables
// Leverage warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize synchronization
```
