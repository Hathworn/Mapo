```
// Optimize memory access by improving coalesced access patterns.
// Share more data into shared memory only if it reduces global memory access significantly.
// Consider a warp-level scan for accessing row boundaries to decrease synchronization overhead.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not limit occupancy; check and tune block size accordingly.
// Balance the use of __syncthreads() to ensure it aids synchronization without hurting performance.
// Evaluate the utilization of registers, shared, and global memory in the context of different GPU architectures.
