```
// Use shared memory for better memory access patterns in the computation
// Ensure coalesced access to the input and output arrays
// Check if using float2 or another vector type could improve throughput and memory access
// Explore prefetching if latency is noticeable
// Consider loop unrolling for the row iteration to reduce overhead
