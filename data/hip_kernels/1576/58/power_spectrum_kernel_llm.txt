// Use shared memory to cache data blocks and reduce global memory access frequency
// Adopt coalesced memory access patterns for A_in and A_out to enhance memory throughput
// Minimize use of __syncthreads(); consider alternative synchronization methods if possible
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to improve occupancy and execution efficiency
