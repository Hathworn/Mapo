```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance.
// Load lifter coefficients into shared memory to improve access times.
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded into shared memory before use.
// Use a loop to distribute work across threads efficiently.
// Assign thread 0 to handle special operations to avoid warp divergence.
