// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure block size accommodates all threads for full utilization of shared memory
// Optimize block size and grid size for better memory coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling if computation on shared memory is extensive
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads for shared memory consistency
