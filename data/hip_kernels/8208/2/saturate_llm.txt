```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for bins pointer to optimize memory access
// Ensure bins pointer is aligned to increase memory read/write efficiency
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed bins data within a block
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts by organizing shared memory reads and writes properly
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
