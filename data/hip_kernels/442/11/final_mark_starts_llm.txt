```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve read/write efficiency.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce branch divergence.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and improve parallel execution.
// Favor using 64-bit integer operations where possible for higher computational efficiency.
// Consider using asynchronous memory copies for overlapping computation and data transfer.
