// Load frequently used values into registers to minimize global memory access
// Use shared memory for comb_prefix to reduce memory latency and bank conflicts
// Minimize the divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same control path
// Align data access patterns with memory alignment for better coalescing
// Prefetch data into registers when possible to hide memory latency
// Ensure optimal block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy
