```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by structuring data to align with memory transaction sizes.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access when multiple threads access the same data.
// Reduce the size of datatype if possible to align with the smallest necessary bit-width.
// Load data into registers to reduce redundant reads in subsequent operations.
