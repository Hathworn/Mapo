```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data for concurrent threads
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if data is reused
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory for better performance
// Prefetch data into registers where possible to reduce memory access times
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce divergent threads
// Optimize thread block size based on GPU's specific architecture
