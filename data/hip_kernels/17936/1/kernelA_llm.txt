```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Evaluate if using texture memory can be beneficial for read-only data
// Minimize branching within the kernel for efficient execution
// Double-check alignment of memory accesses to optimize speed
