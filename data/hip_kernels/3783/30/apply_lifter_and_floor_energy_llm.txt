// Use shared memory for lifter coefficients to reduce global memory accesses
// Pre-load lifter coefficients in shared memory to minimize access times
// Synchronize threads after loading to ensure all threads have access
// Loop through columns with stride of blockDim.x for coalesced access
// Energy optimization applied only by threadId 0 for minimal synchronization
