```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to buffer reads and writes to optimize memory access
// Ensure coalesced access by properly aligning data for global memory access
// Minimize global memory usage by storing intermediate computations in registers
// Attempt to reduce bank conflicts by carefully managing memory access patterns
// Optimize loop unrolling to enhance throughput and reduce instruction overhead
