// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve cache efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have finished writing to shared memory before proceeding
// Use CU1DBLOCK to control loop increment and optimize parallel work distribution
// Atomic operations are used for thread safety in special case handling
