```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in contiguous blocks
// Use __constant__ memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize shared memory footprint by using conditional loading
// Unroll loops to improve performance and reduce branch divergence
// Ensure __syncthreads usage to synchronize between threads within a block
```
