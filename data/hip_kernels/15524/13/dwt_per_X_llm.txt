```cpp
// Optimize data loading by maximizing coalesced memory access patterns.
// Reduce conditional statements in index calculations for better performance.
// Consider using texture memory for repetitive data access to improve cache hits.
// Unroll loops with fewer iterations for better register and instruction utilization.
// Ensure shared memory usage is efficient to minimize bank conflicts.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers if applicable to aid compiler optimizations.
