```c
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring global memory accesses are sequential.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth and enhance data locality.
// Align shared memory reads to prevent bank conflicts.
// Utilize `__syncthreads()` wisely to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory.
// Employ loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve performance.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for writes into global memory.
