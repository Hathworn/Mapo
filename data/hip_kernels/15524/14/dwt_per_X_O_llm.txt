```
// Consider optimizing global memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory more effectively to minimize global memory accesses.
// Increase data locality by optimizing the way data is loaded into shared memory.
// Ensure correct usage of __syncthreads() to avoid bank conflicts and ensure complete shared memory writes.
// Further loop unrolling can be applied to optimize memory access patterns and arithmetic operations.
