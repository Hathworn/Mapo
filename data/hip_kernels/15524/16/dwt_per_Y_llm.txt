```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Employ loop unrolling for better parallel execution and instruction level parallelism.
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize halo loading by avoiding unnecessary boundaries checks.
// Ensure memory alignment to maximize cache efficiency and reduce bank conflicts.
// Minimize memory transactions by increasing the number of threads per block.
// Incorporate synchronization to ensure all threads have finished computation before proceeding.
// Check for potential memory bank conflicts in shared memory accesses to improve performance.
