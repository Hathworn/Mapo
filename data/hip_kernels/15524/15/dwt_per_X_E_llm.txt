```
// Consider increasing the block size to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Apply loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Preload data into shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Reduce branch divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Use syncthreads judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Assess possible asynchronous data transfers to hide memory latency.
