```
// Load data into shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if data is not aliased to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Ensure that the kernel is launched with appropriate block sizes to fully utilize the GPU.
