```
// Use shared memory to allow for coalesced global memory access, reducing memory latency.
// Padding the shared memory array with an extra column to prevent shared memory bank conflicts.
// Load data from global memory to shared memory in a coalesced manner.
// Ensure synchronization using __syncthreads() to guarantee all threads have loaded their data before proceeding.
// Transpose indices for coalesced writes to global memory on output.
