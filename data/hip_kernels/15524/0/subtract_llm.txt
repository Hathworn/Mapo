// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring data is accessed in contiguous memory blocks
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and parallelism
// Consider using vectorized operations for improved computational throughput
// Minimize divergent branches for efficient warp execution
// Balance load among threads for preventing idle threads
