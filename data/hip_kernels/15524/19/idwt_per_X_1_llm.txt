```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Unroll loops to improve computational efficiency.
// Clamp indices to prevent accessing out-of-bounds memory locations.
// Ensure contiguous memory access patterns for better memory coalescing.
// Consider using 'volatile' keyword if necessary to avoid compiler optimizations that may alter memory access ordering.
