```
// Use memory coalescing to improve bandwidth usage by ensuring threads access global memory in a contiguous manner.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts for optimal performance.
// Utilize the L1/L2 cache by ensuring data access patterns are predictable and consistent.
// Reduce global memory accesses by maximizing shared memory utilization.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Evaluate the shared memory size to avoid overuse, which can limit occupancy.
