```
// Ensure shared memory data loading is coalesced to optimize memory access patterns.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during access.
// Utilize #pragma unroll to maximize loop unrolling and instruction level parallelism.
// Minimize divergent branches within threads by consolidating condition checks.
// Prefer using constant memory for frequent read-only kernels to leverage cache benefits.
// Optimize thread block size selection to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency.
// Align data loading with warp size for efficient memory transactions.
