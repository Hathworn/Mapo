```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid conditional statements within the loop for performance improvement
// Utilize data locality by fetching data in contiguous memory blocks
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance parallel execution
// Make use of __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block
// Reduce redundant computation by loading necessary elements in shared memory once
// Ensure that all accesses to shared memory are coalesced
