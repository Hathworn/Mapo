```
// Consider optimizing memory access with coalesced reads from global memory.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure all threads have completed writing to shared memory before proceeding with __syncthreads().
// Utilize #pragma unroll to optimize loop iteration for better parallelism.
// Ensure all accesses to shared memory avoid bank conflicts by aligning data access patterns.
// Unroll the filter radius loop for performance improvement to enhance computation efficiency.
// Load halo and main data together to reduce branch divergence.
