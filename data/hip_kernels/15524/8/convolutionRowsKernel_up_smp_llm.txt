// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// The kernel parameters and calculations are performed using constant memory for frequently accessed data
// Unroll loops to reduce pipeline stalls and improve performance
// Load data in chunks to improve memory coalescing and reduce thread divergence
// Minimize redundant memory accesses by using conditional logic and avoiding out-of-bound reads
// Ensure efficient use of shared memory by calculating offsets carefully to prevent bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before reading from shared memory
// Optimize data storage and retrieval to minimize global memory writes, focusing on necessary data
