```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access to optimize global memory reads and writes
// Ensure shared memory bank conflicts are minimized during data load and processing
// Consider double buffering or prefetching data to overlap computation and memory access
// Utilize vectorized data loading and storing when possible
```
