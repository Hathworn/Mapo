```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring bottom1 and topdiff are coalesced
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant access to bottom1 and topdiff within loops
// Unroll loops for improved performance in accessing topdiff
// Minimize divergent branching by rearranging condition checks
// Reduce arithmetic operations by caching repeated calculations
```
