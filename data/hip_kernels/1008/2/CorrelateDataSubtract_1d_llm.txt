```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads/writes where possible.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier on pointer arguments to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block for higher occupancy if resources allow.
// Investigate the use of warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of manual summation.
