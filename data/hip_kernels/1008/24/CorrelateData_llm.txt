```
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access.
// Unroll loops to improve data loading efficiency from global to shared memory.
// Coalesce memory access patterns to optimize memory transactions.
// Ensure all threads in a warp follow similar execution paths to reduce warp divergence.
// Perform summation using shared memory to minimize costly global memory access.
// Aggregate partial results efficiently using a single thread in each block.
