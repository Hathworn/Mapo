```c
// Consider using shared memory to improve memory access speed.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a pattern that aligns with warp memory accesses.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Use loop unrolling if the loop iteration count is small and known at compile time.
// Profile to verify if the number of blocks and threads achieves maximum GPU occupancy.
