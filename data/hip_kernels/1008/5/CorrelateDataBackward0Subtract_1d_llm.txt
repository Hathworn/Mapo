```
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory reads.
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed available limits per block.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure contiguous reads and writes.
// Reduce redundant calculations within the kernel loop where possible.
// Align memory access to the warp size to leverage coalesced access.
// Loop unrolling may yield performance improvements in certain scenarios.
// Ensure sufficient synchronization between threads when using shared memory.
