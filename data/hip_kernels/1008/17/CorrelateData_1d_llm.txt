```
// Use more optimal memory access patterns to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses within the shared memory load loop.
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency.
// Minimize shared memory usage by optimizing patch_data size if applicable.
// Evaluate using constant memory for kernel constants for faster access.
// Consider increasing warp occupancy for better utilization.
// Analyze cache utilization and optimize memory access patterns for L1 cache.
// Leverage asynchronous data loading with __builtin_assume_aligned where applicable.
// Optimize thread block size and grid dimensions for better execution efficiency.
