```cpp
// Optimize memory access by reordering loops to improve shared memory utilization.
// Use thread coarsening or loop unrolling if beneficial to improve performance.
// Ensure shared memory index calculations are efficient to avoid redundant computations.
// Use __syncthreads() cautiously to ensure memory coherence and avoid race conditions.
// Consider reducing bank conflicts in shared memory accesses for better performance.
// Prefer using register memory for frequently accessed variables like 'sum'.
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing use of shared and local memory.
// Ensure computation intensity is balanced to reduce idle time of SMs.
