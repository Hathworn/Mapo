// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to optimize read/write patterns
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring memory accesses are aligned
// Evaluate using shared memory for common subexpression or data reuse
// Implement loop unrolling to improve kernel performance
// Consider checking for warp divergence and minimizing branching
