```
// Consider using a vectorized load/store pattern to optimize memory coalescing.
// Explore using shared memory more efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Investigate loop unrolling techniques for `kernel_size` loops to reduce instruction overhead.
// Optimize the patch loading by using `pragma unroll` for fixed-size loops.
// Experiment with reducing shared memory usage by computing directly in registers when feasible.
// Assess utilizing warp-synchronous programming methods to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate reducing divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Consider leveraging asynchronous memory operations for overlapping computation and data transfer.
