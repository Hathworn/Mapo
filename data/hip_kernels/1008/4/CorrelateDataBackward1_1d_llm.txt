// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed bottom0 data to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loops when possible for better throughput
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing reused values in registers
// Minimize divergent branches within warp
// Consider memory access patterns to enhance coalesced memory access
