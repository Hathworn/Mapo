```
// Precompute values like "round_off_s1" to minimize recalculations and improve efficiency.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed variables within threads to reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring consistent execution paths for threads within the same warp.
// Optimize loop indices calculations to prevent unnecessary complexity and operations.
// Reuse computed variables to avoid redundant calculations within loops.
