// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for input and output arrays for better performance.
// Minimize redundant calculations by precomputing frequently used expressions.
// Analyze thread/block configurations for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Review memory access patterns to ensure alignment and bank conflict avoidance.
