```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for flow and src arrays.
// Evaluate thread occupancy and adjust block size for optimal performance given current GPU architecture.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to leverage caching mechanisms.
// Avoid branching by using conditional moves or select functions where applicable.
// Minimize atomic operations by accumulating results into a local register before updating global memory.
