```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently used data
// Consider using texture memory for read-only arrays like src for improved cache efficiency
// Apply loop unrolling techniques to maximize instruction throughput if applicable
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data in contiguous blocks for each warp
// Preload data into registers if reused multiple times within the kernel to minimize latency
// Optimize the use of atomic operations by reducing collisions through data arrangement
