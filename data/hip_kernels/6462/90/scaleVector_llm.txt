```
// Check memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse if bandwidth is a bottleneck
// Ensure the kernel launch configuration maximizes GPU occupancy
// Verify alignment of memory allocations
// Use asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation and data movement
