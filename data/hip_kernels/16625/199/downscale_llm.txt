```
// Consider using shared memory for gradOutput_data when there are data reuse patterns.
// Minimize global memory accesses by caching frequently reused values in registers.
// Align memory accesses to the warp size to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when reading from gradOutput_data.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory for better performance.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can improve performance by reducing loop overhead.
