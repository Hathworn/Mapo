// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce memory latency.
// Evaluate if `accuracy` can be transferred to the device once instead of in every kernel call.
// Ensure the kernel is launched with enough parallelism to fully utilize the GPU.
// Check if `__restrict__` keyword can be used to give the compiler more optimization info.
