```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data structures on cache line boundaries
// Use shared memory to store row_sum and col_sum to reduce global memory access latency
// Use loop unrolling techniques to improve performance and reduce overhead
// Ensure memory accesses are conflict-free to fully utilize memory bandwidth
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning memory access patterns
