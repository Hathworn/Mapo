```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if applicable
// Coalesce global memory accesses by sequential threads
// Consider optimizing thread block size for better occupancy
// Use __restrict__ to help the compiler with pointer aliasing
// Utilize memory access patterns to improve cache performance
