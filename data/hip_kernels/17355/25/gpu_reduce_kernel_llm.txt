```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning vector load.
// Minimize shared memory usage by limiting its initialization.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction further.
// Utilize __syncwarp() to reduce unnecessary synchronization.
// Explore increasing block size to improve occupancy.
// Consider using Cooperative Groups for finer control of syncthreads.
// Investigate memory access pattern to enhance L1/L2 cache usage.
