```cpp
// Use __device__ or shared memory if appropriate for memory access patterns
// Consider avoiding potential bank conflicts with shared memory
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and parallelism
// Validate the use of atomic operations if multiple threads contribute to a single variable
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns
```
