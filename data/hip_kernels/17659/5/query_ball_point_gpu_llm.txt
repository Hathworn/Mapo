```
// Consider loading data to shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Move variable definitions like x2, y2, z2 outside the loop to reduce redundant computations
// Consider using squared distance to avoid sqrt computation for performance gain
// Try loop unrolling for the innermost loop to improve performance
