```
// Optimize memory access patterns for points and out arrays by ensuring coalesced access.
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory transactions for idx.
// Check if memory alignment improvements are possible to enhance bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit the coalesced access for the innermost loop.
// Ensure that the calculations for batch offsets are handled efficiently to reduce overhead.
