```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to improve memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data.
// Reduce redundant calculations by caching results within registers.
// Analyze if loop unrolling could improve performance.
// Use warp-level primitives to better handle reductions and data transfers.
