```
// Use shared memory to cache xyz1 data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for xyz2 to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use loop unrolling for the innermost loop to improve performance.
// Try to avoid branch divergence by structuring conditional logic more efficiently.
// Avoid repetitive indexing calculations by computing them outside the loop if possible.
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal load/store operations.
