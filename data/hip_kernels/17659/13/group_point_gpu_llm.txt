```
// Precompute point and output addresses to reduce redundant calculations
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by organizing data access patterns
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning data structures
// Consider using shared memory if possible to improve memory access speed
// Optimize thread usage to increase occupancy
