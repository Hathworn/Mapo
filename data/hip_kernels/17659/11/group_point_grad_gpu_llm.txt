```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize loop ordering to enhance coalesced memory access
// Atomic operations can introduce serialization, consider reducing their usage for better performance
// Organize memory access pattern to favor more efficient caching
// Consider using warp-level operations to further optimize memory access patterns
