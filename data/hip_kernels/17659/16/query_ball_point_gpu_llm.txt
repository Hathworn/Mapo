```
// Consider using shared memory to store xyz1 and xyz2 to reduce global memory access
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Ensure that memory access is aligned to avoid unnecessary memory transactions
// Avoid recomputing shared values, like d; store intermediate results
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Explore reducing branch divergence by reorganizing conditional statements
// Profile GPU occupancy and adjust block size or grid size for better utilization
