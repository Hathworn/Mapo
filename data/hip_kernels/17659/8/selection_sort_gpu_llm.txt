```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure each thread accesses contiguous memory locations to improve memory coalescing.
// Reduce synchronizations where possible to minimize performance overhead.
// Optimize loop bounds to ensure all threads are effectively utilized.
