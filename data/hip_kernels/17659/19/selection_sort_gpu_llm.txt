```
// Pre-fetch data to shared memory for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by distributing load across threads
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by padding if necessary
// Perform all computations in shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure all threads have committed changes with __syncthreads()
