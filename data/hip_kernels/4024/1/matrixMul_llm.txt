```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store tiles of matrices for faster access
// Implement loop unrolling for the inner loop to potentially increase performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for the a and b matrices
// Consider using warp shuffling techniques to reduce memory transactions
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to ensure maximum occupancy
