```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring data is accessed in a contiguous manner
// Evaluate if smaller block sizes improve memory access patterns
// Check if optimizing seed generation can reduce overhead
// Minimize bank conflicts by strategically organizing memory access
