```c
// Consider accessing data in a coalesced manner for better memory throughput.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory if data reuse within the block is high.
// Analyze if loop unrolling can be applied for further performance gains.
// Check if the launch configuration (block and grid size) is optimal for target architecture.
