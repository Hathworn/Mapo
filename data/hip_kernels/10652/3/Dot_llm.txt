// Consider accessing global memory in coalesced manner to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory effectively to store partial results and reduce global memory access.
// Optimize loop unrolling factor based on empirical testing for best performance.
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a power of two to facilitate efficient reduction.
