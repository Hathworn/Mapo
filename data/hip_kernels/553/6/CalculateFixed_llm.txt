// Consider using shared memory to cache subT and subBG values to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access, improving memory bandwidth utilization.
// Precompute index calculations where possible to avoid redundant computation within the loop.
// Investigate loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
