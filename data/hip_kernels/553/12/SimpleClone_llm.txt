```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider using texture memory for better caching efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring proper alignment in shared memory
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by optimizing block size and grid dimensions
// Pre-fetch data into registers to hide memory latency
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Use float4 for memory operations to take advantage of vectorized instructions
