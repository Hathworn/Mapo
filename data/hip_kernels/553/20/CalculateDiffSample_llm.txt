```c
// Use shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring adjacent threads access adjacent memory addresses
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory access patterns are well-aligned
// Prefer warp-level operations for better efficiency
// Balance workloads to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency
```
