```
// Consider using texture memory for read-heavy arrays subBG and subT to improve cache hits.
// Explore the use of constant memory for smaller read-only arrays like dir and coef for faster access.
// Investigate coalescing memory access patterns for subT and subBG arrays to minimize memory load latency.
// Ensure each thread accesses contiguous memory locations for optimal memory throughput.
// Use warp-based algorithms to replace some shared memory operations to increase parallel efficiency.
// Analyze the use of loop unrolling for the directional loop to reduce the number of iterations and improve performance.
