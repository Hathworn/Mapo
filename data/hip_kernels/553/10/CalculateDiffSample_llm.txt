// Optimize memory access by coalescing memory reads and writes
// Minimize shared memory usage if possible to increase occupancy
// Ensure shared memory size does not exceed the limit
// Consider using float4 instead of float3 for better memory alignment
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access and adjust if necessary
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce control overhead
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve compiler optimization
