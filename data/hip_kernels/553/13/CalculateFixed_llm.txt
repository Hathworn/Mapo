```c
// Use float4 for vectorized memory access to reduce memory transactions
// Preload mask and target values into shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalescing global memory access for target and background arrays
// Use texture memory for read-only data like background and mask when possible 
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by choosing appropriate block size based on GPU capabilities
// Optimize register usage by minimizing temporary variables
