```c
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for thread block, especially for dir and coef arrays
// Consider using texture memory for reading input, mask, and fixed arrays to take advantage of caching
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider loop tiling or blocking techniques if the kernel uses large data sets to improve cache reuse
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads in warps follow similar execution paths
