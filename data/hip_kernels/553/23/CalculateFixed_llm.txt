// Consider coalesced memory access for improved performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Avoid recalculating indices by storing them in variables
// Use conditional operations to minimize divergence
// Optimize loop bounds checking for better warp execution
// Group operations to reduce barriers in instruction flow
