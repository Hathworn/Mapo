```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Reduce if-checks inside loops for better instruction throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance further
// Try to minimize divergent threads in conditional statements
