```
// Ensure threads access contiguous memory to enhance coalescing
// Reduce divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
// Prefer shared memory for frequent data access within a block
// Align data structures to avoid misaligned memory access
// Minimize global memory reads and writes by caching in registers
// Balance load across threads for improved performance
// Use const memory for frequently read data that does not change
// Consider increasing block size for higher compute utilization
