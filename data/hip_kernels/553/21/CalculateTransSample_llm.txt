```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if data reuse is possible
// Optimize the ratio unrolling based on typical runtime values for better performance
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for improved memory efficiency
