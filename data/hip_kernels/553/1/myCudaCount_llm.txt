```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns across threads
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access time
// Apply loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput
// Minimize use of __syncthreads for better performance
// Optimize the access pattern to shared memory to reduce bank conflicts
// Preload data into registers to reduce memory fetch latency
