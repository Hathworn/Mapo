```
// Consider optimizing memory access by using shared memory to cache target and mask data
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when accessing target and mask arrays
// Minimize the number of redundant memory reads by loading data into registers when possible
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by structuring conditionals to avoid branching
// Consider altering the loop structure to enhance parallel access for target and mask arrays
