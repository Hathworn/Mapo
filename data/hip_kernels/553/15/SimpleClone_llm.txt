```
// Use shared memory to cache input data chunks to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for small constant loops to improve performance
// Employ coalesced memory accesses to further optimize memory throughput
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data that is accessed frequently
// Use constant memory for values that do not change during kernel execution, like 'ox' and 'oy'
