```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring d_x, d_y, and d_z are aligned
// Optimize shared memory usage if reusable data can fit in the shared memory
// Use loop unrolling to decrease the overhead of loop control and increase throughput
// Examine data locality to ensure data reused by multiple threads is stored close together
// Analyze memory access patterns and use read-only memory caches if applicable
// Ensure optimal block and grid size to maximize GPU occupancy
