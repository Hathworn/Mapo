// Ensure that shared memory usage is optimized to reduce bank conflicts.
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads.
// Try to reduce the number of syncthreads calls for better synchronization efficiency.
// Perform memory pre-fetching to hide global memory latency.
