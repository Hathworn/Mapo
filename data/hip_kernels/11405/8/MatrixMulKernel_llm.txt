```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency and improve coalescing
// Consider tiling to maximize data reuse and reduce redundant calculations
// Adjust grid and block sizes for better occupancy based on your GPU's architecture
// Ensure block size is a multiple of warp size for optimal performance
