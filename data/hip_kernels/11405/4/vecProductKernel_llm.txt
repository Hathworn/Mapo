```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce overhead
// Use shared memory more effectively by checking memory bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance when appropriate
// Evaluate the block size for optimal occupancy vs. resource usage
