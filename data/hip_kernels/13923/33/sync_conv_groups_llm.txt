```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved performance.
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize divergent branches to ensure warp execution efficiency.
// Align data structures to 128-byte boundaries to maximize memory throughput.
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques to hide latency from global memory access.
