```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for data1 and data2 for improved performance
// Utilize shared memory effectively by loading data in chunks and minimizing bank conflicts
// Optimize calculations by reducing precision where possible for faster computation
// Minimize unnecessary synchronization barriers to reduce warp divergence and latency
