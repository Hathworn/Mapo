```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if kernel involves repeated data use.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel for performance gains.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized to maximize occupancy.
