// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads and writes.
// Minimize global memory transactions by grouping accesses.
// Prefer shared memory data when repeatedly accessed in the kernel.
// Optimize shared memory usage by limiting shared memory size according to actual needs.
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions to reduce shared memory usage.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization barriers.
