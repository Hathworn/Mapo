```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible.
// Minimize thread divergence by organizing tasks to execute similar paths.
// Optimize occupancy by ensuring sufficient blocks and warps are active.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce global memory latency.
// Balance computational load evenly across threads to avoid idle threads.
