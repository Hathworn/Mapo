```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory bandwidth.
// Optimize the kernel to minimize the number of global memory accesses by caching data in registers or shared memory.
// Align data structures to 128 or 256 bits for better memory transaction efficiency in global memory.
