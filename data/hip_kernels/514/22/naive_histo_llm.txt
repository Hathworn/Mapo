```
// Consider using shared memory to temporarily store bin counts
// Reduce global memory access by accumulating counts in shared memory
// Use coalesced memory access for reading input data
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads execute similar paths
// Explore using warp-level primitives for efficient distribution
