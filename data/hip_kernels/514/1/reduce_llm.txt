```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for d_in loading
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing synchronization points
// Apply loop unrolling inside shared_reduce for performance gain
// Consider banking to avoid shared memory bank conflicts 
// Consider using atomic operations for the final accumulator in shared memory
