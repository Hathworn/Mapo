```
// Ensure coalesced memory access in d_in array to improve memory throughput
// Minimize atomic operations in d_bins by using shared memory for local aggregation
// Consider aligning BIN_COUNT to a power of two for efficient modulo operations
// Utilize warp-level primitives to further reduce atomic contention in global memory
