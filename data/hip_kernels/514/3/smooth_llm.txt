```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Apply loop unrolling to enhance performance.
// Optimize thread block size to improve GPU occupancy.
// Align data accesses to improve coalesced memory access.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
