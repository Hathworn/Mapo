```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider adding loop unrolling for further performance gains
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring branches are consistent across threads
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Ensure proper synchronization at each reduction step to avoid race conditions
```
