```cpp
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by coalescing accesses to global memory
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations in the reduction loop
// Ensure minimal divergence by avoiding branching inside the loop where possible
```
