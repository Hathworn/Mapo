```
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure proper memory access patterns to prevent bank conflicts
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize intra-warp communication
// Minimize the number of divergent branches within a warp
// Align data structures to cache line boundaries to improve memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
