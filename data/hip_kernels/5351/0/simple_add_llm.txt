// Use shared memory to optimize memory access and reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure uncoalesced memory access patterns are minimized through shared memory usage.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory.
// Consider bank conflicts in shared memory and adjust access patterns if necessary.
