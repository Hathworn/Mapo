```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Unroll loop iterations if applicable to improve instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure proper alignment and padding to prevent bank conflicts.
// Double-check warp divergence and try minimizing conditional statements within the kernel.
// Profile the kernel to find any bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
