```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Align data accesses to optimize coalesced memory access pattern.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient computation.
// Ensure data arrays are aligned to 128 bytes to take advantage of memory coalescing.
// Take advantage of memory access patterns to maximize the use of L1 or L2 cache.
