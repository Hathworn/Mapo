```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for loading data elements
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency
// Employ loop unrolling for the reduction step to increase performance
// Optimizing register usage can lead to fewer memory accesses
// Ensure appropriate data alignment to improve memory access speeds
