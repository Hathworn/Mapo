// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for data_l and data_r
// Ensure shared memory usage minimizes bank conflicts
// Evaluate if loading additional data into shared memory is beneficial
// Double-check memory alignment for optimal performance
// Investigate if loop unrolling could further enhance performance
