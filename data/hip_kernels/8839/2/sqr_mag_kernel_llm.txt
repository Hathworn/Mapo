// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency where possible.
// Avoid unnecessary load by directly calculating results without storing intermediate values in global memory.
// Optimize thread ID calculation by using constant expressions and minimizing redundant operations.
// Explore using texture memory for data with more spatial locality to possibly speed up accesses.
