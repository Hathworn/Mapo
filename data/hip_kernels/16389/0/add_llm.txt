```
// Use shared memory if arrays a and b are accessed frequently to reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Check alignment of arrays a, b, and c for potential performance benefits.
// Use memory prefetching if the hardware supports it for future memory access.
