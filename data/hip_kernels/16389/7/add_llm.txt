```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns for each thread block.
// Optimize the thread and block dimensions for maximum occupancy and performance.
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable for better instruction throughput.
// Consider vectorized data types for operations on multiple data elements in a single instruction.
