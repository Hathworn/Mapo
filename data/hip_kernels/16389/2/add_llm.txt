// Ensure coalesced memory access to maximize bandwidth
// Use shared memory for repeated data access if necessary
// Consider using vectorized types for improved memory throughput
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns
// Experiment with block and grid sizes to find optimal configuration
// Minimize thread divergence within warps
