```
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to improve memory throughput
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring continuous thread access to contiguous memory locations
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory through proper memory alignment
// Consider using read-only memory for input arrays a and b if they are not modified
// Minimize use of global memory by maximizing data reuse
// Optimize grid and block size configuration to achieve maximum occupancy
