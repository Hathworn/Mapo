```
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory access
// Minimize memory divergence among threads by aligning data structures in memory
// Attempt to use vectorized loads/stores if applicable
// Check if loop unrolling can benefit performance in this specific case
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the given hardware
