// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning access
// Consider using shared memory to store black hole data temporarily
// Minimize register usage per thread for higher occupancy
// Use the loop unrolling technique if the number of black holes is constant
