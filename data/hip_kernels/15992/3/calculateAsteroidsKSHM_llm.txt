```
// Use shared memory to cache blackHole data for faster access
// Minimize global memory access by utilizing shared memory
// Optimize loop unrolling in the blackHole attraction calculation
// Consider employing warp shuffle techniques for better performance
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a contiguous manner
// Align memory accesses to maximize memory bandwidth
// Pre-compute invariants outside of loop to save on repetitive calculations
