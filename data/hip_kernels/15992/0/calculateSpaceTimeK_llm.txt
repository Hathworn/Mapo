```
// Reduce global memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data like 'blackHole' array
// Optimize index calculation by storing frequently used components like 'i * nCols' in a variable
// Coalesce memory accesses for 'SPBox' to improve global memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling to decrease the overhead of loop control
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider using functors for calculations to enhance inline expansion by the compiler
