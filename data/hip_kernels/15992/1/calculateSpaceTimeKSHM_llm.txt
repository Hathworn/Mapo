```cpp
// Load black hole data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use memcpy to load black hole data into shared memory at once for coalesced access
// Ensure all threads synchronize after loading shared memory to prevent race conditions
// Calculate global index correctly for accessing the SPBox
// Use SOFTENING to prevent division by zero errors
// Use rsqrtf for more efficient computation of inverse square root
// Perform calculations locally within each thread to minimize shared memory usage
