```
// Consider coalesced global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize shared memory usage if possible to increase occupancy
// Ensure memory accesses do not exceed 32 threads per warp to avoid bank conflicts
// Check the possibility of using vectorized loads/stores for data_dots and centroid_dots
// Adjust block and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy and performance
