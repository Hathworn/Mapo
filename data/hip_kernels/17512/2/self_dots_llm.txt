// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Perform reductions within shared memory to minimize synchronization overhead
// Ensure data is coalesced during global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use __syncthreads() after writing to shared memory to maintain synchronization across threads
