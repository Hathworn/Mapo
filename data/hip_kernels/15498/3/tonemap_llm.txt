```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used variables like d_x, d_y, and d_log_Y.
// Coalesce memory access patterns for d_x, d_y, d_log_Y, d_cdf_norm, d_r_new, d_g_new, and d_b_new.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory alignment in shared memory usage.
// Use registers for variables like x, y, log_Y, and bin_index to optimize performance.
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of warp size to maximize occupancy.
