```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for d_in to reduce global memory latency
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper memory alignment
// Leverage warp-level primitives to further reduce atomic contention in shared memory
// Consider unrolling loops for better ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning workloads evenly across threads
```
