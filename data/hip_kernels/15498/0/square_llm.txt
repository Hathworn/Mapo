```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data are needed
// Minimize divergent warps within the kernel
// Ensure enough threads are active to fully utilize GPU resources
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve performance
