```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce texture memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory read efficiency
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() if not necessary to avoid performance bottlenecks
// Explore the use of float4 to read/write values for better throughput on 32/64-bit architectures
