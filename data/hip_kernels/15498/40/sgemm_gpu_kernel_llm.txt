```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for sharedA and sharedB loads
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Synchronize threads efficiently to maximize data reuse within a tile
// Minimize idle time by overlapping computation and data loading
