```c
// Consider coalesced accesses to global memory for optimal performance.
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately to avoid race conditions in shared memory operations.
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() by reorganizing code logic if possible.
// Ensure that shared memory is declared efficiently to accommodate the required data.
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
// When possible, unroll loops for warp-wide reductions for better performance.
// Ensure correct alignment of shared memory for coalesced access.
