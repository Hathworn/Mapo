// Consider coalescing global memory access for d_in array
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() for better performance
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently used to avoid bank conflicts
// Use warp shuffle instructions to further optimize the reduction
// Align data to improve memory access patterns and reduce latency
