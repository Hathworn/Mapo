```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring aligned data access patterns
// Minimize bank conflicts by structuring shared memory access appropriately
// Evaluate local memory usage to reduce pressure on global memory
// Explore shared memory utilization for intermediate storage
// Leverage occupancy for maximizing parallelization
// Assess potential benefits of loop unrolling for performance improvements
// Ensure minimal divergence to keep all threads in a warp on the same path
