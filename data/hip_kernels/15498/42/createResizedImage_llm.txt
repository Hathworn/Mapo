```
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads within the same warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Consider adjusting block size and grid size to better match the GPU's architecture and ensure full occupancy.
// Minimize divergence in warp execution by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Opt for using `__ldg` to read from global memory (if using newer hardware and read-only data) to utilize cache efficiency.
// Assess the impact of scale_factor on memory reads and try to precompute values where possible to minimize per-thread calculations.
