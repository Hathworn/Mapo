```
// Use shared memory to cache data and minimize global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by having each thread access contiguous data
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Consider using vectorized loads for better memory throughput
