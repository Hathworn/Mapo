```
// To further optimize memory access, consider using shared memory if applicable.
// Coalesced memory accesses can improve performance; ensure memory accesses are contiguous.
// Avoid branching within the kernel function when possible to improve execution efficiency.
// Utilize warp-level synchronization to minimize memory access overhead.
