```
// Consider using shared memory for data that can be reused within thread blocks
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for improved global memory throughput
// Minimize memory access latency by preferring read-only cache or constant memory
// Align data structures to benefit from memory coalescing and avoid bank conflicts
// Evaluate warp-level primitives to reduce divergence and improve synchronization
