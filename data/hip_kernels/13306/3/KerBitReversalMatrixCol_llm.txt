```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for block-wide data reuse to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches within warps to enhance execution efficiency.
// Align data structures in memory to improve memory transaction efficiency.
