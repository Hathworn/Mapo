// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if applicable
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to improve performance
// Consider using memory access patterns that maximize use of L2 cache
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory (if using shared memory)
