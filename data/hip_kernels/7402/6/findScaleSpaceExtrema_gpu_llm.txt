```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed values like currptr, prevptr and nextptr, reducing redundant loads from global memory.
// Use texture memory for reading data if the access pattern has spatial locality and can benefit from hardware caching.
// Ensure coalesced accesses when reading from pd and pgpyr arrays to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Minimize use of printf to reduce performance impact from atomic operations and synchronization points.
