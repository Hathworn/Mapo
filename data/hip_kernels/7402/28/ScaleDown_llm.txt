// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing redundancy and enhancing parallelism
// Unroll and simplify the y-Read/Write calculations for more efficient boundary handling
// Simplify x-Read boundary calculations
// Vectorize the main loop to enhance memory coalescing
// Reuse previously calculated brow values to minimize recomputation
