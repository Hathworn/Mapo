```cpp
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by aligning data structures
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access nearby memory locations
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for repeated read access to d_Octave0 and d_Octave1
// Minimize memory transactions by increasing the block size if possible and hardware allows
```
