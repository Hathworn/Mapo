// Switch to using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize global memory access by utilizing registers for frequently accessed data.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the hashes array.
// Use vectorized load/store operations to optimize hash value extraction.
// Evaluate using atomic operations for comb_prefix updates to prevent race conditions.
// Implement additional loop unrolling to further reduce control overhead.
