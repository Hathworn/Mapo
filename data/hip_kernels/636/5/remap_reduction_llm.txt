```
// Combine conditional checks to reduce branching overhead
// Utilize direct array indexing to improve memory access patterns
// Minimize conditional branches by swapping using conditional operators
// Consider memory coalescing by reordering data if possible to enhance throughput
// Evaluate shared memory usage to potentially further optimize read/write access
