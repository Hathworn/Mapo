```c
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like sort_indices to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using memory coalescing for accessing hashes to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use loop unrolling techniques if applicable to reduce the number of iterations and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Profile the application to check if further optimizations are possible in terms of reducing register pressure.
// If hash_count is large, consider using dynamic parallelism or increasing occupancy by adjusting block size.
