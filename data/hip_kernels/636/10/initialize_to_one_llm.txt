// Consider using shared memory if the data is frequently accessed by threads within a block
// Ensure coalesced memory access by avoiding stride larger than warp size
// Evaluate if memory alignment can be improved for better memory transaction efficiency
// Consider profiling with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance
