```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for d_in and d_out to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Align d_in and d_out pointers to prevent misaligned memory access penalties.
// Use shared memory if there are frequent data reuses within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure optimal thread block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring contiguous threads process contiguous data.
// Check if using vectorized loads/stores enhances throughput for your data patterns.
