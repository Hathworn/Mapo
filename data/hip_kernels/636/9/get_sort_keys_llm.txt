// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding data appropriately
// Employ coalesced memory access patterns to boost throughput
// Consider using texture or constant memory for read-only data access where applicable
// Minimize divergence within warp by aligning conditional operations
