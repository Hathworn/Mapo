```
// Consider using shared memory to store PairWise values to reduce global memory access.
// Enable coalesced memory access by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions when using shared memory.
// Optimize memory usage by minimizing the number of accesses to global memory per thread.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to improve instruction-level parallelism.
