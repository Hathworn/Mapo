```
// Use shared memory to cache force values for faster access as force[index] is read multiple times
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for positions, force, and vel arrays
// Try to align data allocations to improve memory access efficiency
// Minimize the usage of `fabs` and `ceil` by precomputing or restructuring arithmetic expressions
// Explore loop unrolling if applicable for further performance benefits
