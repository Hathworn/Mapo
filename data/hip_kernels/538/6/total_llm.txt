// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Leverage binary reduction tree for efficient parallel reduction
// Consider combining two loads into one if the architecture supports coalesced memory accesses
// Ensure correct boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds errors
// Balance between block size and number of threads for optimal performance
