```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory reads.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by appropriate padding if necessary.
// Use loop unrolling techniques to optimize memory access and compute-bound sections.
// Ensure three-dimensional thread blocks do not exceed maximum memory allocation.
// Reduce register usage by optimizing expression calculations.
