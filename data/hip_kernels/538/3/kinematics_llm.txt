// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced global memory reads and writes.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts for better performance.
// Use vectorized memory operations where possible to improve throughput.
// Implement loop unrolling for compute-intensive sections to minimize loop overhead.
// Pre-calculate values that are reused to reduce redundant computation and register usage.
// Consider utilizing local memory for frequently accessed variables to improve latency.
