```c
// Consider aligning data to enable coalesced memory accesses.
// Use __restrict__ keyword to indicate no aliasing and enable additional optimizations.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing storage space for unnecessary data.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for maximum occupancy.
// Evaluate loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead.
