```cpp
// Consider using float4 to load/store data for better memory coalescing
// Ensure that input array is properly aligned for coalesced access
// Check if BLOCK_SIZE is optimized for the architecture's warp size
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for input and output parameters to assist compiler optimization
// Prefetch data into shared memory if access is predictable and repetitive
