```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Implement coalesced memory access for 'force' and 'vel' arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate if using vectorized instructions for 'vel[index]' can lead to better performance.
// Analyze data dependency and memory bank conflicts to further enhance memory access patterns.
