```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for global memory
// Ensure shared memory usage is efficient and does not exceed the limit per block
// Evaluate if memory access can be further optimized by reducing bank conflicts
// Check if using __syncthreads() is absolutely necessary for this operation
// Explore the possibility of loop unrolling if applicable
```
