```
// Optimize global memory access by using shared memory for frequently used data
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input arrays a and b
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for increased performance
// Avoid divergent branches by ensuring index computations are uniform
// Use __restrict__ pointers if there's no aliasing to improve load/store efficiency
