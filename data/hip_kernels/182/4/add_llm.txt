```
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure memory coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Using a conditional statement for just one thread (idx == 0) is inefficient; consider using atomic operations.
