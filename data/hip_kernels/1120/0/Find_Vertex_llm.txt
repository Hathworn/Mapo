```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing
// Ensure edges and weights are accessed in a coalesced manner
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data in registers
// Consider loop unrolling for the vertex loop
// Check for opportunities to reduce warp divergence
