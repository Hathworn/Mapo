```
// Ensure data alignment for coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Consider loop unrolling for further optimization
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same path
// Balance the number of threads and blocks for optimal occupancy
