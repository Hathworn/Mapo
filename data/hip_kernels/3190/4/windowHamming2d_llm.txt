```
// Consider using shared memory for window function values to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance
// Minimize divergence in control flow for better thread utilization
// Optimize thread block size for GPU architecture to achieve maximum occupancy
// Pre-calculate constants outside the kernel if possible to reduce register usage
