```
// Use constant memory for frequently reused constants like c_PI_F
// Precompute terms outside of loops or redundant calculations
// Use registers to store intermediate calculations to minimize global memory access
// Ensure thread indices do not exceed array bounds to avoid invalid memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
