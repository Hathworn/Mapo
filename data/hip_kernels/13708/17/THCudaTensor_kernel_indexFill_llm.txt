```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like stride or index for faster access
// Consider loop unrolling in the second 'for' loop for better performance
// Ensure coalesced access patterns when accessing 'tensor' within 'idx_size' loop
// Evaluate if texture memory benefits 'index' since it has less frequent writes and read-heavy access
// Inline simple or small functions for fewer function call overheads
// Assess warp divergence and attempt to minimize divergent branches
// Consider occupancy tuning by adjusting block sizes based on hardware and kernel behavior
