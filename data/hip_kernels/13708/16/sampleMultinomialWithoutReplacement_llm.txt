```
// Optimize memory reads by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory bandwidth
// Reduce global memory writes by bundling multiple writes together
// Consider warp-level synchronizations to minimize thread divergence
// Avoid unnecessary recomputations by storing intermediate results in registers
