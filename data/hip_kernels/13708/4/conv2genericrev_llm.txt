```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for input and kernel data
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to improve memory coalescing
// Increase the usage of registers to decrease access time to shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling in the convolution loop for performance enhancement
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for reading input and writing output in memory
