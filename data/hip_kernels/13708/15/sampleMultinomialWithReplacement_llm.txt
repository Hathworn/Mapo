```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput.
// Minimize divergence by aligning thread execution paths.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency.
// Align data structures to improve memory coalescing.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize communication within a warp.
