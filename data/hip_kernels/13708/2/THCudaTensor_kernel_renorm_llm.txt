```c
// Consider using more shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Unroll loops to improve computation efficiency if applicable.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance.
// Reduce the use of __syncthreads() by optimizing reduction strategy.
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to improve performance on newer architectures.
