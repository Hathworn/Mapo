```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to store res_stride and index arrays
// Consider utilizing vectorized loads and stores for res and src arrays to improve memory throughput
// Utilize coalesced memory access for src and res arrays to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Investigate use of atomic operations where necessary to prevent race conditions
// Evaluate warp-level primitives to maximize parallel compute efficiency and reduce divergence
// Review kernel launch configuration to ensure maximum occupancy and minimize warp execution latency
