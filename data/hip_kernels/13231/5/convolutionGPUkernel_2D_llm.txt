// Consider using shared memory to cache blocks of M for reduced global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes.
// Evaluate thread block size for optimal occupancy and memory throughput.
// Minimize register usage by reusing variables where possible.
// Utilize constant memory for the mask if it's read-only and small enough.
