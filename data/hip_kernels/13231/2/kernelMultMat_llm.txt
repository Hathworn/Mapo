```
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing memory accesses
// Utilize shared memory to store sub-matrices and reduce global memory access
// Use vectorized loads and stores if possible to increase memory bandwidth usage
// Experiment with different block size configurations to find the optimal balance between parallelism and resource usage
// Ensure that the number of threads per block maximizes GPU occupancy
