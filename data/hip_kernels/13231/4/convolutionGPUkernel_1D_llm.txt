// Consider using shared memory for h_mascara to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure h_n is coalesced to improve memory access patterns.
// Increase the thread block size to improve occupancy and kernel performance.
// Align data structures to maximize memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate if prefetching data can be beneficial for h_n and h_mascara.
