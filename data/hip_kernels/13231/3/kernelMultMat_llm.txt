// Use shared memory to cache portions of d_a and d_b to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize loop unrolling in the for loop for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Consider memory coalescing for d_a and d_b accesses to maximize bandwidth.
// Reduce conditional checks with more practical bounds optimization.
