```
// Use shared memory to store reduction results to optimize memory access
// Implement binary tree reduction method to minimize thread divergence
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using consecutive thread indices for accessing Y, dY, and dX
// Optimize memory access by taking advantage of shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Align reduction buffer usage to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
