```
// Use loop unrolling for better memory access patterns and efficiency
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Optimize reduction using warp-synchronous programming to avoid bank conflicts
// Minimize synchronization by using warp-level primitives where possible
