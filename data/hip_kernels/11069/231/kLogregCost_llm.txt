```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory efficiency
// Consider using shared memory for intermediary results to reduce global memory traffic
// Use vectorized loads and stores if applicable to optimize memory throughput
// Ensure all memory access patterns are aligned to enhance access speed
