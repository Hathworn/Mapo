// Ensure the kernel launches with minimal resources as it performs only one operation
// Consider using constant memory if N remains unchanged during multiple kernel executions
// Utilize shared memory if the kernel will become more complex in future iterations
// Analyze if diversifying the workload into multiple threads would provide performance benefits
