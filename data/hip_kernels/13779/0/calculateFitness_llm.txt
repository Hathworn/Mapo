```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed values like roomCapacities, groupIds, and groupSizes.
// Reuse data across warps and threads to minimize reads from global memory.
// Align data structures and access patterns to improve coalesced memory access.
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable for the reduction to improve performance.
// Minimize divergent execution paths by optimizing the conditional checks.
