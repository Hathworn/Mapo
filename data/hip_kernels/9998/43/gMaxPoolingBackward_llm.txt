// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within the loop
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations
// Leverage vectorized operations if possible for faster memory access
// Reduce divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
