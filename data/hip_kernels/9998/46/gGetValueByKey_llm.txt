```cpp
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by sequentially arranging threads
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Consider using fewer blocks with more threads per block to improve occupancy
// Align data to ensure optimal memory access patterns
// Use asynchronous memory copies to overlap data transfer and computation
```
