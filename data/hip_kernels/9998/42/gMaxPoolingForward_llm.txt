```
// Use shared memory for mask to optimize memory access patterns
// Preload input block into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Combine rowId and colId calculation to remove division operations
// Minimize pointer arithmetic by using pre-computed indices
// Consider loop unrolling for wider pools to reduce iteration overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access for both input and output arrays
