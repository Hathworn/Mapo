```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Investigate if using vectorized data types (e.g., float2) can improve memory coalescing.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size and grid size for better performance.
