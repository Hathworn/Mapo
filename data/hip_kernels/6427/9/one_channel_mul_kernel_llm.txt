```
// Use shared memory to store data_r for better memory access patterns
// Consider using coalesced memory access for data_l and result arrays
// Minimize the use of global memory by calculating one_ch_idx in a register
// Make use of __syncthreads() if data sharing between threads is required
// Optimize load/store operations to reduce the number of memory transactions
// Unroll loops if applicable to improve parallel execution
