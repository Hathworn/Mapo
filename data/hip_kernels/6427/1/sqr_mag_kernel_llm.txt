// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to advise the compiler of non-aliasing
// Use shared memory if possible to cache data from global memory for reduced read latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures to benefit from hardware capabilities
// Employ warp-wide reduction or atomic operations cautiously for parallel reduction strategies
