// Consider using shared memory to cache src data to reduce global memory access latency  
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning src and dest data  
// Optimize loop by unrolling to reduce instruction overhead  
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help compiler with more aggressive optimizations  
// Evaluate use of warp shuffle to aggregate results more efficiently
