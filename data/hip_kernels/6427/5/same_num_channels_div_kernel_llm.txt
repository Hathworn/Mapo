```
// Ensure data access is coalesced by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the floating-point operations by reducing precision if acceptable, or using fused operations to reduce errors.
// Analyze occupancy and try to achieve the maximum number of active warps per multiprocessor.
// Adjust the block size and grid size for better resource utilization and reduced warp divergence.
// Consider aligning data structures to ensure optimal memory access patterns.
// Profile the memory bandwidth and occupancy to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
