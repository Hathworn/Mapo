```
// Consider using shared memory to store data_l for reduced global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access for data_l and result to improve memory throughput
// Check if using vectorized memory operations can further improve performance
// Evaluate if adjusting block size or grid size could better utilize the GPU's resources
// Explore if loop unrolling could enhance kernel performance for the two-element processing
