```c
// Consider using coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
// Use shared memory efficiently to avoid bank conflicts
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Use appropriate synchronization to prevent race conditions
// Balance between computation and memory transactions
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance if the block size is known at compile time
// Store intermediate results that are reused in shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
