```
// Unroll loops to reduce loop overhead and improve thread performance
// Use max/min functions to prevent branches for better SIMT efficiency
// Employ bitwise operations for modulus calculation to replace expensive division
// Move computation of Gaussian values outside the main loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Prefetch data using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize histogram smoothing with fewer operations by combining multiple reads/writes
// Use conditional assignments to minimize divergent branches within threads
