```
// Use coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures to warp size
// Minimize divergent branches within warp for better performance
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access latency
// Balance thread work load to maximize occupancy and efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling for the 'k' loop to increase instruction level parallelism
// Use __restrict__ on pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Explore using shuffle instructions for inter-warp communication to decrease global memory dependence
// Profile and fine-tune yStride and xStride values for optimal loop performance
