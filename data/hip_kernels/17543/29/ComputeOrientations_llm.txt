```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced in g_Data reads
// Consider using texture memory for constant memory access patterns in gauss[] initialization
// Use loop unrolling techniques to enhance the performance of the inner loops
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses (data and hist arrays)
// Optimize reduction patterns to ensure minimal shared memory contention
// Evaluate using atomics or warp shuffling for histogram updates to improve performance
