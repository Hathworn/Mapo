```c
// Consider aligning data to improve memory coalescing.
// Use float4 or other vectorized types to load/store data efficiently if applicable.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by reorganizing data dependencies.
// Experiment with loop unrolling for potential performance gains.
// Ensure data is loaded into shared memory only when necessary.
// Consider using constant memory for read-only threshold values.
