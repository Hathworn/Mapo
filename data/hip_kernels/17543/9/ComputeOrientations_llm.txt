```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads from global memory.
// Employ further reduction techniques for the histogram to minimize the number of atomic operations.
// Investigate the possibility of using texture memory for better cache performance.
// Leverage warp-level primitives for more efficient reduction and histogram smoothing.
// Ensure that data loading into shared memory is done efficiently to maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Review the calculation of gradients to check if any redundant computations can be eliminated.
