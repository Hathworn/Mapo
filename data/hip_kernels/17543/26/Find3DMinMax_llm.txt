```
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Load data into shared memory in coalesced accesses to improve coalescing and reduce latency.
// Use __syncthreads with precise timing to ensure memory consistency and avoid race conditions.
// Consider memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts and optimize memory throughput.
// Reuse shared memory buffers strategically to reduce the amount of shared memory required.
