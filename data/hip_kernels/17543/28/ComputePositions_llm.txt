// Optimize memory access by ensuring g_Data1, g_Data2, and g_Data3 are allocated in coalesced global memory
// Minimize redundant memory reads by caching frequently accessed values like g_Data2[p], g_Data3[p], and g_Data1[p] in registers
// Use shared memory to store intermediate values such as cross derivatives for reduction in global memory access latency
// Apply padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory (if shared memory is used for intermediate computations)
// Ensure d_Ptrs accesses are coalesced and aligned to avoid uncoalesced global memory reads
// Replace division with __fdividef for better performance in GPUs
// Consider loop unrolling or warp-level parallelism for calculations of cross derivatives to improve throughput
// Check whether constant memory can be leveraged for d_ConstantA and d_ConstantB
