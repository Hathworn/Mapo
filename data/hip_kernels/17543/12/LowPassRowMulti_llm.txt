```cpp
// Use shared memory for data reuse and reduce global memory access
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory indexing doesn't conflict
// Load data using min-max without branching to ensure efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data from global memory
// Only process valid threads to reduce unnecessary computations
```
