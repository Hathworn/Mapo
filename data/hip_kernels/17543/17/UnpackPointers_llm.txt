```
// Use shared memory to cache portions of minmax array
// Maximize coalesced memory accesses by aligning threads' memory requests
// Consider pre-fetching values to registers and minimizing redundant calculations
// Ensure memory access patterns are suitable for hardware prefetching
// Consider using a tile-based algorithm to improve cache utilization
// Explore warp-level primitives like __shfl_sync for efficient data sharing
