```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for d_Data to improve performance.
// Use float2 or float4 types to load/store multiple values at once for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Explore the possibility of using asynchronous memory prefetching to hide memory latency.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for shared memory variables to maximize throughput.
// Optimize the reduction loop by unrolling for improved performance.
