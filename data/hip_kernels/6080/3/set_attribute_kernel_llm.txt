```c
// Consider aligning data access with memory coalescing
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory transactions
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Ensure __syncthreads() is placed correctly to avoid race conditions
// Optimize load/store operations to maximize memory throughput
