// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by coalescing memory reads and writes to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate if using a larger shared memory buffer size is beneficial for your specific use case and architecture.
// Assess if other types of memory optimizations, such as using __ldg() for read-only data, could yield performance improvements.
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() is necessary; reduce its usage where possible to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Optimize memory access by using tiling strategies to enhance caching efficiency if applicable.
