```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory throughput
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring uniform control flow for threads
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize atomic operations by using per-thread registers when possible
// Ensure that __syncthreads() usage is necessary to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Evaluate different block sizes for optimal occupancy and performance
