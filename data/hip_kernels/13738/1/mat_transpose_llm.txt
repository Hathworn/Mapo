```
// Use shared memory to improve access patterns and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced global memory reads by loading data in tiles
// Ensure that out-of-bounds checks are performed to avoid memory access violations
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed writing to shared memory before reading
// Transpose operation benefits from shared memory as it provides fast access to data
