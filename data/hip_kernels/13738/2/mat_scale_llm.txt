```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Ensure that 'a' and 'c' are allocated with proper alignment to improve memory access patterns.
// Explore using shared memory to temporarily store data within a block for faster access.
// Assess the use of vectorized operations to process multiple elements per thread for better throughput.
// Evaluate loop unrolling in the depth loop to minimize overhead and improve pipeline efficiency.
