```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory bandwidth utilization
// Preload data into shared memory if further computations are required to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory allocations are properly aligned to improve performance on newer architectures
// Use data prefetching techniques if applicable to hide memory latency
```
