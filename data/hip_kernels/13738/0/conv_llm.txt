// Optimize loops using shared memory (assuming it's properly sized)
// Consider optimizing access patterns for t and tk
// Load data into shared memory for faster access
// Ensure shared memory usage fits within hardware limits
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately for synchronization
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access
