```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data to ensure better memory throughput
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp take similar execution paths
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block
// Optimize block and grid size for maximum occupancy and memory access patterns
// Ensure memory access patterns utilize full memory bandwidth available
