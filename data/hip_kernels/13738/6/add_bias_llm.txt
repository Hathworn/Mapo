```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data properly
// Minimize indexing computations by using pointers
// Consider using shared memory if accessing the same data multiple times
// Loop unrolling is applied for performance; verify size_z is suitable for it
// Consider using texture or constant memory for bias if it is read-only
```
