```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory reads.
// Try coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that 'n' is a multiple of blockDim.x for optimal performance.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if the data does not alias.
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize performance for hardware.
