// Use shared memory to store ghatmap for faster access
// Minimize global memory accesses by using registers to store scaled_real and scaled_imag
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements in pwcc
// Consider using stream synchronization for better parallel execution when nmaps == 2
