// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure blockDim.x is set to 256 or less to match shared memory allocation.
// Load data from global memory to shared memory to reduce access latency.
// Synchronize threads with __syncthreads() for correct shared memory operations.
// Perform computation directly in shared memory.
// Store results back to global memory after computation to reduce overall access.
