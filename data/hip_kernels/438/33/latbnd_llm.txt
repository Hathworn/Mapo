```
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use __builtin_assumed_aligned to ensure data pointers are properly aligned for coalesced access.
// Verify the dimensions of the shared memory arrays to ensure they match the memory warp size for better performance.
// Evaluate using float4 or float2 data types for vectorized memory operations to enhance throughput.
// Ensure that memory transactions are minimized by loading and storing data in a coalesced manner.
// Investigate the possibility of loop unrolling for additional performance gains in the kernel.
// Analyze and optimize register usage to prevent register spilling and maximize occupancy.
// Exploit any available shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency wherever possible.
// Consider using __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize threads only when necessary to optimize performance.
// Re-evaluate boundary condition calculations to improve the efficiency of edge-case handling.
