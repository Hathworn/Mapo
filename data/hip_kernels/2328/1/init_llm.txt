```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Consider leveraging texture memory for better caching performance where applicable.
// Use loop unrolling where possible to enhance the throughput of the kernel.
// Ensure memory alignment to improve bandwidth utilization.
