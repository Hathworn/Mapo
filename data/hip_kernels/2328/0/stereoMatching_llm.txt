```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations in global memory.
// Use shared memory to store window data if window size is small enough to fit, reducing redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize texture memory usage by caching reused texture fetches in registers whenever possible.
// Minimize use of expensive operations like division within inner loops.
// Consider loop unrolling for the evaluateCost function to reduce loop overhead.
