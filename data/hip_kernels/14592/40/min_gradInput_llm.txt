```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for input and output arrays
// Ensure indices array is accessed optimally to reduce memory divergence
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate computations if applicable
// Minimize the use of global memory by using registers for frequently accessed data
// Assess the opportunity for loop unrolling to improve thread utilization
