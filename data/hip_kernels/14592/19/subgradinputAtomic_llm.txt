```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for gradInput and gradOutput 
// Cache the output offset calculation outside the yy and xx loops
// Use shared memory to store weights to optimize repeated loads
// Avoid use of atomic operations where possible, explore partial summation strategy
// Use loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism further
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for higher occupancy and better hardware utilization
