```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory bandwidth
// Load input and target data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure the usage of fast math operations if precision allows
// Consider using vectorized memory accesses for large data to enhance throughput
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
