// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to cache input blocks and reduce global memory traffic.
// Try minimizing bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could lead to performance improvements.
// Ensure the data is aligned properly for global memory accesses.
