```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when loading gradOutput, indices_x, and indices_y
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for recurrent data
// Utilize loop unrolling for better performance when accessing neighboring elements
// Ensure alignment of data structures for memory access to improve bandwidth efficiency
