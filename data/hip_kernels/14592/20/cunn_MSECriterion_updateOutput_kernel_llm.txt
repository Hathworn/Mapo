// Consider using shared memory to store input_k and target_k values to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize buffer usage to ensure memory coalescing and improve thread access patterns
// Implement double buffering techniques for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate if using warp-level primitives can further improve reduction efficiency
// Consider unrolling loops for better performance on certain architectures
