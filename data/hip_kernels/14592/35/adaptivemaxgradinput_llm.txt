```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent threads to optimize warp execution
// Precompute indices offset outside the loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Align data access patterns with memory architecture for efficient caching
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to decrease global memory access
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
