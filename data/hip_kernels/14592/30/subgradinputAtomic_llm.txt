```
// Optimize memory access by utilizing shared memory if possible
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Assess the possibility of loop unrolling further for improved parallel execution
// Evaluate the usage of atomic operations for parallel reduction and explore alternatives
// Implement thread synchronization where necessary to prevent race conditions
