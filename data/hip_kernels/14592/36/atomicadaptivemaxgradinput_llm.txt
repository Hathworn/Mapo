```c
// Consider coalescing global memory access for gradOutput, gradInput, indices_x, and indices_y.
// Ensure proper alignment to maximize memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory fetches.
// Explore loop unrolling to reduce the loop control overhead.
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring similar execution paths for threads.
// Improve memory access patterns to reduce the potential for cache thrashing.
