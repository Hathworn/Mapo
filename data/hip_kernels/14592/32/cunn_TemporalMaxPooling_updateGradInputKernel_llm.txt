```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to minimize cache misses.
// Use shared memory for storing frequently accessed data.
// Reduce redundant calculations inside loops.
// Ensure that memory access is coalesced for better performance.
// Use atomic operations cautiously as they can lead to serialization among threads.
