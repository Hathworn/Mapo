```
// Suggestion: Align memory accesses to optimize coalesced memory reads
// Suggestion: Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Suggestion: Minimize strided access pattern for improved memory efficiency
// Suggestion: Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase parallel execution
// Suggestion: Precompute commonly used expressions to reduce computational overhead
