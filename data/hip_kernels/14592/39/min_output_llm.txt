// Consider coalesced memory access for input array to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Utilize shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp complete similar operations
// Explore use of atomic operations for reduction to avoid race conditions
