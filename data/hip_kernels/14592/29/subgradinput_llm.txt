```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to increase bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory load/store operations.
// Evaluate optimal block size for memory-bound operations to improve performance.
// Reorder data structures in memory for better cache locality.
// Minimize redundant calculations outside the loop where applicable.
// Assess if loop unrolling can be increased to enhance performance.
