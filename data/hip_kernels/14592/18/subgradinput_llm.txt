// Consider using shared memory to cache the kernel weights to reduce repeated global memory access.
// Use constant memory for the weights if they fit to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns for gradInput and gradOutput.
// Apply loop unrolling strategies effectively where beneficial, as demonstrated.
