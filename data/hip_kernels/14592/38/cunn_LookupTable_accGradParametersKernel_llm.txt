```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring input and indices arrays are accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results like gradient and weight to reduce global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling to enhance memory access efficiency in the weight update section.
// Reduce divergence by optimizing the condition inside the main loop.
// Ensure that memory access patterns are aligned to improve memory throughput.
