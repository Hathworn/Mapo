```cpp
// Consider using memory coalescing for input and gradOutput accesses.
// Use shared memory more effectively to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling for ky and kx loops for better performance.
// Ensure optimal block size based on hardware capabilities for compute efficiency.
// Minimize use of atomic operations by reducing data in shared memory first.
// Consider using float4 or float2 for vectorized memory access where applicable.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by padding shared memory accesses.
