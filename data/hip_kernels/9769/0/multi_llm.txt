```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns and reduce global memory accesses
// Explore memory coalescing to ensure continuous memory access patterns for better throughput
// Ensure loop unrolling is effectively applied for the specific width sizes to avoid overhead
// Verify the use of __restrict__ qualifiers if applicable to help the compiler optimize memory access
