// Use loop unrolling to minimize thread divergence and improve memory access patterns
// Consider using warp level primitives for reduction instead of atomic operations
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory accesses across threads in a warp
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits to prevent bank conflicts
// Experiment with different block sizes for better performance depending on hardware constraints
// Evaluate if using texture memory could provide benefits over global memory for frequent reads
