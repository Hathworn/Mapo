```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved global memory efficiency.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory read accesses.
// Utilize vectorized loading (e.g., float4) to decrease memory transaction overhead.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by optimizing parallel reduction.
// Evaluate using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from caching.
// Test various block sizes to achieve optimal occupancy and performance.
