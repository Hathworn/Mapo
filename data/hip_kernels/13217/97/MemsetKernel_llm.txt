// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access, if applicable.
// Launch kernel with optimal block size for maximum occupancy and efficiency.
// Evaluate if using warp-level reduction techniques can enhance performance.
