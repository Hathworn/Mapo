// Use shared memory if frequent access to loc_ is needed and size allows
// Consider coalesced memory access for loc_ if possible
// Align scale calculations to leverage FMA operations if hardware supports
// Ensure x and y arrays are aligned to enable vectorized writes
// Evaluate if loop unrolling benefits when processing large datasets
