```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses
// Align data structures for coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced when reading from both 'u' and 'v' arrays
// Use loop unrolling if there are any loops that can be unrolled to enhance performance
// Investigate the usage of the __restrict__ qualifier to improve memory access patterns
// Inspect whether using read-only data caches (__ldg) for constant data is beneficial
