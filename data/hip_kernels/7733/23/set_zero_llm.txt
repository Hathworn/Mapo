```
// Consider using __restrict__ to indicate non-aliasing pointers for better optimization
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize warp divergence by reducing conditional branches within the kernel
// Use shared memory if the same data is read multiple times by threads
// Consider launching a 1D grid if the second dimension is unnecessary to decrease overhead
