```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency
// Utilize shared memory if reuse within thread block is possible to reduce global memory access
// Investigate if loop unrolling can optimize the instruction throughput
// Ensure that the block and grid configuration match the GPU architecture for optimal occupancy
