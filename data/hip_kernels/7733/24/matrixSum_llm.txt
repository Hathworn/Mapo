```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive data elements
// Optimize memory access pattern to avoid bank conflicts
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access if needed
// Align data with memory boundaries for optimal access speed
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize global memory latency
// Ensure grid and block configuration maximizes warp occupancy
