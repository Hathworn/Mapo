```
// Check boundaries once to reduce conditional checks inside the critical computation.
// Use shared memory to store shared data across threads and avoid redundant global memory accesses.
// Coalesce memory accesses for better utilization of the memory bandwidth.
// Consider using warp shuffles for intra-warp communication when necessary.
