//Consider coalesced memory access for Beta and Inverse to improve throughput
//Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
//Evaluate if loop unrolling benefits apply to reduce overhead
//Consider employing __restrict__ qualifiers to improve compiler optimizations
//Assess the use of a faster approximation for erf(t0) if precision allows
