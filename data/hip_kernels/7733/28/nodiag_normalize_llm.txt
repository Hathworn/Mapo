```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently used data
// Reduce redundant computations by precomputing reciprocal and use multiple threads to perform iteration tasks
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and improve performance if loops are present
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns
// Optimize thread and block configuration to maximize GPU occupancy based on empirical testing
