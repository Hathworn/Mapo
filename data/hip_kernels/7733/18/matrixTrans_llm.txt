// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Tile dimensions include padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Ensure threads are synchronized before accessing shared memory
// Transpose indices to improve coalesced memory access
// Optimize block and grid sizes for best occupancy given hardware constraints
