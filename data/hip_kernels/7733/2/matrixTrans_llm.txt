```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting row-major or column-major order based on GPU architecture
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory throughput
// If the matrix is large, consider tiling to maximize data reuse in the cache
// Ensure that grid and block dimensions are configured to fully utilize GPU resources
// Try loop unrolling manually or use compiler hints if applicable for repetitive memory operations
