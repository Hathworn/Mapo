```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to cache diag if multiple accesses occur, to reduce global memory reads.
// Minimize branching or divergent code in kernels for better warp execution efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifiers to help the compiler optimize memory accesses.
