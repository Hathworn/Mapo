```
// Use shared memory to cache elements of A and I to reduce global memory access.
// Apply loop unrolling to optimize memory operations within the kernel.
// Incorporate coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditionals where possible.
// Leverage warp-level primitives to optimize parallel reductions if applicable.
