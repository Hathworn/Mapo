```c
// Consider unrolling loops for better performance.
// Explore shared memory usage to reduce global memory access latency.
// Evaluate use of warp-level primitives for efficient synchronization.
// Experiment with optimal block size for maximizing device occupancy.
// Avoid redundant calculations within the nested conditions.
