```
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Consider using float instead of double for improved performance and memory usage
// Ensure TILE_DIM is set optimally based on the GPU architecture and shared memory size
// Use constant memory for input matrices if they remain unchanged during execution
// Experiment with loop unrolling for the tile multiplication loop to reduce loop overhead
