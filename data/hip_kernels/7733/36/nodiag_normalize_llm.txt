```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for diag_value
// Minimize conditional checks within kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
// Coalesced memory accesses could be ensured by restructuring matrix storage layout
// Investigate using atomic operations for concurrent writes if needed
// Evaluate thread block size for optimal occupancy and memory latency
