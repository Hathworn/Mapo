```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize loop unrolling for operations inside the conditional blocks to improve performance.
// Minimize branch divergence by structuring if statements to evenly distribute execution paths.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency of memory access.
