// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data locality
// Add padding to shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Load data into shared memory only if within bounds to avoid illegal memory access
// Ensure threads synchronize after loading to shared memory to guarantee data coherence
// Write back to global memory only if within bounds to avoid illegal memory access
