```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp take the same execution path
// Prefetch data to shared memory to hide memory latency
// Align shared memory accesses to improve bandwidth
// Use loop unrolling if it improves performance on target architecture
// Optimize tile size (blocksize) for better occupancy and resource usage
```
