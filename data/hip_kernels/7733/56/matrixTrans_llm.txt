```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Make sure to define TILE_DIM as a macro or constant value
// Align shared memory allocation to improve memory access coalescing
// Prefer a TILE_DIM that divides the data dimensions evenly
// Adjust TILE_DIM to match hardware's warp size for optimal performance
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before reading from shared memory
// Promote memory requests coalescing when writing to and reading from global memory
// Consider loop unrolling within tiles for additional performance gains
