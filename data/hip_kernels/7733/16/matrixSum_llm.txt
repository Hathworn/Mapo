// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same matrix elements
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to enhance occupancy and performance
// Experiment with memory access patterns for optimal L2 cache utilization
