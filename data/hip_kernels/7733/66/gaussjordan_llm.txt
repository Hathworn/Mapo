```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring adjacent threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Consider loop unrolling for operations that are applied over small and fixed-size ranges
// Optimize memory access patterns to leverage memory coalescing and reduce bank conflicts
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing common sub-expressions in registers
