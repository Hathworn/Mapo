```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential memory access
// Minimize thread divergence by handling boundary conditions
// Ensure that shared memory is utilized effectively to store tile sub-matrices
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory
