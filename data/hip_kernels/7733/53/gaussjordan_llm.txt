```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for A and I
// Minimize global memory access by loading data in blocks
// Use loop unrolling where applicable for reduced instruction overhead
// Ensure memory coalescing for improved bandwidth utilization
// Consider warp-level primitives for synchronization where necessary
// Evaluate thread block size for optimal performance
```
