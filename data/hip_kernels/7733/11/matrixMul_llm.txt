```
// Consider using shared memory to cache submatrices and reduce redundant global memory access
// Review the memory access pattern to ensure coalesced access within the global memory
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to minimize loop overhead and enhance performance
// Utilize appropriate synchronization if shared memory is used to avoid race conditions
// Evaluate the block and grid size configuration to optimize the execution efficiency
