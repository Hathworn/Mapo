// Consider using shared memory if accessing elements repeatedly
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures
// Optimize block and grid sizes based on the hardware for better load balancing
// Use __restrict__ keyword to improve memory access times
// Prefetch data into L1/L2 cache if supported by the architecture
