```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Consider using a warp shuffle operation to reduce synchronization overhead
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access during up-sweep and down-sweep
// Ensure blkData access patterns are fully coalesced and prevent memory divergence
// Optimize memory access by avoiding redundant loads and stores
