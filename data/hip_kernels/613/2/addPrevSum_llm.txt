```
// Use shared memory for blkSumsScan if reuse across threads to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for prefix sums within blocks for faster processing
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring condition checks are warp-friendly
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses for better memory throughput
