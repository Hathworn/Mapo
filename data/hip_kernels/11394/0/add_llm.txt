```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory fetch efficiency.
// Ensure the data is aligned for enhancing memory access speed.
// Utilize shared memory if the operations become more complex to reduce global memory access overhead.
// Minimize the usage of global memory to decrease memory latency.
