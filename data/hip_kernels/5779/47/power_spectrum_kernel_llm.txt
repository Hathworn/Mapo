```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase access speed
// Load data into shared memory in a coalesced manner for better performance
// Adjust the size of shared memory based on actual requirements to prevent memory waste
// Avoid unnecessary loading or processing by skipping idx == 0 case early
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions if appropriate to reduce shared memory usage
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper indexing
