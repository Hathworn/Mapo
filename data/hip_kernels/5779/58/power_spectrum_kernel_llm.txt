```
// Consider coalesced accesses for both reading input and writing output to improve memory access efficiency
// Exploit shared memory to temporarily store data and reduce global memory transactions
// Minimize divergence within warp by reordering conditional statements for better performance
// Optimize data alignment and padding to prevent misaligned memory access
