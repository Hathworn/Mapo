```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for reading and writing
// Potentially increase block size for better occupancy and throughput
// Align shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to minimize synchronization overhead
// Optimize for L1/L2 cache usage for better memory hierarchy utilization
