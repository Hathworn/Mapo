```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory addresses accessed by threads
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring all threads within a warp take the same execution path
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to further enhance performance
// Verify that grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy
// Look into prefetching data to optimize memory access latency
