```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for repeated data
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure data alignment to avoid unaligned memory accesses which can degrade performance
// Evaluate the use of vectorized data operations to increase throughput
// Opt for appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize GPU occupancy
