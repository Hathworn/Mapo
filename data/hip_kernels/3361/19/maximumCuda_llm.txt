```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for all in1, in2, and out arrays
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Evaluate if using vectorized data types (e.g., uint8x4_t) could benefit memory access patterns
// Use memory alignment where possible to minimize access latency
// Assess if loop unrolling could provide performance benefits in this section
