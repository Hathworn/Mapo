// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for point data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure that shared memory usage is kept within hardware limits to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider coalesced access patterns for global memory reads where possible to improve performance.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize data loading into shared memory across threads in a block.
