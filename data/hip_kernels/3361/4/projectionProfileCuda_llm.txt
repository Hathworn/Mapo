```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal access patterns
// Use warp-level primitives if possible to reduce synchronization overhead
```
