```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input tiles for better memory access patterns.
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures according to warp size.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses by using padding if necessary.
// Use read-only memory caches for input arrays if supported by the architecture.
