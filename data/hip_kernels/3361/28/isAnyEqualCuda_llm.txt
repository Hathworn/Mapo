```
// Consider using a more specialized memory layout for shared memory to prevent bank conflicts
// Preload sharedValues into registers for each thread to minimize shared memory usage inside loop
// Optimize loop unrolling for the check equality section to reduce branch divergence
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize the reduction logic for checking equality
