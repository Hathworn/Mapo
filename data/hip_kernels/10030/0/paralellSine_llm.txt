```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory if possible to store input and intermediate values for reduced global memory accesses.
// Minimize register usage and avoid spilling to improve thread execution efficiency.
// Optimize thread divergence by ensuring logical conditions lead to uniform branching within the warp.
