```
// Ensure a proper grid size to cover the entire input matrices
// Consider using asynchronous copy operations for loading into shared memory
// Optimize memory layout to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Use double buffering technique to overlap computation and memory operations
// Employ atomic operations if accumulation is needed across different threads or blocks
