```cpp
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for performance
// Utilize shared memory for data reuse if applicable
// Use __restrict__ pointers to inform compiler for possible optimizations
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel for efficiency
// Tune block and grid sizes based on empirical testing for specific hardware
// Consider memory alignment restrictions on newer hardware architectures
```
