```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Minimize branching within the kernel to improve performance
// Consider changing the loop structure to improve warp efficiency 
// Use constant memory for unchanging variables like 'N' and 'k' when passed to the kernel
// Ensure enough threads are launched to cover the full range of data elements efficiently
