```
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns by organizing data access in contiguous blocks to enhance memory bandwidth utilization.
// Reduce shared memory usage where possible to increase concurrent block occupancy.
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated operations to diminish loop control overhead.
// Employ constant memory for k_k1 and k1_k values if accessed frequently, to benefit from faster cache operations.
// Ensure enough threads per block to effectively hide memory latency by maximizing GPU utilization.
// Minimize synchronizations with careful memory access and reduce __syncthreads() usage where possible.
// Consider using warp shuffle functions to share data within a warp efficiently, reducing reliance on shared memory.
