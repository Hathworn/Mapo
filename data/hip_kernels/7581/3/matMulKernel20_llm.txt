```
// Ensure memory access patterns result in coalesced reads
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth demand
// Consider adjusting block size to maximize occupancy
// #pragma unroll helps with loop pipeline optimization
// Ensure dimensions are multiples of block size to avoid boundary checks
// Check for memory bank conflicts in shared memory
