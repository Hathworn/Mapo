```
// Coalesce global memory access for M and N to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider increasing tile size for better data reuse in shared memory
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions
// Experiment with increasing or decreasing unroll factor to find optimal performance
// Use larger blocks if register usage and shared memory allow for it to increase parallelism
