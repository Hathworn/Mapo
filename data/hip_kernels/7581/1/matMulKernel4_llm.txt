```cpp
// Consider using a larger tile size if shared memory allows, to increase data reuse.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations.
// Check occupancy and adjust block size to maximize execution efficiency.
// Explore further unrolling opportunities in the inner loop to potentially enhance performance.
// Evaluate the possibility of using float4 to load/store multiple values at once, to exploit more bandwidth.
