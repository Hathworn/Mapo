```
// Ensure the use of shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Use thread block size to match the tile size for efficient memory access
// Utilize the __syncthreads() function to synchronize threads after loading tiles
// Consider using loop unrolling to improve performance where applicable
// Optimize data alignment in shared memory for better memory coalescing
