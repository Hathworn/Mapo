```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for loading M and N into shared memory
// Consider reducing synchronization points; explore further loop unrolling
// Potentially increase tiling/block size to better exploit shared memory
// Investigate bank conflicts due to shared memory layout
// Reevaluate memory patterns to enhance memory throughput
// Optimize register usage by balancing register pressure and occupancy
