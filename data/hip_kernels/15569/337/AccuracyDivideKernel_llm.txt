```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient collective operations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory operations.
// Utilize atomic operations if multiple threads need to access shared data.
