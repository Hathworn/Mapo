```
// Optimize memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Pre-fetch or cache frequently accessed data to avoid redundant memory reads
// Explore loop unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism and reduce loop overhead
// Assess the use of atomic operations if necessary to ensure correct execution
// Evaluate potential thread divergence and mitigate by restructuring logic
