// Consider changing memory access pattern to coalesced access for A and B.
// Use vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) to improve memory throughput.
// Use registers where possible to reduce shared memory usage.
// Verify if shared memory usage can be further reduced or reused efficiently.
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring uniform memory access patterns.
