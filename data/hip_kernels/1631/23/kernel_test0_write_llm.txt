```
// Check memory access bounds to prevent out-of-bound errors at the start
// Avoid unnecessary type casting by optimizing the loop condition check
// Reduce unnecessary writes by verifying pointer changes before writing
// Write first pattern outside the loop to minimize operations within the loop
// Use bitwise operations efficiently to compute new pointers and patterns
