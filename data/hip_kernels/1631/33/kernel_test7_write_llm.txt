// Consider using __shared__ memory for frequently accessed data to reduce memory latency
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses by all threads in a warp
// Use available memory alignment features to improve memory access efficiency
// Evaluate using warp-level primitives to optimize data shuffling between threads
