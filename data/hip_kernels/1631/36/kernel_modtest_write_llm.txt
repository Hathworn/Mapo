// Use shared memory or registers to minimize global memory access
// Align memory accesses to maximize coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease the number of executed instructions
// Avoid divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
// Ensure that the memory addresses are within valid bounds to prevent undefined behavior
