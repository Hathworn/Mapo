```
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning data structures properly
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths
// Double-check that calculations are vectorized to improve performance
// Avoid unnecessary synchronizations and barriers to reduce overhead
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner dot product and angle calculation loop
