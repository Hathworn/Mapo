```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesced access to pfe_output can improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that x_coors and y_coors accesses are coalesced.
// Optimize register usage to allow for more threads per block.
// Experiment with different block size configurations for optimal performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage, if added.
