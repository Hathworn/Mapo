```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for y pointer to improve memory access performance
// Ensure memory alignment for y array to leverage coalesced memory accesses
// Verify block and grid size are optimal for target GPU architecture to maximize occupancy
// Explore using shared memory if further optimization is needed based on data reuse patterns
// Profile the application to determine if additional tuning of loop unrolling factor can yield better performance
