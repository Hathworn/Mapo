// Consider using shared memory to temporarily store filtered_box and box_for_nms values
// Prefetch data to avoid cache misses and improve memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory access by ensuring threads read sequentially from global memory
// Minimize use of global memory wherever possible to reduce latency
