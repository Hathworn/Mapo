// Use a more efficient method to calculate global thread ID
// Ensure thread is within bounds and directly update the target array
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Explore coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance
// Minimize memory access latency by optimizing the data layout
