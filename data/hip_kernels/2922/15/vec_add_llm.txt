```
// Use __restrict__ keyword for A, B, and C pointers to indicate non-aliasing memory access
// Ensure A, B, and C are aligned by 128 bits for coalesced memory access
// Utilize shared memory if A, B, and C will be reused within the kernel
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency
// Consider memory access patterns to ensure coalescing
