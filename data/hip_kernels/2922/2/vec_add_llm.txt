```
// Use shared memory to store portions of A and B to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using a loop to allow each thread to process multiple elements improving hardware utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring aligned access patterns
// Utilize constant memory for any reusable data that does not change across kernel executions
// Balance the number of threads per block considering the GPU's resources to maximize occupancy
