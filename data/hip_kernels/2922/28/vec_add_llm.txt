```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to improve memory access speed.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory reads for A and B.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for workloads with heavier computations.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to potentially optimize compiler-generated code.
