```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by structuring data to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Optimize the reduction step by minimizing divergence and improving warp efficiency.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory transactions and latency.
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() is necessary to avoid potential performance degradation.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations for potential optimization for small-scale reduction tasks.
