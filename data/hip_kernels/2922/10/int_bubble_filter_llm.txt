```
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce global memory transactions
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for faster access
// Align memory accesses to 32-bit or 64-bit boundaries for coalesced reads
// Ensure all input data is loaded and used to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Use loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce loop control overhead
