```
// Suggest prefetching vec1 elements to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to avoid performance penalties.
// Consider unrolling the inner loop to increase ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Evaluate using warp shuffle operations for data exchange to optimize intra-warp communication.
