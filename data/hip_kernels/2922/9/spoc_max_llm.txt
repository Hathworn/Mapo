```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing.
// Recommend loading multiple elements per thread if possible to utilize bandwidth.
// Ensure properly sized shared memory allocation for reduction.
// Maximize occupancy by experimenting with different block sizes.
// Use `__shared__` keyword efficiently to minimize bank conflicts.
// Evaluate using `HIP_DYNAMIC_SHARED` for dynamic shared memory allocation.
// Utilize warp-level primitives for further reduction optimization.
