```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Prefetch data if applicable to overlap computation with memory access
// Optimize block size to maximize warp efficiency and reduce divergence
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring aligned memory access
// Analyze bank conflicts and minimize them if using shared memory
