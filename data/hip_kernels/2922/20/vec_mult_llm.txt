```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring that data is stored in a contiguous block
// Use shared memory to optimize reuse of data within a block
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers
// Balance workload across threads by ensuring all threads are active
// Make sure that the grid and block dimensions are optimized for your GPU hardware
