```
// Use shared memory to cache A and B for reducing global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced access by aligning A, B, and C with warp boundaries
// Consider loop unrolling within the if statement for increased efficiency
// Minimize divergent branching for the if condition by organizing thread execution
