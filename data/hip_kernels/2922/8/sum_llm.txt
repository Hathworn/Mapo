// Consider using shared memory to reduce bandwidth usage
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring threads within a warp take the same execution path
// Use loop unrolling for the reduction to further optimize performance
// Align memory access to avoid uncoalesced memory reads and writes
// Optimize memory access patterns by arranging data for coalesced accesses
