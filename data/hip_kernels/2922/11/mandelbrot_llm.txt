// Use shared memory to cache 'a' and 'b' values to reduce global memory access
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing for better performance
// Use atomic operations to minimize write conflicts in shared computation scenarios
// Consider using texture memory for frequently accessed read-only data
// Optimize loop termination condition to reduce unnecessary calculations
