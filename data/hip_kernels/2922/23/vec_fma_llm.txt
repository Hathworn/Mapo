```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that A, B, C, and D arrays are aligned appropriately.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory if data reuse within the block is possible for improved memory access latency.
// Use loop unrolling if N is significantly large to reduce loop overhead and potentially improve performance.
// Assess if employing float4 vectors (loading 4 floats at a time) would benefit memory access patterns further.
// Check if memory access patterns can be optimized by transposing data if applicable.
