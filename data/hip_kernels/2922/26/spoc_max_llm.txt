```
// Use coalesced memory access for input array reads to improve memory throughput
// Consider using occupancy API to choose optimal block size for more efficient resource utilization
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use vectorized loads if possible by reading multiple elements per thread
// Evaluate load balancing to ensure even work distribution across threads
