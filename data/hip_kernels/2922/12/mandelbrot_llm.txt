```
// Consider aligning memory access with coalesced memory access patterns
// Avoid shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring memory alignment
// Implement loop unrolling for reducing loop overhead effectively
// Use local variables to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize the division operations, replacing with bit-shift if applicable
// Investigate if prefetching data to registers can improve performance
// Ensure early loop exit conditions to minimize unnecessary computations
