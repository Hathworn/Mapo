```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing consecutive elements
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefer using warp-level primitives for reduction if applicable
// Minimize branch divergence by organizing threads efficiently
// Consider loop unrolling for the iteration over 'n'
