```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses within the block
// Apply further loop unrolling if register usage and performance allow
// Optimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths for all threads
// Evaluate the benefit of using float2 data type to load two float values at once
