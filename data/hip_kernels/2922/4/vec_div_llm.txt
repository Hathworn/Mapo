```
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for A, B, and C
// Ensure that A, B, and C are aligned to improve memory access performance
// Consider utilizing shared memory if A, B, or C are reused
// Adjust block size to achieve optimal occupancy and increase warp efficiency
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to improve throughput
