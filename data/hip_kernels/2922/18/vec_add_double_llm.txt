```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory reads
// Use memory access patterns to coalesce reads and writes for performance
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling if the operation is suitable
// Ensure that memory transfers are asynchronous when possible to overlap computation and data movement
