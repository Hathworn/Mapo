```
// Consider using shared memory for v_norme if subsequent operations are performed to reduce global memory access.
// Use a temporary variable to store VN[i] for reuse in both diff computation and assignment to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure proper alignment of memory accesses to improve coalesced memory access.
