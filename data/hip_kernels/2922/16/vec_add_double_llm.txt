```
// Consider utilizing shared memory for frequently accessed data to optimize memory access patterns.
// Ensure memory coalescing by arranging memory accesses sequentially.
// Optimize data transfer between host and device using pinned memory.
// Utilize asynchronous memory copy operations for overlapping computation and data transfer.
