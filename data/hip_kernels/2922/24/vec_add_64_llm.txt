```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Reduce global memory accesses by reusing intermediate results in registers
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for occupancy and efficiency
// Minimize divergent branching within the kernel
