```
// Reuse precomputed offsets to reduce redundant calculations.
// Minimize global memory accesses by loading flow values once.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better global memory performance.
// Use shared memory when possible to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Optimize boundary checks and atomic operations to minimize warp divergence.
