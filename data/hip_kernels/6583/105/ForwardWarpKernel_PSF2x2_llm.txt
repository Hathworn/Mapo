// Consider optimizing memory accesses by ensuring coalesced reads.
// Use shared memory to store partial results within a block to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize atomic operations where possible, as they can be a bottleneck.
// Consider padding flows for reducing bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Ensure that conditional checks inside the kernel are minimized as they can increase divergence.
