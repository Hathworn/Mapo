```c
// Optimize by aligning data access patterns for coalesced memory access
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use proper memory access patterns to maximize memory bandwidth
// Unroll loops where applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Consider adjusting thread block size for efficient hardware utilization
```
