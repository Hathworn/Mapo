```cpp
// Prefer memory coalescing by aligning data accesses correctly
// Avoid using blockDim.x and blockDim.y multiple times in the loop
// Use shared memory to cache frequent read/write data when possible
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize memory accesses
// Ensure efficient use of the memory hierarchy by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Consider using warp shuffles or shared memory to reduce load/store operations
```
