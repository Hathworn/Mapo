```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns in reading/writing to global memory.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize thread block size to improve memory access patterns.
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution.
// Prefetch data where possible, especially for source image reads.
// Reduce the number of memory transactions by processing multiple pixels per thread.
// Use constants or __restrict__ pointers to optimize memory access.
// Ensure alignment of data structures for optimal global memory access.
