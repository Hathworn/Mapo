// Consider coalesced memory access for srcImageU8 to increase memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store frequently used data in the kernel to reduce global memory access.
// Evaluate memory alignment to ensure optimal access patterns.
// Investigate vectorized load/store operations to optimize memory transactions.
// Examine using __ldg() function for read-only data to utilize texture cache.
