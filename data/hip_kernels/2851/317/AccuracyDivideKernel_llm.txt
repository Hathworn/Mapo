```
// Consider using shared memory if the accuracy value is computed in each block
// Perform the division on the CPU if possible to avoid kernel launch overhead
// Ensure that accuracy is effectively cached to reduce global memory access time
// Assess if multiple kernel calls can be merged to reduce launch latency
