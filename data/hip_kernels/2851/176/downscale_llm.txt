```cpp
// Consider optimizing global memory access patterns for coalescence
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Reduce memory divergence by aligning data accesses across threads
// Minimize redundant calculations by storing reused values in registers
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
```
