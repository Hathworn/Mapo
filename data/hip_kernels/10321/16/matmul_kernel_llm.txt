```
// Load elements from global to shared memory using coalesced access patterns.
// Increase tile size to allow more data reuse in shared memory.
// Unroll loops to improve instruction-level parallelism and increase throughput.
// Use a blocking mechanism to divide workloads and maximize shared memory usage.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring data is accessed contiguously.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide global memory latency.
// Balance computation and memory access to optimize for latency and throughput.
