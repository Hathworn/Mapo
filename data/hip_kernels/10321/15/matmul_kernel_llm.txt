```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Unroll loops to exploit instruction-level parallelism
// Employ __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after each shared memory load
// Adjust block_size_x and block_size_y for optimal occupancy and performance
