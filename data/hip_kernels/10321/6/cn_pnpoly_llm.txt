```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access when storing intermediate results
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to the 'points' array for improved performance
// Precompute slopes outside the kernel if possible and use constant memory for 'd_vertices' and 'd_slopes'
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve throughput
