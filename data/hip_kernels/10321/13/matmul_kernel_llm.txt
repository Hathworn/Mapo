```
// Use shared memory to cache submatrices for faster access
// Load tiles into shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Utilize loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism
// Ensure __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Minimize divergence by avoiding conditional statements in the compute loop
// Prefer reading from shared memory to global memory for frequently accessed data
// Write results back to global memory using a coalesced access pattern
