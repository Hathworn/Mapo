```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for A_in and A_out
// Use shared memory to cache intermediate results for better performance
// Replace sqrtf with an approximation function for faster computation if precision is not critical
// Ensure float2 struct is used optimally to leverage vectorized operations
// Minimize divergent branching, especially inside loops
