// Consider using shared memory to cache Ar and Aw values for memory access optimization.
// Explore the possibility of using __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data from global memory.
// Review memory coalescing by ensuring Aw[idx] is accessed consecutively.
// Ensure gridDim.x and blockDim.x are optimized based on the device architecture.
