```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if multiple threads access the same data.
// Optimize data alignment for memory access; consider using float4 types for higher throughput.
// Use loop unrolling if there's a repeated computational pattern to reduce loop overhead.
// Evaluate occupancy and ensure enough threads per block to utilize GPU resources fully.
