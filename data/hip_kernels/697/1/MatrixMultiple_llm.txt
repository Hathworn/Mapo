```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses to maximize memory bandwidth
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal performance
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Use constant memory for filter if it remains the same for multiple kernel invocations
