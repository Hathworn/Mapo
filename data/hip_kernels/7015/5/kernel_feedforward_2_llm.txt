```
// Focus on coalesced memory access patterns to minimize global memory transactions.
// Consider loop unrolling where feasible to improve arithmetic throughput and 
// memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure memory access is aligned for better performance.
// Evaluate the appropriate block and thread dimensions to maximize occupancy.
