```
// Consider coalesced access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent branches inside the kernel
// Ensure that the grid dimension is optimized for the GPU being used
// Load multiple elements per thread if possible to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Try to keep occupancy high by maximizing the usage of threads per block
