```
// Store frequently accessed values used in calculations to reduce memory access latency
// Use shared memory efficiently and consider reducing bank conflicts for optimal access
// Consider optimizing the grid and block size for better occupancy and performance
// Utilize warp-level primitives if possible for more efficient reductions
