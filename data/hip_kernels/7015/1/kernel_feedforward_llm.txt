```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for w_arr and a_arr to improve memory performance
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned and use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory traffic
// Evaluate using warp shuffle instructions for reduction operations to further optimize performance
// Explore asynchronous memory transfers to overlap data movement with computation
