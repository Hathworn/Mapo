```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed values like 'z_arr' for better memory access speed.
// Ensure memory coalescing in 'gjl' array updates to optimize global memory access.
// Check if 'a_arr' and 't_arr' can be accessed in a coalesced manner to improve performance.
// Minimize the use of 'expf' function within the critical path to reduce computational overhead.
