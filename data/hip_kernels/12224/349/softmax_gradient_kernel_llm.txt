```
// Consider coalesced memory access for dY, Y, and dX to enhance memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by choosing the number of threads per block that best fits the GPU's architecture.
// Examine using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead where applicable.
// Utilize memory prefetching strategies to hide memory latencies.
