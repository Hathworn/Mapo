```
// Reduce memory access by using shared memory for intermediate results
// Minimize warp divergence by iterating over elements with a stride-based approach
// Optimize reductions by reducing the number of synchronization barriers
// Use a single thread to write final block results to global memory to avoid redundant access
```
