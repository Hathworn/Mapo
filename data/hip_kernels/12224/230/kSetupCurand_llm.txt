```
// Consider using shared memory to store data for threads within the same block to increase memory access efficiency.
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions optimally cover the desired computational domain to minimize unused threads.
// Optimize the memory layout for consecutive threads to access contiguous memory locations and improve memory coalescing.
// Use constant memory for data that doesn't change during kernel execution and is accessed repeatedly by threads.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could be applicable for operations within the kernel to reduce loop overhead.
// Assess if any computations can be precomputed outside the kernel and passed as arguments to the kernel.
