```
// Use shared memory for caching gradOutput_data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Unroll the inner loop completely to minimize loop overhead and improve performance.
// Arrange threads to maximize coalesced memory access for gradOutput_data.
// Optimize thread block size and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance.
// Minimize divergent branching by refactoring condition checks within the kernel.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
