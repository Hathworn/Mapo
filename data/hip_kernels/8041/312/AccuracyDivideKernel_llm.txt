// Use shared memory to minimize global memory transactions
// Only thread 0 accesses global memory to avoid race conditions and reduce memory access latency
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory value is consistent across threads
// Initialize shared memory outside the division to minimize computation in global memory
