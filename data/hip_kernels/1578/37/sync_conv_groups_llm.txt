```c
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to avoid serialization
// Use warp-level primitives when appropriate for better sync performance
```
