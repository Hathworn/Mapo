```
// Use coalesced memory access when reading input data
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for input and output pointers to assume no aliasing
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to optimize occupancy and balance load
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of shared memory for improved efficiency
// Opt for a warp-wide reduction step to minimize the number of __syncthreads() needed
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits to prevent bank conflicts
// Use atomic operations efficiently to reduce contention when updating output value
