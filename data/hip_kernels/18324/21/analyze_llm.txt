```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for input array
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring all threads participate equally
// Optimize the block size to utilize available shared memory effectively
// Use occupations to analyze and fine-tune the occupancy level
// Ensure the number of threads per block is a multiple of warp size
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching if appropriate
