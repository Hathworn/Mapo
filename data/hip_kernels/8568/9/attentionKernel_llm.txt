```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loading data into shared memory
// Ensure block size is a multiple of warp size for optimal performance
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for the summation computation
// Allocate enough shared memory to avoid out-of-bound accesses
// Use __syncthreads() effectively to ensure synchronization
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization after computation
```
