```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for bias
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory is fully populated before use
// Utilize block and thread indexing to optimize memory access patterns
// Consider loading bias into shared memory only when beneficial to balance overhead
```
