```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced access in global memory for output and pre_grad arrays
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory loading is completed
// Leverage loop unrolling if applicable for further performance improvement
