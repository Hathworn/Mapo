```
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for the image and results to improve memory coalescing.
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching to reduce memory latency for psf data.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only psf data to take advantage of caching.
// Optimize shared memory use by minimizing shared memory size or using double buffering if necessary.
// Unroll loops where beneficial to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.
