```cpp
// Load input node into shared memory for coalesced memory access
// Ensure all threads are synchronized after loading shared memory
// Optimize reduction through loop unrolling if possible
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for the final reduction
// Store partial results to global memory with consideration of memory coalescing
