```
// Consider coalesced memory access for input_cuda to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Explore use of float2, float4 types for input_node to utilize vectorized memory operations
// Investigate the possibility of using shared memory for hidden_partial_sum in partial reduction
// Ensure coalesced access for input_hidden_cuda to improve access speed
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts in weight_matrix
// Utilize thread-level parallelism effectively during the reduction process
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to prevent unnecessary synchronization overhead
