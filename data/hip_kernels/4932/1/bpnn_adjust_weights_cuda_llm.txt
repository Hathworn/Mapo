```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for delta and ly arrays.
// Ensure BLOCK_DIM_X and BLOCK_DIM_Y are optimal for your hardware.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory latency.
// Evaluate moving oldw and w accesses to shared memory if frequently accessed.
// Be cautious of bank conflicts in shared memory operations.
// Test for optimal thread block size for maximum hardware occupancy.
// Ensure stride accesses are minimized for global memory bandwidth optimization.
