```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for the normalization_factor array to enhance memory throughput
// Evaluate the potential use of shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads for normalization_factor
// Explore the possibility of using __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data like normalization_factor to utilize readonly cache
// Assess the impact of memory alignment on the normalization_factor array for optimal loading performance
// Optimize global memory access patterns by ensuring that image array accesses are coalesced
// Investigate loop unrolling strategies if applicable to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure that the use of shared memory is within the limits to prevent performance degradation due to bank conflicts
