```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory more efficiently to reduce bank conflicts
// Minimize number of __syncthreads() to only necessary points
// Use warp-synchronous programming when possible for reductions
// Align the shared memory accesses for coalescing
