```
// Consider aligning memory access for coalesced reads and writes.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts.
// Unroll the inner loops for better performance.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() where possible.
// Optimize data reuse by keeping frequently accessed data in registers.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size if necessary.
