// Consider using shared memory to store neighboring elements for better memory coalescing.
// Minimize redundant accesses to global memory by loading critical elements into registers or shared memory.
// Ensure that thread indices do not exceed the bounds of the array to avoid invalid memory accesses.
// Align data structures to enable coalesced memory access and ensure optimal global memory throughput.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
