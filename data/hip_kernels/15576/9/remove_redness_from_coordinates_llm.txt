```
// Coalesced memory access by iterating over coordinates in reverse.
// Precompute image size outside of the loop for repetitive use.
// Use ushort2 for 2D coordinate representation to optimize memory usage.
// Use min/max to ensure memory accesses are within legitimate bounds.
// Precompute clamped 1D index for repeated use to save computation.
// Use local variables to hold frequently accessed values like g_value and b_value.
