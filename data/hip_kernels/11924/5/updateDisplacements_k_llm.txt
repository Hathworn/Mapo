// Optimize force accumulation using registers
// Use registers instead of local variables to reduce memory access time

// Minimize memory reads by utilizing registers
// Load frequently accessed data into registers to reduce global memory reads

// Optimize calculations to a single line per component
// Reduce arithmetic operations by combining calculations into fewer lines
