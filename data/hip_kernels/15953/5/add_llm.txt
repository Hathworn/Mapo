// Reduce global memory access by using shared memory for data exchange
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning shared memory access with threadIdx.x
// Synchronize threads correctly to ensure data consistency across shared memory
// Consider double buffering in shared memory for overlapping compute and data transfer
