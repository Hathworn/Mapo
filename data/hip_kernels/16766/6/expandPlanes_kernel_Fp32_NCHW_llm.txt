// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access memory sequentially.
// Consider enhancing warp usage by minimizing control divergence within warps.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory reads by preloading data.
// Optimize data transfer by maximizing the use of shared memory for masks and values.
// Consider optimizing memory fence usage to ensure synchronization is efficient.
