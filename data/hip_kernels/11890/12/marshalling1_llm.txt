```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory accesses if shared memory were incorporated
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce instruction overhead
// Profile and optimize thread occupancy for best performance
// Verify memory alignment for optimal coalesced accesses
