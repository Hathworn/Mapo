```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data blocks to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize overhead from loop control and potentially increase performance.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses whenever possible.
// Evaluate the impact of different thread block and grid sizes to optimize the kernel launch configuration.
