// Optimization: Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimization: Use coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Optimization: Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Optimization: Group threads in a block to reduce synchronization overhead
// Optimization: Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
