```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for input_itemsets and reference arrays
// Utilize shared memory for frequent data to reduce global memory access overhead
// Minimize divergence by merging conditions for early return
// Inspect memory access patterns for dst array to ensure memory write efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for further performance gains
