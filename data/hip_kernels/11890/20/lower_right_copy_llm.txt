```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Use shared memory to store portions of input_itemsets and reference arrays to reduce global memory accesses
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling or replacing conditional statements with warp-level primitives for efficiency
// Investigate the use of asynchronous memory operations to hide memory latency
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for full occupancy
