```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better throughput
// Ensure grid dimensions and block dimensions optimize memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Align data structures to facilitate vectorized memory transactions
// Adjust block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and minimal memory latency
