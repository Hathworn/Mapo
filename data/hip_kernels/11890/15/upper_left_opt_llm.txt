```
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'dst' and 'input_itemsets' arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Minimize branch divergence by rearranging or simplifying conditions
// Prefetch data to registers if possible to hide memory access latency
// Ensure 100% occupancy by choosing an optimal combination of block size and grid size
