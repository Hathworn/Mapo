// Consider coalesced memory access for input_itemsets by rearranging data layout
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Minimize branching for improved warp execution efficiency
// Evaluate potential loop unrolling for performance gains
// Investigate usage of asynchronous memory operations for latency hiding
// Optimize block size and grid configuration for better occupancy
