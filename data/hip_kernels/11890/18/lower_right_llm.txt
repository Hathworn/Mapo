```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for dst, input_itemsets, and reference arrays.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads for input_itemsets and reference.
// Explore loop unrolling within the maximum function to improve performance.
// Examine potential for arithmetic intensity improvement by combining multiple operations.
