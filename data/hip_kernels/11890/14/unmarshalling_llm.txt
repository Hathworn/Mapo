```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input_itemsets and tmp arrays.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data.
// Analyze warp divergence and restructure conditions if necessary to improve performance.
// Ensure loop unrolling where applicable to maximize throughput.
// Assess grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and memory throughput.
