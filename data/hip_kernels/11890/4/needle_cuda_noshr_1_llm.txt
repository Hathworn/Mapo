// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data and minimizing bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling strategically to improve instruction throughput and reduce overhead.
// Explore the use of constant memory for globally accessed constants to reduce memory latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly.
