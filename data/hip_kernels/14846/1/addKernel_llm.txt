```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Utilize shared memory if data reuse within blocks is possible
// Adjust block and thread dimensions to optimize for memory throughput and occupancy
// Consider using memory prefetching to hide latency
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning conditions within warps
```
