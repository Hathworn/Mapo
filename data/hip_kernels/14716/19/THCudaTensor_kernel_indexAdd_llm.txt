```
// Consider employing shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns
// Investigate loop unrolling inside the for-loop for potential performance gain
// Align memory accesses to 128/256 bits when possible for optimal usage of memory bandwidth
// Minimize use of atomic operations, evaluate possibility of partial sums in shared memory
