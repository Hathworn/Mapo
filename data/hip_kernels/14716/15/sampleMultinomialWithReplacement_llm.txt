```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to improve compiler optimization
// Use coalesced memory accesses when accessing normDistPrefixSum to reduce memory latency
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads where possible to reduce synchronization overhead
// Load prefix sums into shared memory in a coalesced manner to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Ensure sharedPrefixSum is accessed in a coalesced manner to improve memory throughput
// Consider double buffering if accessing shared memory becomes a bottleneck
// Utilize warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations for multinomial sampling
