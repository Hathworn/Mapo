```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for input and kernel to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring all threads have a local copy of frequently used data
// Minimize thread divergence in the reduction across threads section
// Consider loop unrolling for the convolution loop to reduce loop overhead
// Use double buffering in shared memory to overlap computation and communication
// Align data structures to improve cache utilization where possible
