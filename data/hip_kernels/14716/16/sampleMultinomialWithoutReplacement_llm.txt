```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequent data access.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce thread divergence.
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for better cache utilization.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to avoid serialization.
// Ensure alignment for memory reads and writes for better performance.
