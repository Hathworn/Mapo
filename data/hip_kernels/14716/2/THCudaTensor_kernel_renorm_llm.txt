```cpp
// Use shared memory for parallel accumulation to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider using a loop unrolling technique for better performance during norm calculation
// Implemented parallel reduction within shared memory to minimize warp divergence
// Ensure coalesced memory access by processing contiguous elements in threads
// Introduce bank conflict avoidance in shared memory access pattern
// Scale values in parallel to ensure efficient renormalization
