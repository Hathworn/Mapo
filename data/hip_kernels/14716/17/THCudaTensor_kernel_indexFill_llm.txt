```
// Optimize coefficient calculation by reducing redundant computations
// Move index calculation outside of loop over i, as it remains constant
// Consider adjusting thread block size to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory access when accessing the index array
// Utilize shared memory if beneficial for stride and computation reuse
// Evaluate use of restrict qualifiers for pointers to enhance compiler optimizations
