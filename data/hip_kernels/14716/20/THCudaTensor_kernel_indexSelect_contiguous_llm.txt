// Ensure memory coalescing in accesses to tensor[targetIdx + featureIdx] and src[srcIdx + featureIdx]
// Use shared memory to further optimize memory load and store patterns within the blocks
// Consider adjusting VT for optimal warp utilization and minimizing shared memory bank conflicts
// Minimize divergence by ensuring consistent warp execution path
