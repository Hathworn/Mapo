```
// Use shared memory to store partial results within each block to reduce global memory access.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Ensure index array is stored in read-only cache to minimize redundant global memory reads.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Minimize the number of calculations inside the loop by analyzing access patterns and pre-computing reused values.
// If possible, adjust data layout to ensure memory coalescing and reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
