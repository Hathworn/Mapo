```
// Leverage shared memory for histogram computation to reduce global memory accesses
// Use thread block for shared memory initialization to increase efficiency
// Optimize memory accesses by increasing coalescence for read operations
// Utilize atomic operations on shared memory for conflict-free updates before writing back
// Sync threads post shared memory updates to ensure consistency across the block
// Move data from shared to global memory using all threads to avoid warp divergence
