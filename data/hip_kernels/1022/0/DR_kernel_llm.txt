```
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data access to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for D and R arrays to optimize coalesced memory access.
// Utilize warp-level operations to reduce the number of atomic operations.
// Investigate replacing atomic operations with warp shuffle operations for shared memory reduction.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for the j loop to reduce overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Avoid calculating repetitive values like constants in acosf and radian conversion outside the loop.
