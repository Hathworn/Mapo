```
// Use shared memory to reduce the frequency of global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory from global memory only once per block
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have the updated shared memory value
// Perform calculations in shared memory to reduce access latency
// Write results from shared memory back to global memory with minimized contention
