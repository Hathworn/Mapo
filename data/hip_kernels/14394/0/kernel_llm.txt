```c
// Ensure data is coalesced by aligning memory access patterns
// Use shared memory if data requires frequent access by threads
// Consider employing loop unrolling for repetitive operations
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
// Utilize asynchronous memory operations if available
```
