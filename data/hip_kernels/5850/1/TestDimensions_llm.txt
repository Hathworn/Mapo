```
// Use const memory for thread_id calculation components if they are constant
// Avoid unnecessary recalculation of num_threads_per_block and num_blocks
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within the block
// Minimize usage of printf in kernels for better performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for thread_id if accessing arrays
