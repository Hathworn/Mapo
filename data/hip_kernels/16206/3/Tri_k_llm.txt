```c
// Use shared memory to improve access speed for frequently used data.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning data used by each thread.
// Preload data into registers to minimize memory fetch latency.
// Consider using loop unrolling for fixed-size operations.
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for coalescence.
// Reduce divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency.
