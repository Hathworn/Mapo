// Consider coalescing memory accesses by using contiguous threads to access continuous memory locations for 'payoff'
// Ensure that 'spotSize' and 'strike' are loaded into shared memory if reused across multiple threads to reduce global memory reads
// Analyze memory access pattern to ensure optimal usage of hardware capabilities, such as memory banks or caches
