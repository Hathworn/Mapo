```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loading inputs into shared memory
// Ensure full utilization of shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts when accessing su, sp_d, sp_m, sp_u
// Consider vectorization or loop unrolling to increase computation throughput
// Prefetch data to shared memory before computation to hide memory latency
