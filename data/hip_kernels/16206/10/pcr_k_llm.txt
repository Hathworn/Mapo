```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data, minimizing global memory accesses.
// Ensure the reduction and permutation phases use the shared memory effectively for parallelism.
// Utilize thread synchronization effectively to ensure data consistency after write operations to shared memory.
// Optimize memory coalescing by minimizing strided access patterns where possible.
