// Prefetch dx exponentiation and index computation outside the conditional to reduce computation
// Use simple range checks to minimize branches and improve performance
// Use conditional expression without multiplication to simplify calculations
// Avoid uninitialized assignments by explicitly setting payoff to zero when condition is not met
