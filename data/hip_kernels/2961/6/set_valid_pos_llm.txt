// Load count_buff into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory
// Ensure all shared memory operations are complete before proceeding
// Optimize valid position computation using shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() again to finalize shared memory updates
