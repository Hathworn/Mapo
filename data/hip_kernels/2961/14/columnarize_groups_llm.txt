// Minimize memory accesses by using larger data types for copying where applicable.
// Use alignment techniques to improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider coalescing memory reads by aligning threads to data structure boundaries.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses where possible.
// Analyze memory access patterns for potential cache benefits by reordering operations.
