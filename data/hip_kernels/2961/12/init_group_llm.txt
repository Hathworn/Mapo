```
// Consider using shared memory to cache col_widths and init_vals to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize thread-ordering by ensuring memory coalescing on accesses to groups.
// Use warp-level primitive functions to maximize memory access efficiency within a warp.
// Investigate potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage and minimize them.
