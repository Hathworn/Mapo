```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for matrices
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns for matrices a and b
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced for matrix c by using contiguous memory layout
// Evaluate the block and grid sizes for maximizing SM occupancy and performance
// Utilize GPU-specific features such as warp shuffle for reducing memory latency
