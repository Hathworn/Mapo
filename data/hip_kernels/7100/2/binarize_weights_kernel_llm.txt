```c
// Consider aligning data access to improve memory throughput
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Use warp-level parallelism to compute mean more efficiently
// Check for coalesced memory access to ensure optimal access pattern
```
