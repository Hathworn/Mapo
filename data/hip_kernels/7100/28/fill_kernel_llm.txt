```
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same elements
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring X is accessed consecutively
// Ensure ALPHA is stored in a register for faster access
// Use multiple blocks with variable block sizes for better load balancing
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same path
