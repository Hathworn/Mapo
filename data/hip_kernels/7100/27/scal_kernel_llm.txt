```
// Ensure that the kernel launch configuration effectively balances the workload across threads
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequent global memory accesses for improved performance
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations
// Fine-tune the thread block size to optimize warp occupancy and maximize the throughput
// Reuse allocated registers as much as possible by reducing code complexity inside the loop
// Minimize conditional statements inside the loop to reduce divergence and improve efficiency
