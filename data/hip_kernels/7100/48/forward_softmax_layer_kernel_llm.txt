```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes from/to input and output arrays.
// Consider splitting the loop body for numerical stability computations for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Evaluate if shared memory can be used to offload some computation from registers.
// Utilize shared memory for data reuse within the warp for better memory throughput.
// Check whether pre-fetching input data into registers can reduce latency.
