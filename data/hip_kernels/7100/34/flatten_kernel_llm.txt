// Optimize thread indexing calculation to minimize occupancy pressure
// Precompute b to reduce redundant calculations in the loop
// Optimize the index calculations using properties of modulo and division to enhance performance
// Optimize memory access pattern by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Optimize conditional operation to shorten the execution path
