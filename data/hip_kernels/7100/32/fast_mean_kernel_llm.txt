```c
// Use shared memory to accumulate results for each block
// Optimize memory access by coalescing loads from global memory
// Minimize divergence by restructuring reduction logic
// Reduce synchronization overhead by adapting warp-level reductions
// Consider loop unrolling for the accumulation loops
```
