```
// Consider using shared memory to buffer partial sums to reduce global memory access frequency
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling improves performance benefits for the two inner loops
// Assess whether reducing block size could lead to better occupancy and more efficient execution
