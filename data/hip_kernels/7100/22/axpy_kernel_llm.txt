```
// Ensure data alignment for improved memory access efficiency
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within a block is possible
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced memory access
// Minimize the use of global memory access inside the computation loop
// Evaluate using larger thread blocks to improve parallel efficiency
// Ensure grid and block sizes are optimized for the specific hardware architecture
// If possible, use higher precision arithmetic for accumulated operations
