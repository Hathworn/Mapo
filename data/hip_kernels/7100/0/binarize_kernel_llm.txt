```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve throughput
// Evaluate reducing divergent branches for improved warp execution
// Analyze the use of efficient mathematical functions for precision
// Explore further loop unrolling opportunities for performance gain
