```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory access
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for both reading from input and writing to output
// Explore the possibility of using atomic operations if applicable to avoid race conditions
// Ensure loop unrolling pragma doesn't increase register pressure and affects performance negatively
// Evaluate the thread block size for optimal utilization of the GPU resources
