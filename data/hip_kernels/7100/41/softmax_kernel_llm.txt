```
// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory for input
// Use warp-level primitives for more efficient reduction
// Minimize global memory transactions by using registers where possible
// Consider loop unrolling for the main calculation loops
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth
// Preload data to shared memory to reduce memory latency
