```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data_im for better memory access efficiency
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput
// Minimize divergent branches inside the kernel
// Ensure the memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Prefetch data into registers if it fits for frequently accessed variables
