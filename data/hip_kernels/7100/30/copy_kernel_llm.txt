```
// Use shared memory if data reusability and bank conflicts need optimization
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth
// Prefer strided access patterns to match memory access patterns of the hardware
// Consider loop unrolling for better warp utilization if N is large
// Check for alignment opportunities in X and Y for improved performance
// Reduce the number of calculations within the loop by precomputing invariant expressions
