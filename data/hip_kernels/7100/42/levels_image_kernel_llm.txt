```
// Use shared memory for storing image data to reduce global memory access.
// Use a 2D grid of blocks to improve coalesced memory access.
// Avoid redundant calculations by precomputing offsets where possible.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only image data to leverage caching.
// Optimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring memory alignment.
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing intermediate variable usage.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by optimizing conditional branches.
// Optimize memory transaction efficiency by ensuring data accesses are coalesced.
// Use half precision floats if computational precision allows to reduce memory and bandwidth usage.
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by optimizing block and grid dimensions.
