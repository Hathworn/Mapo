```c
// Consider preloading data into shared memory to further reduce global memory access.
// Merge two loops iterating over 'batch' and 'size' if possible to improve locality.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Avoid using atomic operations within loops if possible; they can be bottleneck.
// Use __syncthreads() when dealing with shared memory to ensure all threads have completed computation.
// Store rsqrtf values in temporary variables to prevent recomputation.
// Consider using float4 or float2 to load data if data alignment allows it for coalesced memory access.
// Optimize block size and grid size to ensure efficient GPU utilization.
