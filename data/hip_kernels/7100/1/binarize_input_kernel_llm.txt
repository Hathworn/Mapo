```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads and writes
// Use shared memory effectively to avoid redundant global memory accesses
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance in the binary operation
```
