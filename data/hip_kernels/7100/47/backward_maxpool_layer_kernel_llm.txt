```
// Consider prefetching data to minimize memory latency
// Avoid redundant calculations inside the loop, such as recalculating indices
// Use shared memory for data that can be reused by multiple threads
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches by simplifying control structures
