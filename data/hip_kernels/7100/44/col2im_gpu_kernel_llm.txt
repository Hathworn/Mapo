```cpp
// Precompute total threads for efficient looping
// Minimize memory accesses by caching reused computations like w_col_start, w_col_end, h_col_start, h_col_end
// Use precomputed offset and coefficients to avoid redundant calculations inside loops
// Favor a single loop structure for potential compiler optimizations and loop unrolling
// Accumulate results in a local variable to reduce global memory accesses
```
