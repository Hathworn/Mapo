// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by verifying INCX is set to 1 to facilitate efficient memory transactions.
// Consider loop unrolling for operations inside the kernel to potentially increase instruction throughput.
// Use shared memory to store repetitive read-only data if applicable, especially if ALPHA is constant across threads.
