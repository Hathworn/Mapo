```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced global memory access.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Perform reduction within the block to minimize inter-thread communication.
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() to avoid data hazards.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient reduction.
