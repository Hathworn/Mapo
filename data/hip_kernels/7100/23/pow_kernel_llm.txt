```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Prefer using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Reduce redundant calculations by storing intermediate results
// Tune block and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy
// Minimize divergence within the same warp by aligning data access patterns
// Consider vectorized loads and stores for further memory bandwidth optimization
