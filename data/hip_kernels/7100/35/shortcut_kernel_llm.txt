// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed variables like minw, minh, etc.
// Optimize the memory access by ensuring coalesced reads for out and add arrays.
// Check for potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage and address alignment.
// Implement loop unrolling on index calculations for better performance.
