```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by revisiting array indexing
// Use __restrict__ keyword to potentially help with compiler optimizations for pointer aliasing
// Prefetch memory if each filter will be used multiple times
// Ensure the memory for part[] is aligned to avoid bank conflicts
// Adjust the block size dynamically based on hardware for optimal performance
// Compiler directives can be considered for loop unrolling to ensure it is always applied
// Investigate the use of warp shuffles to replace some shared memory operations
