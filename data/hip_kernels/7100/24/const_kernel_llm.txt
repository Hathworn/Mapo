```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses using vectorized data types
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed values and reduce global memory reads
// Optimize the loop to minimize divergent branches among the threads
// Utilize warp-level primitives to enhance memory access patterns
```
