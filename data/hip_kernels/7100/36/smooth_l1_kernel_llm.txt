// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency.
// Use coalesced memory accesses to enhance global memory throughput.
// Ensure that 'n' is divisible by the block size to avoid partial block execution overhead.
// Assess potential register pressure to avoid exceeding the register limit and avoid spilling to local memory.
