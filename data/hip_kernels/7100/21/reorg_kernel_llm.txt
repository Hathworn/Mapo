```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access times
// Consider loop unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism for index calculations
// Coalesce global memory accesses by accessing consecutive memory addresses in each thread
// Minimize the number of divergent branches by optimizing conditional operations
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and decrease warp divergence
