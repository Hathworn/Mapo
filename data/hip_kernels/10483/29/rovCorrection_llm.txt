```
// Consider coalescing memory access for 'regression' to improve memory access efficiency.
// Access contiguous memory to leverage caching and reduce global memory access time.
// Align data structures and access patterns to avoid bank conflicts.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce redundant reads from global memory.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction throughput.
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize GPU occupancy and reduce warp divergence.
