```
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'controls' array to improve memory efficiency.
// Use shared memory to cache 'controls' data if it fits into shared memory size limit.
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and load balance.
// Consider reducing printf calls to minimize performance impact on GPU kernels.
// Ensure kernel launch configuration is optimized for the architecture in use.
