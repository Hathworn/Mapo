```
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'labelledImage' and 'pops' arrays.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses inside the for-loops.
// Optimize loop order to improve memory coalescing.
// Minimize divergence by restructuring conditions, especially inside loops.
// Compute cx and cy without intermediate values to optimize register usage.
// Preload frequently accessed 'labelledImage' and 'pops' values to shared memory.
// Ensure 'results' array is written to in a coalesced manner.
