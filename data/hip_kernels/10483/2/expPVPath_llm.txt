```
// Precompute powers of (1 + gr) and (1 + rrr) to optimize repeated computations
// Cache repeated calculations to reduce redundant operations
// Use ternary operations to condense conditional logic
// Consolidate multiple operations into single expressions for efficiency
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access
