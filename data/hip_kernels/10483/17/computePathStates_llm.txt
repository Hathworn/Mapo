```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure efficient use of shared memory by minimizing bank conflicts
// Coordinate thread synchronization with __syncthreads to avoid race conditions
// Optimize loop unrolling for predictable loop patterns
// Consider coalesced access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Align memory allocations to facilitate efficient memory access
