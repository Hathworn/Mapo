```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data such as xmins and xmaxes to reduce global memory access.
// Precompute expressions like powf(dimRes, noDims - ii - 1) outside the loop for efficiency.
// Evaluate if the loop for deconstructing index could be optimized or unrolled for fixed noDims values.
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern to improve bandwidth utilization by accessing regression array linearly.
// Minimize conditional operations inside the kernel by refactoring logic to reduce branching.
