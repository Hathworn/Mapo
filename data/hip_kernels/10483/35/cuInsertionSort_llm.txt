```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access.
// Consider using shared memory to store portions of dist and ind for faster access.
// Reduce bank conflicts by ensuring data access patterns are friendly to memory banks.
// Unroll inner loops to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for efficient data exchange between threads.
