```c
// Preload data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use shared memory to cache sub-matrices of A and B for faster access
// Launch sufficient threads per block to hide memory latency
// Ensure memory access coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Synchronize threads appropriately to ensure correct data usage
// Use conditionals to avoid out-of-bound memory access
// Perform computations using shared memory data to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider using half precision if precision can be traded-off for performance
// Optimize the loop unrolling factor to balance between instruction count and register pressure
