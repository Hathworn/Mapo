```
// Consider coalesced memory access for fuelCosts and uResults arrays.
// Try to optimize atomic operations, possibly by using reduction patterns.
// Investigate memory alignment and padding to ensure optimal global memory access.
// Explore use of shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access latency.
// Reduce synchronization barriers if thread-independent paths can be optimized.
