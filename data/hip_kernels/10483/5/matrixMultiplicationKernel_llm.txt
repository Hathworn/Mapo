```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by adjusting shared memory array indexing.
// Simplify conditional checks with loop unrolling for small BLOCK_SIZE values.
// Ensure global loads and stores are aligned to boost performance.
// Consider using float4 loads/stores for better memory throughput if dimensions allow.
// Analyze opportunity for prefetching data to reduce memory latency.
// Review boundary conditions to minimize unnecessary execution paths.
