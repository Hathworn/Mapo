```cpp
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed variables if possible to reduce global memory access
// Minimize the use of pow() by precomputing and storing results if they are reused
// Consider loop unrolling where noDims is known to be small to enhance performance
// Align memory access when accessing `regression` to avoid bank conflicts
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring similar execution paths within warps
// Prefetch `regCoeffs` into registers before using them in computation loops
