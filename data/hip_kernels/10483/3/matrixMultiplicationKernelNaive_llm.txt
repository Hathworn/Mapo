```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance
// Load matrix tiles into shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed loading to shared memory
// Synchronize threads again after computation to avoid data hazards
