// Use shared memory for A and B to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated computations
// Align memory accesses to increase bandwidth efficiency
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize GPU utilization
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring even division of workload
