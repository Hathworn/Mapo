```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Preload xmins and xmaxes to shared memory to reduce latency
// Use a loop unrolling strategy to optimize the for loop for calculating powers
// Minimize global memory writes by accumulating results in registers when possible
// Ensure proper memory coalescing when accessing queryPts and regression arrays
// Consider using __syncthreads() where necessary for synchronization and correctness
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations to improve memory access patterns and throughput
