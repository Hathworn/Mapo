```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize shared memory usage and bank conflicts to optimize memory performance.
// Reduce the number of calls to __syncthreads() to improve performance.
// Ensure that memory reads and writes are coalesced to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Use loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overheads where possible.
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing live variables at any given time.
// Consider the use of constant memory for speciesParams to leverage broadcast efficiency.
// Align data structures to avoid misaligned memory accesses which can reduce memory bandwidth efficiency.
