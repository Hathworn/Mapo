```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Minimize divergence by aligning loops with thread dimensions.
// Utilize atomic operations to ensure consistency across threads.
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory operations complete before subsequent steps.
// Replace atomic operations if possible to reduce contention and improve performance.
// Align memory accesses when reading from xvals to increase coalescing.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize grid-size and block-size to ensure maximum utilization of available resources.
