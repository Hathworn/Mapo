```
// Consider adjusting the block size based on the target GPU to maximize occupancy and reduce register pressure.
// Use __ldg() for reading input matrices if they are read-only to utilize texture memory for cached access.
// Utilize loop unrolling for the innermost loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to ensure continuous memory reads for improved throughput.
// Ensure shared memory accesses have no bank conflicts to optimize parallel reads and writes.
// Explore using streaming multiprocessor features like warp-shuffle operations for optimized data exchange.
// Assess the shared memory size and reduce it if possible to increase SM utilization and occupancy.
