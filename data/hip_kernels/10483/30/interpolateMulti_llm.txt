```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Reduce redundant power calculations to enhance computational efficiency.
// Compute indices for memory access outside of critical loops where possible.
// Ensure inputs are aligned for coalesced memory access.
// Optimize access patterns to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Utilize constants wherever feasible to reduce register pressure.
