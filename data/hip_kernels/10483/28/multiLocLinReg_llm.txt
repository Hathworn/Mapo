```c
// Use shared memory to store data used by multiple threads to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize the use of local arrays inside the kernel to manage limited registers efficiently.
// Merge B[ii] and A calculations into a single loop to improve memory locality and reduce overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading xvals and yvals arrays.
// Use warp-level primitives for efficient sharing of data within a warp.
// Remove unnecessary calls to pow() as it can be costly and calculated before the kernel launch.
// Consider using a tile-based approach for reducing the complexity of indirection in global memory access.
// Prefetch data into registers or shared memory for anticipated access to hide latency.
