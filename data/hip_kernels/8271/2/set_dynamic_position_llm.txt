```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access for arr
// Optimize shared memory size for better occupancy
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Ensure sufficient threads per block for optimal utilization
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Use constant memory if t is constant across threads
