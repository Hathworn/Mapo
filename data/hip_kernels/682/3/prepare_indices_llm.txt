// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointer arguments to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure data array is allocated in pinned memory to enhance memory transfer rates
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within the block to reduce global memory access
// Utilize coalesced memory access patterns to optimize bandwidth usage
