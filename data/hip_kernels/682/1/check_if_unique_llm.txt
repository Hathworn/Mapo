```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Employ warp-level primitives to minimize branch divergence
// Align 'keys' and 'is_unique' arrays to 128 bytes if possible for efficient memory transactions
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy and resource utilization
