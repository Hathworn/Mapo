// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads in the same warp access consecutive memory locations
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing repeated values in local variables or registers
// Fine-tune block and grid sizes to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient execution
