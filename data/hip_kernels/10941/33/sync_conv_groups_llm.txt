```
// Consider using __shared__ memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize for coalesced memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance kernel performance.
// Use vectorized loads and stores to increase memory throughput.
// Ensure sufficient occupancy to maximize parallelism and throughput.
