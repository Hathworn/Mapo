```
// Consider using shared memory for block-level caching to minimize global memory accesses.
// Optimize coalesced memory access by adjusting the width step size to a multiple of the warp size.
// Reduce divergent branches by using predication or warp-level primitives.
// Take advantage of loop unrolling for known iteration counts to improve performance.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning pointers with warp boundaries.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations, if applicable, for better memory bandwidth efficiency.
