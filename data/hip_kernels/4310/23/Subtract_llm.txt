// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure aligned memory reads.
// Assess whether using texture memory could provide benefits for read-only data.
// Evaluate the benefits of using half-precision floating point operations where applicable.
// Investigate the use of memory coalescing techniques for efficient memory transactions.
