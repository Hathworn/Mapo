```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like g_Data1, g_Data2, and g_Data3 to reduce global memory reads
// Avoid repeated access to the same memory locations by caching values in registers if possible
// Investigate the usage of __ldg() to take advantage of texture cache for read-only data
// Use loop unrolling for operations involving small, fixed-number matrices or vectors
// Ensure memory coalescing by checking alignment and partition of d_Sift and other arrays
// Consider fusing kernels if there are dependent kernels executed sequentially to reduce kernel launch overhead
