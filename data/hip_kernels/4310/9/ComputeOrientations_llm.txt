```
// Consider improving memory coalescing to access g_Data
// Try to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Pre-compute fixed expressions to reduce computational overhead
// Evaluate if the data loading can be more efficiently organized
// Explore possible loop unrolling techniques for optimization
// Assess whether alternative thread block sizes might improve performance
// Investigate whether occupancy can be increased by adjusting register usage
// Review the possibility of using texture memory for g_Data if it improves access patterns
