```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure Gaussian weights are precomputed and stored in shared memory for efficient reuse.
// Minimize the boundary checks in the main computation loop.
// Utilize shared memory to store local data and intermediate histogram results.
// Apply loop unrolling in the reduction step to improve performance.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize histogram reductions.
// Ensure bank conflicts are minimized when accessing shared memory.
// Use early exits when possible to reduce unnecessary computations.
