```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Combine conditional checks for efficient access
// Utilize fminf and fmaxf for optimized floating-point operations
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning conditions
// Prefetch data into shared memory to enhance memory coalescing
// Use constant value for loop limit to reduce overhead
// Reduce warp threads when accessing memory to handle boundary conditions
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before using shared data
// Pipeline memory fetch and computation to balance workload
// Ensure blockIdx.y-based write starts for optimal memory indexing
```
