```
// Consider increasing the block size to improve occupancy and parallelization.
// Utilize coalesced access to global memory to increase memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to cache values and reduce redundant global memory reads.
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() where possible to reduce synchronization overhead.
