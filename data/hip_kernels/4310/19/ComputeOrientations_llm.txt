```
// Consider using loop unrolling for small fixed-size loops for efficiency.
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce divergent accesses within warps.
// Prefetch shared memory loads to minimize access contention.
// Align data structures to improve coalesced accesses.
// Use local variables for invariant computations within kernels.
// Consider vectorized operations to reduce the number of instructions.
