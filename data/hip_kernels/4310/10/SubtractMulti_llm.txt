```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures to be accessed by consecutive threads.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for improved bandwidth.
// Minimize conditional checks in the kernel to reduce divergence and ensure warp efficiency.
// Evaluate thread block dimensions for optimal occupancy and resource utilization.
// Analyze if texture memory can be beneficial for read-only data accesses.
