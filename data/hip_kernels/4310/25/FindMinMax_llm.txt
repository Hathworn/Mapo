// Consider using texture memory for repeated global memory access to d_Data
// Increase warp size utilization for better computational throughput
// Coalesce global memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth
// Minimize shared memory usage by using registers where possible
// Optimize reduction by using warp shuffle operations instead of __syncthreads
