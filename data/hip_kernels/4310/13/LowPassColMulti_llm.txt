```cpp
// Consider increasing the block size for better parallel efficiency.
// Optimize shared memory utilization to fit data better if possible.
// Ensure global memory access is coalesced to improve performance.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers to aid compiler optimizations.
// Tweak block and grid dimensions to optimize memory access patterns.
// Analyze if loop unrolling would enhance computational performance.
// Evaluate using texture memory to leverage 2D spatial locality.
// Conduct a memory alignment check to avoid potential misalignment penalties.
// Measure performance impact of varying CONVCOL_W and CONVCOL_H sizes.
