```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Preload data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure shared memory accesses avoid bank conflicts to optimize shared memory performance.
// Use registers as much as possible for frequently accessed variables.
// Try to minimize the size of shared memory to allow more threads to run concurrently.
// Investigate loop unrolling techniques for improved computational efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of constant memory for frequently accessed constants.
