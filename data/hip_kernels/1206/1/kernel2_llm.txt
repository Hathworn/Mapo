// Consider using memory coalescing techniques
// Ensure threads within a warp access contiguous memory addresses
// Examine shared memory usage to minimize global memory reads
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for certain access patterns
// Check alignment and padding to avoid memory bank conflicts
