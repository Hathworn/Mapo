```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring continuous threads access continuous memory elements
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible within a block
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning data structures to cache line boundaries
// Utilize asynchronous memory operations to overlap computation with memory transfers
