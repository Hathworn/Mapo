```cpp
// Optimize memory access by coalescing loads and stores, ensuring proper alignment
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads in a block access nearby memory locations
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring threads in a warp take the same execution path
// Prefetch data to reduce latency when accessing global memory
```
