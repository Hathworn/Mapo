```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for efficient data transfer
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access if applicable
// Consider loading data into registers to optimize memory latency
// Ensure that the work is evenly distributed across threads and blocks
// Investigate if loop unrolling can increase throughput
