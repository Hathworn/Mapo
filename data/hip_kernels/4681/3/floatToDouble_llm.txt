// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory to improve performance
// Optimize load/store operations to/from shared memory for coalesced access
// Adjust block size to maximize shared memory utilization
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used effectively to prevent data hazards
