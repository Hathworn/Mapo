```c
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Consider minimizing use of atomic operations, if any, to reduce contention
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure data alignment to avoid accessing unaligned memory
// Optimize loop unrolling for any potential performance benefits
// Consider using local memory to hold intermediate computation results
// Ensure each thread block has enough threads to fully utilize SHARED memory
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Preload any constant data to reduce unnecessary memory fetches
