```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for B by ensuring coalesced reads and writes.
// Explore using shared memory for frequently accessed data like lamBeta to reduce global memory accesses.
// Investigate the impact of using __ldg() intrinsic for reading external and lamBeta to potentially leverage texture cache.
// Ensure hiprand_init does not introduce performance bottlenecks; pre-initializing states in a setup kernel could be beneficial.
// Evaluate usage of constant memory for lamBeta if it fits within the mid-term storage constraints.
