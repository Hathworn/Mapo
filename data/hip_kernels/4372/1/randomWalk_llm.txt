// Precompute sqrt(T/N) to minimize repetitive calculations and enhance memory access efficiency
// Initialize random state with enhanced seeding for better random number quality and independent streams
// Use a single hiprand call within the loop to reduce overhead and improve performance
// Ensure aligned memory access patterns to optimize memory throughput
// Minimize condition checks inside the loop to reduce branching and improve pipeline efficiency
