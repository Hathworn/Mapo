```
// Use shared memory if multiple threads require access to common data to reduce global memory access
// Consider memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency
// Utilize __syncthreads() judiciously to ensure proper synchronization where necessary
// Investigate warp shuffle operations to benefit from lower latency for intrawarp communication
