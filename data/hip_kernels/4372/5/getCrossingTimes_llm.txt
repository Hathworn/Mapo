```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to results and crossTimes arrays
// Utilize shared memory if possible to further optimize access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling with multiple iterations per loop for faster execution
// Investigate warp synchronization to reduce branching divergence
// Use atomic operations if possible to avoid race conditions in crossTimes update
