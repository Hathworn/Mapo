```c
// Use shared memory to cache data frequently accessed by threads to improve memory access times.
// Consider using memory coalescing for accessing results and crossTimes arrays to improve global memory bandwidth.
// Initialize hiprandState with different seeds for each thread to ensure randomness and avoid correlations.
// Use warp shuffle functions to reduce thread divergence when checking boundary conditions.
// Allocate results and crossTimes arrays in the GPU's global memory with optimal alignment to improve access speed.
