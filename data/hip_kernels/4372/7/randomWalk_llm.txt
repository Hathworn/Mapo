```
// Use shared memory to cache results if they will be accessed multiple times
// Minimize state reinitialization by reusing state within the same thread
// Coalesce memory accesses to maximize memory throughput
// Unroll loops when the number of iterations is known at compile time
// Consider using double buffer strategy to overlap computation and memory transfer
```
