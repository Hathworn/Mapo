```
// Consider aligning data access to improve memory coalescing
// Ensure hiprandState_t is efficiently used to minimize overhead
// Investigate if shared memory usage could reduce global memory bandwidth
// Check if loop unrolling factor is optimal for GPU architecture
// Optimize memory access patterns in the loop to reduce latency
