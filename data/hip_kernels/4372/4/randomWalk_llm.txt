// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for 'results' array
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Implement loop unrolling for better instruction throughput
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency
// Evaluate usage of warp-level primitives for better parallel reduction
