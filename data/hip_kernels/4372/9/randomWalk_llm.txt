// Consider using shared memory to cache commonly accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution to improve performance.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of loop unrolling for the 'for' loop inside the kernel.
// Optimize the use of hiprand_normal_double by exploring alternatives like generating multiple random numbers in bulk.
