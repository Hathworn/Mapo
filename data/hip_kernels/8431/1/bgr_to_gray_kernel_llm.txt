```
// Use shared memory to load a tile of the input image for better memory access patterns.
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Align input and output memory to reduce address calculations inside the kernel.
// Ensure 128-bit reads and writes by using data types like uchar4 for better memory bandwidth utilization.
