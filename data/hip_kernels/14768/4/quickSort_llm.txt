```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory fetching.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring the condition checks.
// Use shared memory for temporary variables 'temp', 'pivot', 'i', and 'j' to optimize memory usage.
// Reduce repeated global memory accesses by using registers for frequently accessed variables.
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory performance.
