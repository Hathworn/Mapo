```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Load lifter coefficients into shared memory in a coalesced manner
// Ensure synchronization after writing into shared memory
// Optimize lifter coefficient application by unrolling the loop, if possible
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
