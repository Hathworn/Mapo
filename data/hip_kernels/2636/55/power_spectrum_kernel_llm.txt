```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access.
// Employ loop unrolling for further reduction in loop overhead.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for efficient data exchange.
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts and improve coalescing.
// Reorder arithmetic operations to maximize instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize usage of __syncthreads() to prevent unnecessary synchronization overhead.
