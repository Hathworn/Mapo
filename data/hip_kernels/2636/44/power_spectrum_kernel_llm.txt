```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations for Ar and Aw.
// Use shared memory to store Ar values within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize conditional statements inside the loop to improve warp efficiency.
// If possible, prefetch data to registers before processing to hide global memory latency.
// Align data structures if applicable to enable more efficient memory transactions.
