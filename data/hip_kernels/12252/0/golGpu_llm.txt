```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for neighbor cells.
// Coalesce global memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches in if-else conditions.
// Implement loop unrolling for the live neighbors calculation.
// Align data structures to cache line size to optimize memory reads/writes.
