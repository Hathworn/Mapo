```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations for d_disparity_compact.
// Use shared memory to cache data from global memory when possible to minimize global memory accesses.
// Utilize __ldg() to load data from global memory when applicable to take advantage of read-only cache.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that conditions in the if-statement are consistent across threads within a warp.
// Where applicable, opt for intrinsic functions like __fdividef() for faster operations.
// Evaluate whether reducing multiple independent accumulations into a single operation can optimize the code.
// Store intermediate results in registers to reduce redundant calculations.
// Ensure the optimal occupancy by controlling the amount of shared memory and number of registers per thread.
// Reorganize operations to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Balance the workload between threads to ensure each thread does an equal amount of work.
