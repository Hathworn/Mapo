```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data, reducing global memory access latency.
// Prefetch data from global memory to shared memory for coalesced access.
// Optimize memory access patterns for better coalescing and minimizing divergence.
// Investigate potential use of textures for read operations to exploit caching mechanisms.
// Consider optimizing pitch alignment for better access patterns and avoiding bank conflicts.
