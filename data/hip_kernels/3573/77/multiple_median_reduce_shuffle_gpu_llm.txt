```
// Optimize: Consider coalesced memory access by aligning reads to d_in
// Optimize: Reduce divergent execution paths in load stage
// Optimize: Increase shared memory utilization by increasing tile size
// Optimize: Consider loop unrolling in load stage for pipeline efficiency
// Optimize: Leverage warp shuffles instead of shared memory when applicable
// Optimize: Ensure __syncthreads() does not cause unnecessary stalls
// Optimize: Optimize register usage to allow higher occupancy
