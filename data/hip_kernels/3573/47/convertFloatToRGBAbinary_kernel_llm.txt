```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used values
// Consider using `__restrict__` keyword for pointers to indicate no aliasing
// Align data memory accesses to improve coalescing efficiency
// Optimize thread block size for specific GPU architecture to improve occupancy
// Utilize asynchronous data transfer to overlap communication with computation
