```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads access contiguous memory addresses
// Check occupancy and adjust block size if necessary to maximize resource usage
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
