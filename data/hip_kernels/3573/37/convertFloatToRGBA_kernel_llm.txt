```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for the condition checks to improve performance
// Avoid type casting inside the kernel, compute outside if possible
// Prefer warp-wise memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Check for bank conflicts when using shared memory and optimize accordingly
// Minimize divergence by structuring conditional statements efficiently
// Evaluate if prefetching data can further optimize memory accesses
