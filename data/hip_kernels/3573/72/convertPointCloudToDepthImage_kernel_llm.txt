// Consider coalescing memory accesses to point_cloud to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize transformation calculations by using shared memory if possible to cache R and T matrices for reuse among threads.
// Suggest using __ldg for constant memory access to R and T matrices to improve read efficiency.
// Check for opportunities to minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Ensure depth_image is allocated to avoid bank conflicts and optimize atomic operations.
