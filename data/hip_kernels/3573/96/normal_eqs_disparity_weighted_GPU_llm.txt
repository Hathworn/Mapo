```
// Optimize memory access patterns by reducing latency through coalesced access.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access times.
// Reuse Zbuffer, discrepancy, and normals data, stored in registers, during computations.
// Ensure multiple threads access contiguous memory to improve coalesced performance.
// Investigate using memory prefetching techniques for frequent accessed data.
// Balance computation and memory operations to hide memory latency.
// Evaluate shared memory occupancy regarding the number of threads per block.
