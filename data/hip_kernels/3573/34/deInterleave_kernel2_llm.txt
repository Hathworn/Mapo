// Avoid unaligned memory accesses by using float2 pointers for d_XY_in
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time
// Optimize pitch calculations to minimize integer arithmetic overhead
// Consider using loop unrolling for the pixel processing if the loop is large enough
