```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads to match data layout in memory
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth if data reuse occurs
// Align pitch parameter to the memory access pattern for better performance
// Use __ldg() for read-only data if memory is read multiple times to utilize texture cache
// Minimize divergent branches to keep warp execution efficient
