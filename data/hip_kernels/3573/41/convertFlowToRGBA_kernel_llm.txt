```c
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by adjusting data structures if necessary.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize performance for operations like sqrtf.
// Check if lowerLim and upperLim can be loaded once into shared memory to save repeated loads.
