```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring that the data reads from d_C are contiguous
// Prefer shared memory over global memory to reduce latency
// Use warp shuffle operations to optimize reduction within each warp
// Minimize memory access by reducing data dependencies and calculations within the loop
// Ensure __syncthreads only where necessary to prevent data hazards
