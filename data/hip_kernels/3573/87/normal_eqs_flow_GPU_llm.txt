```cpp
// Use shared memory to store A-matrix temporarily to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalesced global memory accesses for d_flow_compact, d_Zbuffer_flow_compact, and d_ind_flow_Zbuffer.
// Minimize divergent branches to improve performance.
// Use __ldg() to load read-only data from global memory for better caching.
// Consider merging small kernels to reduce kernel launch overheads.
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize memory latency.
