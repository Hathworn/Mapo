```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Load disparity and disparity_prior into shared memory at the beginning to minimize latency
// Ensure threads synchronize after loading data into shared memory for consistency
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for output image to improve throughput
// Evaluate potential optimization by using texture memory for disparity access
// Assess loop unrolling for arithmetic operations to enhance processing speed
// Minimize conditional branching and divergence for warp efficiency
