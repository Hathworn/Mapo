```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store nearby flow values for reduced global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by improving data layout, such as structuring data in SoA (Structure of Arrays) form.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy and minimize divergence.
// Use __ldg() for reading read-only global memory data to utilize texture caching, if applicable.
// Evaluate the use of constant memory for cons_thres if it remains unchanged across kernel calls.
