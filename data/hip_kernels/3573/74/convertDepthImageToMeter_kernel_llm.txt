// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for data that is repeatedly accessed.
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing by ensuring that thread accesses are contiguous.
// Investigate warp-level optimization techniques to improve performance on accessing global memory.
// Implement loop unrolling if possible to decrease instruction overhead within the kernel.
// Examine potential benefits of using texture memory for read-only data like d_depth_image_millimeter.
