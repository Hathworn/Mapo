```
// Consider using shared memory to store d_ind and d_label if reused multiple times within the block
// Minimize global memory accesses by using local variables for repeated data
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations across threads
// Reduce instruction count by avoiding unnecessary computations
// Use integer arithmetic to reduce arithmetic latency
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and memory bandwidth utilization
