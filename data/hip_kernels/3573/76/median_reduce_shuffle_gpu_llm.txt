```
// Consider coalesced memory access by adjusting sample indices for optimal performance.
// Prefetch data to shared memory in chunks to minimize global memory access latency.
// Use loop unrolling if the loop's trip count is known at compile time to reduce control overhead.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting data storage layout.
// Utilize warp shuffle instructions to replace some synchronization barriers with warp-level operations.
