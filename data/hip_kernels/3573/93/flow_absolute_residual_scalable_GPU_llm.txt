```
// Consider coalesced access patterns by reordering data structures to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data elements to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Optimize data fetching by minimizing the number of fetches and maximizing the use of cached data.
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous copy to reduce the memory transfer overhead.
// Assess occupancy to ensure that the kernel launches enough threads to maximize GPU resource utilization.
// Investigate further unrolling of loops or processing multiple elements per thread to enhance performance.
