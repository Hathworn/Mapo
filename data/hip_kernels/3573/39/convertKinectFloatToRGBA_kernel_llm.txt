```
// Consider coalesced memory access for out_image
// Consider using shared memory to cache in_image data
// Pre-compute common expressions like (upperLim - lowerLim)
// Replace branching in color calculation with lookup tables if feasible
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler with optimizations
