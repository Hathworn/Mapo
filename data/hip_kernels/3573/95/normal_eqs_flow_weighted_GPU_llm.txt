```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads
// Consider using float4 for fetching data to minimize memory transactions
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure shared memory operations are synchronized
// Leverage atomic operations wisely to avoid serialization of threads
// Align data structures to facilitate coalesced access patterns
