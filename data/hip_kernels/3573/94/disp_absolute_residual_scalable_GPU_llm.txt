```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Load transformation matrix into shared memory
// Only process valid indices
// Fetch disparity, Zbuffer, and normal from global memory
// Compute coordinates
// Reconstruct 3D point from disparity
// Arbitrary use of fx for now
// Reconstruct 3D point from model
// Compute absolute residual (weighted by disparity vs flow importance)
