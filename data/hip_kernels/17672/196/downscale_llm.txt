```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data if it's reused multiple times within the same block
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning global memory read and write access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and possibly increase ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointers if possible to aid compiler optimizations by indicating there are no aliasing issues
```
