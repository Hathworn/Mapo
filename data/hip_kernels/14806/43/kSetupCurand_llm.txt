```cpp
// Use __restrict__ qualifier if applicable to indicate no aliasing
// Ensure memory alignment for state array to enable coalesced accesses
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within the kernel
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy based on hardware specifics
