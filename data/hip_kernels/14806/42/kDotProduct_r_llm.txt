```
// Consider using aligned memory accesses for improved memory coalescing.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve compiler optimizations.
// Experiment with different block sizes to potentially improve occupancy.
// Investigate the impact of employing warp shuffle operations in the reduction phase.
// Ensure all memory transactions are aligned to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Review unrolling factors for the loop to match specific architecture's capabilities.
// Assess the impact of additional caching mechanisms like read-only caches.
