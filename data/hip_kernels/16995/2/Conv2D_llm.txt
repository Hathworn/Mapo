```
// Consider reducing shared memory size if possible to optimize memory usage.
// Loading data into shared memory can benefit from memory coalescing.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization by analyzing data dependencies.
// Optimizing kernel size condition checks may improve performance.
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed kernel data.
// Consider loop unrolling in convolution operation for better performance.
// Minimize conditional branches to reduce warp divergence.
