```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase memory throughput.
// Optimize loop unrolling to minimize loop control overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Review thread block and grid dimensions to ensure optimal occupancy and efficient resource utilization.
