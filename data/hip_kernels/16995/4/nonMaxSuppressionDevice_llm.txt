```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce memory access time for gradient arrays.
// Evaluate using texture memory for d_gradientMag for better cache utilization.
// Align memory access to optimize memory transactions and reduce bank conflicts.
// Use loop unwinding techniques to minimize control flow divergence in thread execution.
// Explore coalesced memory access patterns to enhance global memory throughput.
// Investigate using half-precision floats for computations where precision is less critical.
