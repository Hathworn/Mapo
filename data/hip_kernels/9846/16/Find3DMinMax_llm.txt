```cpp
// Make use of shared memory to cache data for better memory access patterns.
// Ensure memory coalescing when loading and storing data from/to global memory.
// Use fminf and fmaxf for fast floating-point min/max calculations.
// Avoid warp divergence by synchronizing threads appropriately.
// Pre-compute indices to minimize runtime calculations.
// Clamp xEnd to avoid out-of-bounds memory accesses.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize shared memory usage among threads.
// Consider loop unrolling for the loop with a fixed size to improve performance.
