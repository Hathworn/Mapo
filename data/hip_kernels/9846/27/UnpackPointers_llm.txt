```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache minmax data and reduce global memory latency
// Ensure synchronization after loading data into shared memory
// Minimize conditional checks by combining conditions
// Reduce bank conflicts by adjusting access patterns to ptrs
// Synchronize again to ensure consistent processing across threads
```
