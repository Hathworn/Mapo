```
// Use shared memory to load tiles of data for better memory coalescing
// Consider vectorized memory accesses for improved throughput
// Evaluate the benefits of using texture memory for read-only inputs
// Fuse multiple operations if applicable to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance
