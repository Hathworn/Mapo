// Consider using warp shuffle operations for more efficient reduction instead of __syncthreads().
// Utilize more shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Explore coalesced memory access patterns for g_Data loads to improve bandwidth usage.
// Use texture or read-only cache for g_Data if access patterns are suitable for caching.
