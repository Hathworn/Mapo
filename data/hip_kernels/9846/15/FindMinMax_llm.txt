```
// Consider using float4 data type to leverage coalesced memory access
// Preload data into shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() is minimized but correctly placed
// Consider doubling block size for higher occupancy if resource usage allows
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring appropriate shared memory access patterns
