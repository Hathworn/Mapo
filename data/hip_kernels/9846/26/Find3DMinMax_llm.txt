```
// Consider padding shared memory arrays to avoid bank conflicts.
// Align shared memory access to warp boundaries to improve performance.
// Utilize coalesced global memory access by aligning data to the warp size.
// Avoid divergent branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Reduce shared memory usage where possible to increase occupancy.
// Load data into shared memory in a coalesced manner to improve memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate if shared memory double buffering can be used for overlapping computation with memory transfers.
