// Optimize memory access by preloading global memory values into registers.
// Use intrinsic function __fdividef instead of regular division for better performance.
// Simplify thread index calculation for efficient parallel execution.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to maximize throughput.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Clamp position offsets to avoid out-of-bounds accesses and ensure numerical stability.
// Utilize the texture cache for read-only memory operations, if applicable.
