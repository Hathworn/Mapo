```
// Consider optimizing shared memory usage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use memory coalescing techniques to access global memory in a more efficient manner.
// Re-use loaded data in registers to minimize repeated fetching from global memory.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to enhance coalescing and reduce transaction overhead.
// Minimize branch divergence within the warp by ensuring all threads follow similar execution paths.
