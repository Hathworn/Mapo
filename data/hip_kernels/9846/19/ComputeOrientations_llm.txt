```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when reading g_Data for better performance
// Loop unrolling can be used to load shared memory more efficiently
// Ensure sufficient shared memory resources to prevent bank conflicts
// Minimize the use of atomic operations where possible to improve performance
// Explore register usage optimization to improve throughput
// Opt for warp-level operations over block-wide synchronization when applicable
