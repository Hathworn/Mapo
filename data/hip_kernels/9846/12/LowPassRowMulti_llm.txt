```
// Consider using compile-time constants for width and pitch to enable more compiler optimizations.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing the size of the shared memory buffer "data" to reduce memory consumption.
// Ensure proper alignment of memory accesses by adjusting the load position calculation.
// Use loop unrolling or mathematical transformations for further optimization within the computation loop.
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data "d_Data" to improve memory access speed and reduce latency.
