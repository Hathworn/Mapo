// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning column reads to warp size
// Minimize conditional statements in the memory loop for better warp execution
// Preload kernel values into registers for faster access
// Use local variables to minimize shared memory reads and improve thread-level performance
// Add loop unrolling where applicable to enhance computational efficiency
