// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider using coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Load d_ConstantA and d_ConstantB into registers to reduce latency
// Check whether loop unrolling would provide performance benefits
// Evaluate if prefetching d_Data can minimize cache misses
