// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Minimize bank conflicts by adjusting shared memory access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed global memory data.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reusing previously loaded data when possible.
// Apply loop unrolling to improve loop execution efficiency.
// Reduce unnecessary synchronizations to improve kernel execution time.
