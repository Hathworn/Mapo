```
// Use more efficient memory accesses by coalescing reads from global memory.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the reduction phase to minimize branch divergence.
// Ensure that the shared memory usage is optimized to prevent bank conflicts.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations to speed up memory transactions.
// Explore the possibility of using atomic operations for final min-max calculation if contention is low.
// Profile the code to tune the block size and grid size for maximum performance.
