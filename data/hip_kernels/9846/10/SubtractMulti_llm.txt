// Use shared memory to reduce redundant accesses to global memory  
// Ensure data access patterns are coalesced  
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction throughput  
// Optimize memory access by using faster memory (e.g., vectorized loads/stores)  
// Ensure global memory access is aligned  
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data access  
// Minimize divergent branching to improve warp efficiency
