```
// Consider using memory coalescing for accessing Y, dY, and dX arrays to improve memory access efficiency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts during reduction operations.
// Ensure that the dimension 'dim' is a multiple of SOFTMAX_NUM_THREADS to fully utilize threads and avoid divergence.
// Evaluate if reducing synchronization points (__syncthreads) can be achieved without affecting correctness.
