```
// Consider memory alignment for better load/store efficiency
// Investigate using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that the data is coalesced for better global memory throughput
// Check if prefetching global memory to HW private memory is beneficial
// Assess whether adjusting memory access patterns could reduce bank conflicts
// Use asynchronous memory operations to hide memory latency if applicable
