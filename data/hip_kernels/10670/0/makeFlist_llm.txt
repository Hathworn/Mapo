```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Initialize shared memory in parallel by distributing work across threads.
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory is fully initialized before use.
// Use atomic operations carefully to avoid memory contention.
// Synchronize threads again before writing accumulated results to global memory.
// Write back to global memory after accumulation to reduce global memory writes.
