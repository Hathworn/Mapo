```
// Consider maximizing memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible
// Ensure memory access is aligned for efficiency, particularly for u, v, and src arrays
// Strive to minimize the use of __global__ memory accesses in favor of registers or shared memory
// Leverage texture memory for input data with uniform access patterns to improve throughput
// Optimize the precision of floating-point arithmetic to balance performance and accuracy
// Explore the use of warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization overhead
// Unroll loops to improve instruction-level parallelism and enhance performance
