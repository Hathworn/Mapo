```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to increase memory throughput.
// Optimize thread block size to improve occupancy and maximize use of available resources.
// Consider using warp-centric programming techniques for better utilization of GPU cores.
// Ensure data alignment to take advantage of memory coalescing capabilities.
