```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access
// Consider using __ldg() for reading *len and *width if accessed frequently
// Increase grid and block size to maximize GPU utilization
// Reduce bank conflicts by using padding for shared memory
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction within the block
// Consider allocating shared memory dynamically for varying block sizes
