// Consider using float4 vector types for loading and computation to improve memory coalescing
// Unroll the inner loop to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Use warp intrinsics to perform reduction within the warp to minimize shared memory usage
// Evaluate if prefetching data can further reduce memory latency
// Assess padding shared memory to prevent bank conflicts
