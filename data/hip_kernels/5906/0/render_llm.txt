```
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory alignment of framebuffer to optimize coalesced memory accesses.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and memory access patterns.
// Use texture or surface memory for framebuffer if read/write operations are frequent.
// Consider caching frequently accessed data using registers.
