```cpp
// Consider memory coalescing for global memory access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure shared memory bank conflicts are minimized
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to reduce idle warps
// Evaluate if loop unrolling provides benefit in your specific case
// Leverage memory access patterns to maximize L1 cache usage
