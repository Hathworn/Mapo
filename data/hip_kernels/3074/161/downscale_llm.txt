```
// Consider coalesced access to gradInput_data and gradOutput_data for improved memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store gradOutput_data values accessed by multiple threads to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Ensure all accesses to gradInput_data and gradOutput_data are aligned where possible for performance benefits.
// Minimize register pressure by evaluating if some local variables can be reused or eliminated.
// Assess whether loop unrolling could be beneficial for the loop to potentially expose more parallelism.
// Analyze workload balance among threads to prevent idle threads especially when no_elements is not a multiple of block size.
