```c
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring warp-synchronous operations
// Use efficient reduction technique with strided index reduction
// Ensure proper use of shared memory barriers with __syncthreads()
```
