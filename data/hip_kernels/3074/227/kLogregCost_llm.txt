```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when reading probs and maxProbs.
// Use shared memory if possible to store probs to reduce global memory accesses.
// Check if loop unrolling can improve performance in the inner loop over numOut.
// Ensure all memory writes are coalesced to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Use atomic operations if multiple threads write to the same memory location.
