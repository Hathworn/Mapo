```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by properly aligning shared memory arrays
// Consider using local memory for thread-specific data instead of shared memory if possible
// Optimize the use of `__syncthreads()` to avoid unnecessary synchronization points
// Use registers effectively to reduce global memory access latency
// Avoid divergent branches by aligning conditions within warp execution
// Consider tiling strategies for loading data into shared memory to improve memory access efficiency
