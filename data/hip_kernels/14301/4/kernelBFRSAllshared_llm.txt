```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for g_uquery and g_vpointset to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider using float4 for vectorized memory loads.
// Reduce thread divergence by minimizing conditional statements.
// Ensure that shared memory access is well-coalesced.
// Reuse loaded data in registers whenever possible to reduce redundant memory access.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
