```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for g_uquery and g_vpoint to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to store commonly accessed data in maxMetricPoints to reduce global memory latency.
// Optimize the loop in maxMetricPoints by unrolling for better performance.
// Ensure memory alignment when accessing g_uquery and g_vpoint to enhance read efficiency.
// Load the whole trial of g_vpointset into shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by aggregating results in shared memory before a single atomic update.
// Ensure that the shared memory usage does not exceed the hardware limit per block to avoid occupancy degradation.
