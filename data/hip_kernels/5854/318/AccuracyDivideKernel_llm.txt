```cpp
// Consider using shared memory if multiple values of accuracy need aggregation
// Optimize memory access by ensuring 'accuracy' pointer is aligned
// Investigate using warp-level primitives for faster computation
// Ensure N is a compile-time constant for potential additional optimizations
```
