// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring memory accesses are properly aligned
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing continuous memory in inner loops
// Use shared memory wisely to cache frequently accessed data
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
// Use __restrict__ pointers to inform the compiler about non-aliasing data
// Consider using atomic operations if data race conditions exist
// Consider splitting loops to improve parallelism and reduce thread divergence
