```
// Combine memory operations to minimize global memory access
// Use shared memory to hold intermediate calculations and reduce global memory bandwidth
// Utilize vectorized memory accesses when loading/storing float2 structures
// Consider using __ldg for read-only data to cache in texture memory
// Ensure float4 alignment if extending to float4 for coalesced access
// minimize divergent branching by removing potential branch instructions
