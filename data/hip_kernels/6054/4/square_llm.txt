// Consider using warp shuffle operations to enhance memory bandwidth
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can provide better performance for small arrays
// Optimize shared memory usage by adjusting dynamic shared memory allocation
// Consider persistent threads approach to maximize GPU utilization for large arrays
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve compiler optimizations
// Align data structures to improve coalesced memory access patterns
