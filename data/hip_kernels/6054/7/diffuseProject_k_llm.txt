// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Consider pre-loading data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from cached accesses.
// Ensure that data is aligned to achieve coalesced memory access.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize control overhead and improve instruction throughput.
// Minimize the number of redundant arithmetic operations by reusing computed values.
