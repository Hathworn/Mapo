```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous data
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize global memory reads within the loop
// Check if using a different memory space like constant memory could reduce latency
