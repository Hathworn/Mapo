```
// Consider coalesced memory access for points and out arrays to improve memory efficiency
// Use shared memory to store points data as it is accessed frequently by multiple threads
// Prefetch data into shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure idx array is read in a coalesced manner to optimize read operations
// Explore using loop unrolling techniques in the inner loop to increase throughput
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to the 32-byte boundaries for optimal performance
