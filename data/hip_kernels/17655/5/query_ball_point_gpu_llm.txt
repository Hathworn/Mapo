```
// Use shared memory to cache xyz2 to reduce global memory access latency
// Process multiple points per thread to reduce the number of kernel invocations
// Consider unrolling loops to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Check memory alignment for coalesced access patterns
// Evaluate using texture memory for frequent read-only access to xyz1 or xyz2
// Consider using atomic operations if writes to idx or pts_cnt need serialization
