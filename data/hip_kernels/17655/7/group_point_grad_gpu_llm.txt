```
// Consider using Shared Memory to optimize repeated global memory access for idx
// Optimize memory access patterns to enhance coalescing, particularly for grad_out
// Assess the benefits of using Warp-Level Primitives for further optimization
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized or optimized, as they can be a bottleneck
// Investigate the potential for loop unrolling beyond the current level for grad_points update
