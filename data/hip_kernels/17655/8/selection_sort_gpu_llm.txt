// Optimize data copy to use shared memory
// Use shared memory for faster access compared to global memory
// Reduce global memory transactions by copying data to shared memory
// Optimize selection sort with fewer swap operations
// Swap only if the index of the minimum element has changed
// Use shared memory to minimize the latency of data retrieval
// Copy shared memory back to global memory
// Minimize data transfer between shared and global memory to reduce overhead
