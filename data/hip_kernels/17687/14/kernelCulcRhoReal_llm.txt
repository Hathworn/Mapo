// Precompute qi squared to minimize redundant calculations
// Precompute qi to the fourth power to avoid repeated computation
// Use qi4 and qi2 for calculating sixth power to reduce operations
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Consider shared memory for storing intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data structures to cache line size for improved memory throughput
