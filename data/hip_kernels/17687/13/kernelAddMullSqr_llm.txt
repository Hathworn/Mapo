```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory bandwidth efficiency
// Adjust the shared memory size based on occupancy and block configuration for better performance
// Ensure shared memory access patterns avoid bank conflicts for faster access
// Use atomic operations carefully to prevent serialization and improve parallel efficiency
// Investigate the potential for loop unrolling in the reduction phase to reduce overhead
