```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory loads for kSqr to improve memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to store kSqr values if reused, to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for best performance
// Prefetch kSqr[i] into a register before use to improve memory access efficiency
