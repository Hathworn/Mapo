```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider adjusting block size for better occupancy based on specific GPU architecture.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure proper alignment of data in memory to maximize throughput.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access to enhance performance.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same instruction.
// Consider using half-warp unrolling for improved performance on certain architectures.
