```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses.
// Incorporate early exit conditions in loops to reduce unnecessary computations.
// Implement thread divergence reduction by ensuring warp-wide execution paths are consistent.
// Explore additional optimization techniques such as loop unrolling for the reduction loop.
