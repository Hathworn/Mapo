```
// Load data in chunked fashion to improve coalescing
// Double the loop stride to minimize warp divergence
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Perform a thread block reduction using shared memory
// Use unrolled loops for warp-level operations to reduce latency
// Store reduction results from shared to global memory only once
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring proper data alignment
