```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by coalescing global memory reads and writes
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and latency
// Ensure optimal block and thread dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Align data on word boundaries to improve memory access efficiency
// Reduce redundant __syncthreads() calls where synchronization is not necessary
