// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing to minimize memory access time.
// Consider using 4-byte or 8-byte transactions for better bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize vectorized instructions to optimize memory throughput.
// Adjust grid and block sizes to ensure optimal occupancy and load balancing.
