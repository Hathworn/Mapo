```cpp
// Cache scale_factor squared to avoid recomputation in nested loops
// Consider using shared memory to cache commonly used data for reduced global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures appropriately
// Perform loop unrolling where applicable to optimize repeated computations
```
