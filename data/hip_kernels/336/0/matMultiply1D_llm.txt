```
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce repeated global memory access for matA.
// Consider unrolling the inner loop to improve performance.
// Ensure collaborative loading in shared memory with correct index usage.
// Optimize memory access patterns for matB to coalesce memory reads.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads in a block follow similar execution paths.
