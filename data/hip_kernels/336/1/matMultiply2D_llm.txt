```
// Consider enabling loop unrolling to enhance computational throughput.
// Ensure memory coalescing for loading matrix A into shared memory.
// Ensure memory coalescing for loading matrix B into shared memory.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access by padding if necessary.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to synchronize threads across block.
// Consider using float4 or float2 if applicable to utilize vectorized instructions.
// Ensure result writing is coalesced to enhance memory write efficiency.
