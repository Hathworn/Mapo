```
// Use shared memory for better access patterns if arrays are reused
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for contiguous data
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
// Investigate if memory alignment can be improved
// Use constant memory if input sizes are known at compile time
