```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to improve performance.
// Use shared memory if possible to further optimize memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring threads access different banks.
// Consider using vectorized data types for memory operations.
