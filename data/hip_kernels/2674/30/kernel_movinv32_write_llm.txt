```
// Use memory coalescing to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider leveraging shared memory for common data across threads
// Investigate the impact of padding to avoid memory bank conflicts
// Optimize loop unrolling further based on hardware specifications
// Ensure that variable k is accurately calculated to maintain pattern correctness
