```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access times.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve throughput.
// Pre-fetch data into registers if possible to minimize latency.
// Align data structures to the size of cache lines to enhance memory access efficiency.
// Merge conditional operations to reduce branching and improve performance.
