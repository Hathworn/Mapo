// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring warp-wide conditions
// Align memory accesses to reduce bank conflicts
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved performance
// Optimize register usage to prevent spilling to local memory
// Leverage compiler flags for aggressive optimization
