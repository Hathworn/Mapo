```c
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput.
// Minimize stride in memory access patterns to reduce memory divergence.
// Use shared memory to lower global memory access latency if data reuse is possible.
// Check alignment of writes to prevent performance penalties.
// Optimize block size to ensure a good balance between occupancy and latency hiding.
// Avoid bank conflicts for shared memory if applied.
