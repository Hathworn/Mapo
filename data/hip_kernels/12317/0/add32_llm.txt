// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently reused data
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures to optimal sizes
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize overhead and increase throughput
// Experiment with varying block and grid sizes to find the optimal configuration
