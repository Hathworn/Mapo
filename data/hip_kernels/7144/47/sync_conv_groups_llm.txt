// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access by all threads in a warp.
// Minimize the use of barriers to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Utilize vectorized data types for memory accesses, when possible.
// Ensure data is aligned to memory boundaries for efficient access.
