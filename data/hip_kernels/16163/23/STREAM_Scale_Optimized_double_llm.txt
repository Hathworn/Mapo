// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory alignment for better coalesced memory access.
// Assess occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes to maximize device utilization.
// Check for bank conflicts and optimize shared memory usage accordingly.
// Minimize register usage to allow for higher occupancy.
