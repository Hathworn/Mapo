```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for all threads
// Consider prefetching data to L1 cache
// Use shared memory if data reuse is possible among threads within a block
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy while minimizing register and shared memory usage
// Experiment with different grid configurations to find the best performance
