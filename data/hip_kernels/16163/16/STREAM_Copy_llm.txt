```cpp
// Use shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Align data structures to facilitate optimal aligned memory access patterns
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching to hide memory latency
```
