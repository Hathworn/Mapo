```
// Unroll loop for better parallelism and memory access pattern
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Consider using shared memory if there are frequent accesses to the same data by multiple threads
// Optimize launch configuration by balancing between block size and number of blocks for the given hardware
