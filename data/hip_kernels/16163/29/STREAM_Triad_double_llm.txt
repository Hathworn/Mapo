```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads to contiguous memory blocks
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Minimize divergence by organizing data processing to avoid conditional branches
// Consider using vectorized types to process multiple elements per thread
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory usage and adjust indexing accordingly
