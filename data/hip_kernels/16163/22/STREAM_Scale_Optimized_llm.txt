```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous threads for sequential elements
// Consider using shared memory cache to reduce global memory access latency for a[i]
// Optimize occupancy by balancing block size vs register/memory usage
// Use a compile-time constant for block size to maximize efficiency
