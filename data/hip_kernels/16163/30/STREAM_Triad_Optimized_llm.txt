```
// Minimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads reuse elements of 'a' or 'b'
// Ensure that the kernel is launched with an optimal block size for the target GPU
// Explore use of vectorized loads and stores if possible, for higher memory throughput
// Profile kernel to identify potential warp divergence and adjust thread execution accordingly
// Use occupancy calculator to determine optimal grid and block dimensions
// Consider loop unrolling for the computation to reduce instruction overhead
