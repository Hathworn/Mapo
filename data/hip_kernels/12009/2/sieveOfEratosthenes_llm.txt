```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses wherever possible for better memory throughput
// Use __syncthreads() if shared memory is implemented to ensure data consistency
// Minimize divergent branches to improve the performance of the kernel
