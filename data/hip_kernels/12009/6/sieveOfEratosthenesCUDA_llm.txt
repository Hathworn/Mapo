```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables such as primes array.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures to CUDA memory architecture.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to reduce iteration overhead and increase throughput.
// Examine use of atomic operations if data races are observed in the global memory updates.
