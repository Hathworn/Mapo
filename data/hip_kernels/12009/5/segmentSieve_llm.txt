```c
// Consider increasing the size of sharedPrimes if maxRoot exceeds 1024.
// Ensure that global memory accesses coalesce properly for better throughput.
// Use constant memory if certain values are reused frequently and do not change.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() if threads can be synchronized more efficiently.
// Perform loop unrolling manually to reduce the overhead of loop control.
// Optimize index calculations to minimize computational load within the kernel.
// Consider larger block sizes if occupancy and register usage allow.
// Ensure that branching is minimized for better warp execution.
