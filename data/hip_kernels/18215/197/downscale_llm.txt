```
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data in order to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns by adjusting thread block configurations for better coalescing
// Reduce redundant calculations of scale_d2 and scale_d3 by caching them outside of the loops
// Utilize the __restrict__ keyword in pointers for more efficient memory access
