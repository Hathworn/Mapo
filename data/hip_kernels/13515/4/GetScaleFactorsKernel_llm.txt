```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Utilize local registers instead of shared memory when possible to maximize speed.
// Prefetch global memory data into shared memory for better memory access patterns.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures properly in global memory.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by carefully organizing data access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to minimize loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Use atomic operations only when necessary to prevent performance bottleneck due to global synchronization.
