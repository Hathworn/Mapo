```
// Consider reducing shared memory size if numElements is less than 1024 to avoid unused memory allocation
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for loads from global to shared memory
// Make sure __syncthreads() is used correctly to prevent data hazards
// Check if using __restrict__ pointers can help with compiler optimizations
// Verify if loop unrolling improves performance in the computation step
// Evaluate using warp shuffle operations instead of shared memory if applicable
