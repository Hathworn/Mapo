// Optimize memory access by calculating surface offset outside the conditionals.
// Use shared memory to improve data access for Pts if accessed multiple times.
// Minimize divergence by evaluating conditions with minimal branching.
// Consider loop unrolling for calculations involving Pts to reduce instruction count.
