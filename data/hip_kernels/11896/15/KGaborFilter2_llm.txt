```
// Combine memory operations to reduce memory transactions
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced
// Minimize divergent branches for performance improvement
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Align data to ensure better coalesced access
// Use constant memory for read-only data if possible
