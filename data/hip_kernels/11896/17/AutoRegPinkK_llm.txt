```
// Use a local variable for accumulation to minimize repeated global memory accesses
// Consider using shared memory if data can be reused across threads
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring data is accessed sequentially
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
// Analyze if loop unrolling can be beneficial for the inner loop
