// Consider coalesced memory access for src to improve bandwidth
// Ensure pitch is aligned to improve memory access pattern
// Use shared memory if multiple threads require the same data
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size accordingly for optimal performance
// Utilize the least divergent execution paths in the loop
