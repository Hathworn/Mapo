// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for filter and Vr pointers to improve memory access speed.
// Try to use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize the use of double precision for faster computation unless high precision is necessary.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread indices optimally.
// Explore using texture or surface memory for better caching and access patterns.
