```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data for optimal read patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like maxProbs and labelProbs
// Minimize divergent branches, especially with conditions leading to different code paths
// Leverage faster mathematical functions like __logf for performance gains
// Use appropriate data types and conversion methods to prevent unnecessary overheads
