```c
// Use __shared__ memory to minimize global memory access and optimize memory access patterns
// Efficient handling of boundary condition to prevent out-of-bounds access
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce thread divergence and improve performance
// Use warp-level optimizations with volatile to enhance performance within a warp
// Ensure result write-back is limited to first thread to reduce unnecessary memory operations
```
