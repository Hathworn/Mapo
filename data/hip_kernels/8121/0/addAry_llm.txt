```
// Try to coalesce memory accesses to ary1 and ary2 for better memory throughput.
// Ensure that ary1 and ary2 are allocated in continuous memory spaces.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling if the operation can be repeated and performance can benefit.
