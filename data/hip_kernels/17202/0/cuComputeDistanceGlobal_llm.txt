```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access latency.
// Remove redundant synchronizations if data dependencies allow to improve performance.
// Consider loop unrolling the inner loop further if registers allow for better performance.
// Ensure global memory store operations are coalesced for efficient memory bandwidth utilization.
