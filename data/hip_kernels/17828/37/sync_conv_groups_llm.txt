```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to enhance memory throughput.
// Minimize memory bank conflicts in shared memory for better performance.
// Overlap data transfer and computation where possible to hide latency.
// Optimize thread-to-data mapping for better load balancing.
// Reduce register usage to allow for higher occupancy.
// Consider occupancy tuning to find the optimal number of blocks per SM.
