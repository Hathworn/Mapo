```
// Consider aligning data to cache line size for better memory coalescing
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling if computation becomes heavier
// Ensure that block and grid sizes are optimized for target GPU architecture
// Minimize divergence within warps by ensuring uniformity in execution paths
// Use shared memory to optimize data access if applicable for more complex kernels
