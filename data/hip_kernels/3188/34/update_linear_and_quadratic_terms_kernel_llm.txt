// Ensure cur_tot_weight is stored in shared memory if reused multiple times
// Consider using a memory coalescing strategy for quadratic and linear arrays
// Utilize warp-synchronous programming for operations within the same warp
// Evaluate benefits of shared memory for commonly accessed elements
// Balance grid and block dimensions for optimal load distribution
