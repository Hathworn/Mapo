// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning Ar and Aw to the warp size
// Use shared memory to store Ar and Aw values to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize use of registers by minimizing index calculations in the loop
// Consider loop unrolling if the row_length is fixed and known at compile time
// Provide enough threads per block to fully utilize GPU resources
