```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Align data structures to at least 32-byte boundaries to enhance cache utilization
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory where applicable
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching to optimize memory throughput
// Adjust block size to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient utilization of GPU resources
