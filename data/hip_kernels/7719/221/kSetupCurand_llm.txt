```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if state accesses are repeated
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
// If applicable, use asynchronous memory operations to overlap computation and data transfer
```
