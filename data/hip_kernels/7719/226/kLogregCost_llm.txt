```
// Consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization to reduce __syncthreads overhead.
// Optimize global memory accesses by coalescing memory reads and writes.
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution by aligning control flow paths.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed data, like numCases and numOut, to reduce global memory traffic.
// Evaluate if using texture memory can benefit uncoalesced accesses for probability values.
