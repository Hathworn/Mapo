```
// Consider coalescing global memory access by adjusting memory layout
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for repeated values
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimal for the hardware architecture
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques to reduce latency
// Align data in memory to improve access speed
