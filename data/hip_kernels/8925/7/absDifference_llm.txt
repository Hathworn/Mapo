// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access by ensuring continuous memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for global memory reads and writes
// Check if using vectorized reads (e.g., double2) might improve performance
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block and grid dimensions
