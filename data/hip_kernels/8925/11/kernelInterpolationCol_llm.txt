```cpp
// Reduce global memory access by using shared memory for intermediate results.
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses by organizing threads to access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use warp-based computation where possible for better performance.
```
