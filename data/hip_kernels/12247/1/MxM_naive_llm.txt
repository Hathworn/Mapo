```
// Consider using shared memory to store sub-blocks of A and B to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for matrices A, B, and C
// Use loop unrolling within the dot product computation for improved instruction throughput
// Utilize thread synchronization after loading sub-blocks into shared memory
// Optimize block and grid size to match the GPU architecture and maximize occupancy
