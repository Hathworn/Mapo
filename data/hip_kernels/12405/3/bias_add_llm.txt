```
// Consider using shared memory to store input data to optimize memory access patterns.
// Coalesced memory access can be improved by ensuring columns are accessed sequentially.
// Reduce global memory accesses by computing biasIndex using a precalculated offset.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by selecting appropriate block size based on device capabilities.
// Minimize divergent branches by aligning thread execution paths.
