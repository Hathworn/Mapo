```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread blocks
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize latency
// Use __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions in shared memory
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring contiguous data access
```
