```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access when possible.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by adjusting block size based on register and shared memory usage.
// Minimize divergent branching within the loop for better performance.
// Align data structures to cache line sizes to reduce memory access latency.
