// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory accesses.
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and throughput.
// Minimize data transfers between the host and device to reduce latency.
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to enhance access speed.
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives for divergent paths to improve efficiency.
// Apply loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Consider tuning kernel launch parameters for specific GPU architectures.
