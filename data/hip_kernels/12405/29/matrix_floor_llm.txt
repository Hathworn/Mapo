```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if further computation is needed on matrix elements
// Check if employing a different block size improves performance due to memory access patterns
// Assess occupancy and adjust block size or number of registers if necessary
