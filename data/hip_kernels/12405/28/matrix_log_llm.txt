```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Consider increasing shared memory size if data does not fit
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory to maximize throughput
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access for better performance
