// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring C[index] and A[index] are accessed in sequence.
// Employ shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory bandwidth usage.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize parallelism and occupancy.
// Ensure index calculations avoid redundant computations outside the if-check.
