```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by aligning data structures to ensure consecutive threads access consecutive elements in memory.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve data locality.
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize thread utilization and reduce overhead.
// Use loop unrolling to decrease branching and improve execution efficiency.
