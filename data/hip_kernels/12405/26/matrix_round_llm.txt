```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for improved memory access speed.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for operations that can be parallelized.
// Use a grid-stride loop to improve performance for larger datasets.
