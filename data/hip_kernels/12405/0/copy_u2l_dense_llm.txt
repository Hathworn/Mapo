// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by adjusting memory access patterns
// Minimize thread divergence by simplifying boundary checks
// Use loop unrolling if applicable for further performance gains
// Adjust block size and grid size for optimal occupancy
