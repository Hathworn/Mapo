```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring data is read in contiguous chunks
// Ensure the grid and block sizes are optimal for the GPU architecture
// Determine if shared memory utilization could further optimize performance
// Consider pre-fetching data to L1/L2 cache if available and beneficial
// Analyze whether loop unrolling techniques can be applied for further optimization
// Verify if memory alignment can be improved to maximize bandwidth
// Investigate if reducing precision from double to float might be acceptable for performance gains
