```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if possible
// Optimize data prefetching for ipOffset to minimize pipeline stalls
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for ip data loading
// Use warp-synchronous programming model to enhance work units execution efficiency
// Evaluate using memory coalescing strategy for reading ip data
// Reduce arithmetic intensity by pre-computing constant values outside the loop
