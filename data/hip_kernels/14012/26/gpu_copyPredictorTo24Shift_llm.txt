```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring global memory accesses are coalesced.
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data within the kernel.
// Minimize the use of arithmetic operations by precalculating constants if possible.
// Ensure alignment of data types to prevent wasted memory accesses and improve performance.
// Reduce index calculations by restructuring threads and data layout.
