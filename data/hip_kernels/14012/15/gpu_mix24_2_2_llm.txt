```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory load latency.
// Evaluate coalesced memory access patterns for `ip` to enhance bandwidth.
// Use `__ldg()` intrinsic for read-only data to leverage read-only cache.
// Ensure thread block size is optimal for the hardware to maximize occupancy.
