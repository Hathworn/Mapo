```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by appropriately padding arrays if necessary
// Use vectorized data types where possible to increase memory transaction efficiency
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing the number of variables and reusing them
// Enable compiler optimizations flags for better instruction scheduling and resource allocation
