```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory reads
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory to increase memory access speed
// Explore occupancy improvements by adjusting block size or using more optimized resource allocation
// Align memory accesses to ensure they are suitable for the GPU architecture being used
