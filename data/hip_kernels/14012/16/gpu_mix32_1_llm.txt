```
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to hold intermediate values for faster memory access
// Apply loop unrolling for the main calculation loop to increase performance
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce bank conflicts
// Optimize conditional statements to minimize branching within warps
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to reduce access latency
