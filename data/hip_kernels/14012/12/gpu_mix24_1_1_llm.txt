```
// Consider coalescing memory access for `ip` by ensuring threads access contiguous elements.
// Use `__restrict__` keyword for pointer parameters to suggest compiler optimizations.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and enhance data reuse.
// Ensure `ipCurrent` pointer is aligned optimally for better performance on certain GPUs.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for operations involving `l` and `r` to reduce loop overhead.
// Minimize data type conversions to reduce extra instructions and improve throughput.
