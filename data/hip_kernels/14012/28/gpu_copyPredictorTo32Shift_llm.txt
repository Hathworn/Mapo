```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for both 'in' and 'shift' arrays.
// Use shared memory to store relevant data from 'in' or 'shift' for reducing global memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned for 'op' writes to avoid performance penalties.
// Consider using faster intrinsic functions if available for shift and bitwise operations.
// Pre-load data into registers when possible to reduce memory latency.
// Reduce the use of division operations in index calculations whenever possible.
