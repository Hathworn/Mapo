```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns by using coalesced memory accesses
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared or global memory
// Consider pre-loading data into shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses
// Reduce the usage of 32-bit integer operations in favor of bitwise operations where applicable
```
