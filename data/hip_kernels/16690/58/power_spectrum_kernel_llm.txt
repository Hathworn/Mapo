```cpp
// Consider optimizing memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure __syncthreads is used appropriately to synchronize threads
// Reduce the number of loads by using float2 for complex numbers
// Handle special cases with minimal threads to avoid divergence
