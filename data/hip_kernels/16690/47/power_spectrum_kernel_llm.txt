```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for Ar and Aw to improve memory throughput
// Evaluate using shared memory for temporary storage if there are repeated memory accesses
// Explore employing the `__restrict__` keyword on pointers to hint at non-aliasing for better compiler optimization
// Investigate using warp shuffle operations to reduce memory accesses if applicable
// Assess leveraging asynchronous copy operations if the data size and access pattern allow
