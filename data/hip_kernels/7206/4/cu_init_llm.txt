```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced access
// Consider using shared memory to improve performance if random states can be reused within blocks
// Ensure sufficient blocks and threads for full GPU utilization
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp either exit or execute similar instructions
```
