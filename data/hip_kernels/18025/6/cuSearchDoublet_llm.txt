```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed variables like rM and zM to reduce global memory reads
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern by using contiguous threads to access contiguous data in memory
// Use loop unrolling within the 'while' loop to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction throughput
// Avoid shared memory bank conflicts by appropriately aligning shared memory accesses
// Use atomic operations sparingly as they can serialize execution; consider alternative reduction methods if possible
