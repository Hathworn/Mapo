```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads and writes.
// Use shared memory more efficiently to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize shared memory usage to allow more active warps per SM.
// Align shared memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider using loop unrolling to improve performance in kernel loops.
// Ensure all memory operations are coalesced for maximum throughput.
