```
// Consider memory coalescing for better global memory access patterns
// Explore the use of shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to minimize synchronization overhead
// Check for warp divergence and optimize thread execution to maximize performance
