```
// Compute index once and reuse to prevent redundant calculations
// Reduce global memory accesses by restructuring data layout
// Coalesce memory accesses for `vbo_ptr` and `d_ptr` by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if accessing common data across threads to improve memory access speed
