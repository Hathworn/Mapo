```
// Consider using __threadfence_system for stronger memory ordering if needed.
// Evaluate if __syncthreads() is necessary for your specific use case.
// Analyze if there is potential shared memory usage and optimize accordingly.
// Ensure optimal block and grid size for maximum occupancy.
// Check for coalesced memory access patterns to improve performance.
// Investigate possible use of warp shuffle instructions to reduce memory access.
