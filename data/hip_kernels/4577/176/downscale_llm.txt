// Consider using shared memory to cache commonly accessed data for faster memory access
// Use memory coalescing techniques to ensure threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory by optimizing memory layout
// Ensure adequate thread utilization to maximize occupancy and performance
