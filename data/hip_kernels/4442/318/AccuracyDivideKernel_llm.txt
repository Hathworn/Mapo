// Consider using shared memory if accessing accuracy involves redundant global memory access  
// Minimize thread-divergence by ensuring warps less likely to have inactive threads  
// Ensure memory access is coalesced to reduce latency  
// Use fast math library functions if applicable to enhance computation efficiency  
// Evaluate block and grid sizes for optimal hardware utilization
