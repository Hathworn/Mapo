```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for coalesced access patterns
// Optimize memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory
// Unroll loops further for additional performance gains
// Minimize branch divergence by using conditional expressions
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better load balancing
// Prefer __global__ memory over __device__ variables for better caching
