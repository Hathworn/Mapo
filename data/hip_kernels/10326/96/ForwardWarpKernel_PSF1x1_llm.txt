```
// Use texture memory for accessing 'u', 'v', and 'src' to improve memory access speed
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Leverage shared memory to further reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced and optimized for cache efficiency
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and increase parallelism
// Evaluate warp-level operations for fine-grained synchronization improvements
