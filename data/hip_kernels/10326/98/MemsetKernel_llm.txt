```
// Use grid-stride loop to enhance memory access patterns and improve coalescing
// Ensure that 'value' is stored in registers for faster access during the loop
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to fully utilize available SMs and ensure no idling
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access overlapping data
// Align 'image' to a 128-byte boundary for best memory access performance
