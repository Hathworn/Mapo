```cpp
// Consider aligning memory access patterns for coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to load normalization factors if they are reused across threads
// Minimize divergence by ensuring branches are warp divergent
// Ensure memory is accessed in sequential order to utilize global memory bandwidth efficiently
```
