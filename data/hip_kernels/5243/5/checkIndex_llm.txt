```cpp
// Ensure memory access is coalesced where possible
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Minimize global memory transactions by using shared memory efficiently
// Consider using __restrict__ to aid the compiler in optimization
// Organize data to reduce cache misses
// Use appropriate memory access patterns to maximize warp efficiency
