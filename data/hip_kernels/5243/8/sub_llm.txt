```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning fData, sData, and oData appropriately
// Minimize memory transactions by storing frequently accessed data in shared or local memory
// Opt for using __restrict__ pointers if aliasing is not an issue to help the compiler optimize
// Consider using constant memory for frequently read constants if applicable
// Ensure optimal block and thread configuration to maximize occupancy
