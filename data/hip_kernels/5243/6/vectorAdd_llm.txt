// Use memory coalescing for better global memory access efficiency
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for maximum occupancy
// Consider using shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data occur
// Avoid bank conflicts by properly aligning shared memory accesses if shared memory is used
