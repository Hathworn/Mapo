// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads from gradOutput_data.
// Consider alignment of data types to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use constant memory for any values that remain unchanged throughout the kernel execution.
// Verify if reducing the precision of floats can speed up the computation without affecting accuracy.
