```
// Consider using float4 or int4 for coalesced memory access pattern.
// Ensure data alignment for better memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate using shared memory bank conflicts to reduce latency.
// Experiment with loop unrolling to optimize the loop execution time.
// Investigate warp shuffle instructions for better intra-warp communication.
// Profile memory bandwidth utilization to identify bottlenecks.
