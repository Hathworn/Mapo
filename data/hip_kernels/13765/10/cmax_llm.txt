```
// Consider coalesced global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized for occupancy and to reduce bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling strategies to decrease loop overhead in the reduction phase.
// Minimize global memory accesses by ensuring that necessary data is loaded into shared memory.
// Align data accesses with warp boundaries to utilize memory transactions efficiently.
