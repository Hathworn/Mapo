```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for each block to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement loop unrolling if possible to further optimize the throughput in data processing
// Evaluate if using float2 or other vectorized data types can improve memory coalescing and throughput
// Explore the use of cooperative groups for better block-wide synchronization and collaboration, if applicable
