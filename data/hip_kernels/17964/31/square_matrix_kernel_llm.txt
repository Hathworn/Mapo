```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access for both reading 'feats' and writing 'feats_sq'
// Optimize thread block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance
// Explore loop unrolling if applicable for the square computation
