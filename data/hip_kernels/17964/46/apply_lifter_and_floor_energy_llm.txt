```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to 'lifter_coeffs' and 'features'.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant loads of 'lifter_coeffs' within a block.
// Ensure 'blockDim.x' is optimized for available GPU hardware (e.g., warp size).
// Vectorize reads/writes to 'feats' when possible to improve memory bandwidth.
// Confirm memory alignment for best performance, especially with 'features' array.
// Evaluate the benefit of loop unrolling for the lifter coefficients application.
// Optimize 'log_energy' access pattern to reduce global memory latency.
// Minimize branch divergence in 'if' condition checks for thread consistency.
