```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing input/output memory layout
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for input and output pointers to help compiler optimizations
// Consider prefetching input data to shared memory if further optimization is needed
// Check for warp divergence and try to minimize it
// Profile memory utilization and attempt loop unrolling or other techniques if beneficial
