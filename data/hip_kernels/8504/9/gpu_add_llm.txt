```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by threads in the same warp
// Use shared memory to store data temporarily for faster access
// Prefer larger blocks to increase the computation-to-memory access ratio
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance
// Consider using memory prefetching to hide memory latency
