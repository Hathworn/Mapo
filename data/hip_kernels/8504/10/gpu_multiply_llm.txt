```cpp
// Avoid unnecessary global memory access by using shared memory
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for loading A and B into shared memory
// Minimize synchronization by reducing thread divergence
// Ensure data from shared memory is reused efficiently before next synchronization
// Use tile-based computation to enhance data locality and reduce global memory bandwidth
```
