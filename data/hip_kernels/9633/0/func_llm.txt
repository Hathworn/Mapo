```
// Consider coalesced memory access for your_array for improved memory throughput
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization delay
// Check if loop unrolling could be beneficial for the computation within threads
// Assess if using faster math functions or intrinsics could enhance performance
