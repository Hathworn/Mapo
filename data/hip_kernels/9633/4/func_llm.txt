```
// Consider using shared memory for coalesced access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced to optimize performance
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling to decrease the number of iterations
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after accessing shared data, if applicable
