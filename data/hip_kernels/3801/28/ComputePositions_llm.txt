```
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory to cache data
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for better performance
// Prioritize shared memory usage for frequently accessed data
// Re-arrange instructions to maximize instruction-level parallelism
// Use of __syncthreads to prevent race conditions when sharing data
// Inline determinant calculations to reduce function call overhead
// Use __fdividef for faster division operations where possible
