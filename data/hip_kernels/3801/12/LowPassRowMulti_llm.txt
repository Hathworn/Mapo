```cpp
// Use shared memory to improve data reuse and reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize boundary conditions by preloading necessary data into shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have written to shared memory before proceeding
// Use loop unrolling to enhance performance by minimizing loop overhead
// Ensure memory coalescing on global memory writes for improved performance
```
