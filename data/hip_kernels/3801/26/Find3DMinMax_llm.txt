```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Avoid shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory access patterns.
// Minimize redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in shared memory.
// Consider utilizing warp shuffle operations for intra-warp reductions.
// Align shared memory arrays to reduce bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling techniques to reduce overhead and improve performance.
// Carefully manage synchronization points to optimize thread performance.
