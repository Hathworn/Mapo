```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads.
// Try aligning shared memory usage with warp boundaries for better utilization.
// Preload data into shared memory in a coalesced manner.
// Use `__syncthreads()` after shared memory operations to ensure correct data loading.
// Minimize the number of atomic operations by optimizing histogram computation.
// Unroll loops if possible to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
