```
// Use shared memory for d_Data1 and d_Data2 to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory reads
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for optimized data sharing within a warp
// Minimize branching in the subtraction operation by restructuring conditions
