```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for loading data from global memory to shared memory.
// Try using shared memory effectively to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by proper memory layout.
// Explore using texture or surface memory for potentially faster memory reads.
// Ensure arithmetic operations are placed to reduce register pressure.
// Use constant memory where applicable for frequently accessed constant values.
// Evaluate warp-level primitives to further optimize reduction operations.
