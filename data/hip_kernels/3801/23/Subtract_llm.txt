```
// Leverage coalesced memory access by aligning data to ensure sequential threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts and improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory if the kernel computation becomes more complex and can benefit from data reuse
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy and keep all SMs busy
