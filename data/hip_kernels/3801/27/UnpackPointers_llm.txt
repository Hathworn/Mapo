```
// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of minmax for better memory access patterns.
// Loop unrolling for processing each bit of val promptly improves efficiency.
// Use vectorized memory operations to enhance memory throughput when writing to ptrs.
// Optimize thread block dimensions for better device occupancy and warp efficiency.
// Ensure alignment of data for coalesced memory access to minimize global memory latency.
