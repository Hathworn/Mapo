```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for d_Data by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory addresses
// Consider using float4 or other vectorized types to reduce memory access times
// Optimize shared memory usage by dynamically allocating only the necessary size of minvals and maxvals
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() calls by optimizing the reduction loop
// Consider adjusting the block size to better fit the GPU's memory hierarchy and improve occupancy
