// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize performance.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Utilize more threads per block to maximize occupancy and resource utilization.
// Adjust data alignment to enhance memory access efficiency.
// Employ warp-level primitives for more efficient reduction.
