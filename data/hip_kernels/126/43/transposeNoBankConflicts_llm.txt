```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Adjust TILE_DIM and BLOCK_ROWS to optimize for specific GPU architecture
// Ensure TILE_DIM+1 prevents bank conflicts in shared memory
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads for shared memory usage
// Consider occupancy and register usage for optimal performance
