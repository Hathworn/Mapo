// Use shared memory to optimize global memory access.
// Minimize global memory accesses by loading data into shared memory.
// Align memory accesses to ensure coalesced reads and writes.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory.
