```
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data, reducing global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced access patterns for memory operations to minimize latency
// Use atomic operations only when necessary to prevent unnecessary serialization of threads
// Adjust block size and grid size based on empirical data to maximize occupancy and performance
