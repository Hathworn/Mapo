// Use coalesced global memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure the grid size is sufficient to cover all data for better occupancy.
// Consider batching operations if n is large to avoid excessive global memory transactions.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all shared memory operations are completed before reading.
