// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize memory access latency by ensuring a, b, and y are aligned properly
// Evaluate the possibility of using shared memory for intermediate computations to reduce global memory accesses
// Check for potential loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure full occupancy by optimizing grid and block dimensions based on the specific GPU architecture
