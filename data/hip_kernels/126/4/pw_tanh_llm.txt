```c
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data properly
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Optimize block and grid size for the specific architecture to maximize occupancy
// Check for memory bank conflicts and optimize shared memory usage
// Use appropriate compiler flags for the target hardware to improve performance
