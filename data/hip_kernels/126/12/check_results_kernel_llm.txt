```
// Consider coalesced memory access for x array by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements.
// Utilize shared memory if there are repeated accesses to x values across threads within the same block.
// Minimize branching within the kernel by using conditional assignments if possible.
// Use __syncthreads() if modifying shared resources to ensure memory coherence across threads in a block.
