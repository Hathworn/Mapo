// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads and writes
// Consider adjusting TILE_DIM and BLOCK_ROWS for better occupancy and performance
// Ensuring __syncthreads() is placed correctly to prevent race conditions
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for further performance gains
