```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for fixed, lost, and free arrays.
// Minimize redundant memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers.
// Use shared memory to potentially buffer accessed data and reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure memory access patterns adhere to half-warp aligned access to maximize performance.
// Explore opportunities for loop unrolling within the if statement to improve efficiency.
