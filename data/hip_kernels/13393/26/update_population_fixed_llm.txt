```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput.
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid bank conflicts and inefficient access patterns.
