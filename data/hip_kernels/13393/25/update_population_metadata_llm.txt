```
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider optimizing alignment and access patterns for global memory
// Evaluate thread divergence impact due to conditional statements
// Minimize synchronization overhead where possible
// Enhance memory coalescing by reorganizing memory access patterns
// Explore warp-level primitives for reduction instead of manual hierarchies
// Profile memory bandwidth usage and optimize based on the analysis
// Ensure block and grid dimensions align with hardware capabilities
