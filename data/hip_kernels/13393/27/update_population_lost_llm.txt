```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning data appropriately
// Load data into registers when possible to reduce memory latency
// Minimize usage of atomic operations, consider alternative reduction strategies
