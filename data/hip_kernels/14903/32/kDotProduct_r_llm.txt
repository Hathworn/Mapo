// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly
// Consider using float4 for memory access to improve throughput
// Optimize data fetching to reduce memory latency
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to avoid bank conflicts
// Implement loop unrolling for better performance
// Explore using warp shuffle for intra-warp reduction
