```c
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning data access patterns.
// Use __restrict__ keyword in kernel arguments to help the compiler with memory access optimization.
// Minimize synchronization points to reduce overhead and improve performance.
// Consider tuning block size for optimal occupancy and execution performance.
