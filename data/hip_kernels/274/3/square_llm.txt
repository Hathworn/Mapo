// Try to ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Use shared memory to cache data if d_in is accessed multiple times.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Use vectorized memory accesses if possible to leverage multiple memory transactions per instruction.
