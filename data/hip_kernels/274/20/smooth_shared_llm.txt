```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data from global to shared memory
// Optimize boundary condition handling to minimize divergent branches
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase data locality
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have updated shared memory before computing
