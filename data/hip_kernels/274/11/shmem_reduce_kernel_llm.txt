// Optimize shared memory access by using warp-level operations
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce synchronization overhead and increase parallelism within the kernel
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth utilization
// Use volatile keyword to avoid reordering by compiler and ensure correct execution within a warp
