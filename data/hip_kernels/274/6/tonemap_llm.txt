```
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations for d_x, d_y, d_log_Y.
// Use shared memory to cache d_cdf_norm values as they are accessed by multiple threads.
// Consider using warp-wide operations to optimize bin_index calculation across threads.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring the logic within if statements where possible.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to inform the compiler of non-aliasing memory regions.
// Consider prefetching data to improve memory latency hiding, especially for d_cdf_norm.
