```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory elements.
// Use shared memory to store neighboring elements to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider using __ldg() intrinsic for read-only data to potentially optimize memory reads.
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and ensure efficient use of the GPU's resources.
