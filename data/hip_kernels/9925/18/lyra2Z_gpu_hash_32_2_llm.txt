// Use shared memory to minimize repeated global memory access.  
// Ensure shared memory is allocated with the optimal size to fit thread requirements.  
// Utilize warp-level synchronization where applicable to reduce overhead of __syncthreads() calls.  
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threadIdx.x maps directly to g_hash[idx] memory locations.  
// Consider bank conflict-free access patterns in shared_memory allocations.  
// Minimize redundant computations within the kernel for better performance.  
// Cache frequently reused variables in registers to reduce global memory access.
