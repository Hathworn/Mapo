```
// Consider using shared memory for data that is reused within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads from global memory.
// Ensure the kernel is configured with an appropriate number of threads per block to maximize occupancy.
// Utilize vectorized loads/stores if applicable to increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that branches are uniform across warp execution.
