```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory traffic
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for better bandwidth utilization
// Limit the number of shared memory accesses to reduce shared memory bank conflicts
// Consider using local variables for intermediate computation results
// Align data structures to memory boundaries for optimal access patterns
// Balance the workload among threads to prevent divergence and idle threads
