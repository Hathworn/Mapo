```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access for 'delta'. 
// Consider using shared memory to store parts of 'delta' that are frequently accessed.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if using shared memory for 'delta'.
// Prefetch 'variance[i]' and 'mean_delta[i]' into registers to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure the 'blockDim.x' is chosen such that it maximizes occupancy while avoiding excessive register usage.
