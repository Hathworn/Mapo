```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data.
// Consider using texture memory if data will benefit from cache locality.
// Optimize loop unrolling more aggressively if index calculations are simple.
// Pre-calculate common index expressions outside the nested loops to save on redundant computation.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when updating the output and indexes arrays.
