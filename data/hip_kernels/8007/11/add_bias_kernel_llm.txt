```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for repeated biases[j] reads
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures or adjusting access patterns
// Optimize step by utilizing warp-level primitives to handle more elements concurrently
// Investigate occupancy to ensure maximum utilization of GPU resources
