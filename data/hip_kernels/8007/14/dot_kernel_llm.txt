```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism.
// Minimize use of slow operations like sqrt by precomputing if possible.
// Try coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction instead of sequential accumulation.
// Ensure enough thread blocks for full GPU occupancy to hide memory latency.
