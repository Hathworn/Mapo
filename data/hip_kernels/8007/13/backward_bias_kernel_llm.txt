```
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Optimize shared memory use to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of loop control.
// Ensure that the number of iterations (size/BLOCK) is a multiple of BLOCK for full utilization.
// Analyze warps to ensure there are no divergent branches, especially inside loops.
