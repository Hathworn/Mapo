```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for X and Y to improve performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency if possible.
// Optimize index calculations to minimize arithmetic operations within the kernel.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy and utilize appropriate launch configurations.
// Explore memory alignment and data type usage to prevent memory access inefficiencies.
