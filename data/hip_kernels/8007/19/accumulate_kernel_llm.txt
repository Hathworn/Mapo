```
// Use shared memory to temporarily store partial sums before writing to global memory
// Consider using atomic operations if multiple threads accumulate to the same index in sum
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using stride-based access patterns for better memory load balance
