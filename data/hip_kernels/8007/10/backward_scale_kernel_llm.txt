```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure shared memory usage is minimized and effectively utilized
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize threads and avoid race conditions
// Check if loop unrolling could enhance performance for the inner loop
// Confirm occupational efficiency, maximize number of threads per block
