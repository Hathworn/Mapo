// Pre-fetch mean and variance to avoid redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous memory layout for input data
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize warp occupancy and reduce execution divergence
