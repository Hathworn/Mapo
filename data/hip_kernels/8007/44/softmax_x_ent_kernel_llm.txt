```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for better data reuse and reduced global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access to warp size
// Optimize loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the use of local variables inside the loop
```
