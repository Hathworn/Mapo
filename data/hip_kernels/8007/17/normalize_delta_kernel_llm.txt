```
// Consider coalesced global memory access to improve memory throughput for array 'x'.
// Investigate bank conflicts in shared memory if data is moved to shared memory.
// Utilize vectorized memory access if applicable for array 'delta'.
// Apply loop unrolling if repeatedly accessing arrays within a loop structure for performance gains.
// Ensure that the use of registers is optimized to avoid spilling.
// Consider using a warp shuffle function to reduce global memory reads.
// Align data structures to the memory word size to minimize unaligned accesses.
