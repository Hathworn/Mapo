// Consider increasing the size of shared memory if filters exceed 1024
// Ensure thread blocks are sized to avoid exceeding shared memory capacity
// Optimize loop order to maximize coalesced memory access
// Pre-compute repeated values outside of loops when possible
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
