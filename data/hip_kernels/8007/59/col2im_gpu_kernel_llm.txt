```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses within the loop
// Minimize bank conflicts by properly aligning shared memory usage
// Ensure that stride and padding are optimized to maximize memory access patterns
// Analyze thread block size and dimensions for optimal occupancy and performance
// Avoid divergent branching by refactoring conditions where possible
// Prefetch data into registers when used multiple times in the loop
