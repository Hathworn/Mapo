```
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory access latency
// Align memory access patterns to improve coalesced reads and writes
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for improved utilization of compute units
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if applicable to help the compiler optimize memory access
