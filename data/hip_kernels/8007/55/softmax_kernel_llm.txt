```
// Consider optimizing memory access by using shared memory.
// Reducing stride might lead to better coalesced memory access.
// Precompute values where possible to reduce redundant calculations.
// Consider aligning data structures to ensure efficient access.
// Use warp shuffle for reduction operations where feasible.
// Minimize accesses to output by combining computations.
