```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescence.
// Utilize vectorized memory operations where possible.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration.
// Adjust grid-stride loop for compatibility with larger datasets.
