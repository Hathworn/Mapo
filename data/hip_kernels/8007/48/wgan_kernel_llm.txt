// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for pred and truth arrays
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if applicable
// Analyze if loop unrolling can further enhance performance
