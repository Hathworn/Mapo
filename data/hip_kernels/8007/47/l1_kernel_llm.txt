// Consider coalesced memory access for pred, truth, delta, and error arrays
// Ensure each thread accesses consecutive elements in memory to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory if applicable to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to ensure full utilization of the GPU resources
