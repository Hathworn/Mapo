```
// Consider using shared memory for storing intermediate results to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize global memory accesses by first loading relevant data into registers or shared memory.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Optimize the softmax_device function by reducing the number of reads and writes to global memory.
// Ensure maximum occupancy by tuning block size according to the hardware specifications.
// Precompute values that do not change within the loops to reduce redundant calculations.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring optimal memory access patterns.
