```cpp
// Minimize global memory reads by loading input data into shared memory if possible.
// Consider using texture memory for reading the image data for improved cache performance.
// Unroll loops to improve instruction throughput and reduce branch divergence.
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced memory accesses.
// Align data structures to ensure proper memory alignment and avoid bank conflicts.
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations inside conditional statements.
// Use __ldg() intrinsic to cache read-only data when shared memory is not applicable.
// Consider using FP16 precision where possible to improve performance on supported hardware.
