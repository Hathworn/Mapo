```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Ensure alignment of data structures for efficient access.
// Utilize warp-based computations to reduce divergence.
// Minimize register usage to allow for more active threads per multiprocessor.
// Avoid bank conflicts if using shared memory for mask or x arrays.
// Optimize loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead.
// Use asynchronous memory transfers if host-device data transfer is required.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for potentially improved bandwidth.
