```cpp
// Consider using shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve memory throughput
// Implement warp-level reduction to decrease the time spent in summation
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns
// Minimize divergent branching to optimize warp execution
// Possibility of reducing synchronization by handling more reductions at the warp level
