```
// Consider coalescing accesses to X and Y to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster reads
// Reduce divergent branches by restructuring conditional statements
// Minimize the use of global memory by leveraging more registers if possible
// Align memory accesses for optimal memory performance
