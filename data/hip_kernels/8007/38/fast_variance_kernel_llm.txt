```cpp
// Use shared memory for loaded x and mean data to reduce global memory access
// Employ loop unrolling for the batch loop to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Increase the number of threads per block if possible to improve occupancy
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency
// Use float4 operations if data alignment allows
```
