```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize thread block size to match GPU architecture for better occupancy
// Utilize vectorized memory access if applicable
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring all threads of a warp follow the same execution path
// Align memory accesses to 128/256 bits to fully utilize memory bandwidth
