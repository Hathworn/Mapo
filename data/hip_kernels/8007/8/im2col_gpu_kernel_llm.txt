```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory access by adjusting data layout for potential speedup.
// Leverage shared memory to minimize global memory reads and enhance performance.
// Ensure data reused in loops is already loaded to reduce redundant memory accesses.
// Investigate optimal block size for better occupancy and efficient resource usage.
// Align memory access patterns to improve cache efficiency during read operations.
// Consider unrolling inner loops to reduce loop overhead and enhance performance.
