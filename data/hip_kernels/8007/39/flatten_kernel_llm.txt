// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced memory access for better performance
// Investigate the possibility of using texture memory for read-only data to improve bandwidth
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by optimizing conditional statements
