// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data, reducing global memory accesses.
// Access data in a coalesced manner to optimize memory throughput.
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory access performance.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to optimize execution efficiency.
