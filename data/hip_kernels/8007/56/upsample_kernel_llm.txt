```
// For better memory coalescing, ensure x and out arrays are accessed with indices that stride linearly
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed values like scale
// Evaluate if using faster atomic operations can help in the backward pass
// Minimize divergence by ensuring comparable workloads between threads within the same warp
// Check if using loop unrolling can optimize performance when accessing memory within kernel
