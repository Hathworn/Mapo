```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by making sure INCX is 1
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to match the hardware
// Prefer smaller block sizes for higher latency tolerance
// Consider occupancy tuning for optimal performance
// Make ALPHA a __constant__ variable if it doesn't change
