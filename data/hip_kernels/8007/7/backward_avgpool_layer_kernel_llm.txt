```
// Preload values to registers to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for in_delta by organizing threads accordingly
// Optimize stride patterns for better memory access coalescing
// Avoid unnecessary recomputation of expressions within the loop (e.g., w * h)
// Consider using shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory access
