```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Implement shared memory usage to cache data and reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize the calculation of `powf` by unrolling loops or using intrinsic functions
// Preload data into registers to minimize reloads from global memory
