```
// Cache frequently accessed global memory data in registers
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring condition checks are well-distributed
// Use shared memory for temporary storage if there is thread contention on global memory
// Align memory accesses for coalesced global memory transactions
// Minimize the use of powf by pre-calculating powers when possible
