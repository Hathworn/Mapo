```
// Precompute index to prevent repetitive calculation
// Optimize memory access by spatial locality in memory layout
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access in large loops
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers for potential compiler optimizations
// Optimize block and grid size configuration to match device properties
