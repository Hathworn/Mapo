```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses to 'clusters'
// Ensure 'surf2Dread' usage is aligned with warp sizes for maximum efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if accessing 'clusters' in a loop for better throughput
// Prefetch data if possible to hide latency in memory-bound scenarios
