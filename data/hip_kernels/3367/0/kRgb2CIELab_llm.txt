```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for tex2D fetches.
// Use shared memory to store pixel values within a block if possible.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal performance.
// Group threads with branch divergence to minimize performance loss.
// Use memory prefetching strategies for surf2Dwrite if applicable.
// Evaluate if using pitch linear memory could improve access times.
