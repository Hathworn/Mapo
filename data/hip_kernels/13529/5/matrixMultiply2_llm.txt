```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for A matrix elements.
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory throughput.
// Increase block size or use multiple streams to improve occupancy.
// Optimize loop unrolling further based on specific GPU architecture and matrix size.
