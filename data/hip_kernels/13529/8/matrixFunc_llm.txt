```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Use vectorized loads and stores if possible to optimize memory transactions.
// Explore asynchronous memory transfers to hide latency if applicable.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust the number of threads per block for optimal resource usage.
