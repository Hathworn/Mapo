```
// Consider aligning data access to coalesce global memory reads.
// Use shared memory to store tile data to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure all threads have loaded their data into shared memory using __syncthreads().
// Use shared memory efficiently by loading tiles of data for reuse in computations.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access for better performance.
// Optimize the loop to reduce shared memory store and load operations.
// Avoid redundant synchronizations to reduce overhead.
// Make sure grid dimensions efficiently cover the matrix to maximize occupancy.
