```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input and output arrays.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory load.
// Align data structures to ensure proper memory alignment and improve access speed.
// Implement more aggressive loop unrolling if appropriate for the specific hardware.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by having sequential threads access sequential data.
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if data alignment and access patterns permit.
