// Unroll the loop for input buffer copying and weights accumulation
// Use shared memory to buffer inputs for reducing global memory access
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance parallel execution efficiency
// Optimize atomic operations for reducing contention per thread
// Optimize memory access patterns by accessing data in a coalesced manner
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy and utilization
