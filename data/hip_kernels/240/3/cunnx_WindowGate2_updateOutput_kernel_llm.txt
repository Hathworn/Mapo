```c
// Use shared memory to cache inputs, reducing global memory accesses.
// Prefer coalesced memory accesses to improve access patterns.
// Use loop unrolling to maximize data throughput.
// Ensure all memory operations are fully coalesced.
// Evaluate using warp-level primitives to reduce __syncthreads overhead.
