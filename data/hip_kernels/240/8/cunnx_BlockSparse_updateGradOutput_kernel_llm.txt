```
// Use threadIdx.x spacing in the loop for improved memory access patterns and better memory coalescing.
// Perform reduction within shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure the synchronization barriers (__syncthreads()) are correctly placed to avoid race conditions.
// Consider using atomic operations if shared memory reduction does not fit your requirements for larger data sets.
// Optimize the division operation to avoid precision issues by adding a small constant to outputScale.
