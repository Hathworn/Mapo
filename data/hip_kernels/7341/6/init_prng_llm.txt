```
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved memory throughput
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring aligned memory access in shared memory
// Use asynchronous data copy when transferring data between host and device
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance
// Leverage constant memory for frequently accessed data constants
```
