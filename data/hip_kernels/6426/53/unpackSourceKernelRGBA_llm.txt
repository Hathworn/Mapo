// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking the dst memory alignment  
// Consider using shared memory to optimize the surface read operations  
// Investigate if the pitch can be minimized for better memory access patterns  
// Verify the utilization of optimal block and grid sizes for this specific use-case  
// Ensure the data type conversions are minimizing overhead and are efficiently handled
