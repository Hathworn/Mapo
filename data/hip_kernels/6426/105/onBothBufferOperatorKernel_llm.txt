// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Explore the use of texture memory for potentially better cache performance
// Optimize thread block size to fully utilize warp occupancy
// Ensure optimal grid and block configuration for maximum hardware utilization
// Evaluate possibility of loop unrolling for performance gains
