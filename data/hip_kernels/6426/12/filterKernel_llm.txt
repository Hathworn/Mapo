```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within the kernel.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to leverage caching if applicable.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Optimize memory access patterns to fully utilize the memory bandwidth.
