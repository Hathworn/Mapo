```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory with consecutive threads
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and reduce memory latency
// Unroll the loop during shared memory reduction for improved warp efficiency
// Utilize warp-level operations to perform final reductions without barriers
