// Unroll loop for better performance by processing multiple elements per iteration
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to inform the compiler about non-aliasing pointers for optimizations
// Ensure row accesses are within bounds before processing operations to prevent unnecessary loads
// Consider shared memory if row operations could benefit from reduced global memory access
