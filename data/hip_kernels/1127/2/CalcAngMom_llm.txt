```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like func_r_d to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider rearranging memory accesses to ensure coalesced memory patterns for arrays such as Mh_d and Rho_d
// Investigate whether using the __restrict__ qualifier could help with caching and performance
// Ensure that the thread work assignment is balanced to make use of all threads in a warp
// Examine if loop unrolling or any compile-time optimizations could reduce instruction overhead
// Evaluate the impact of floating-point precision and consider using intrinsic functions if applicable
// Profile memory bandwidth usage to identify potential memory bottlenecks affecting performance
