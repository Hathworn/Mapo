```cpp
// Use shared memory to store repeated trigonometric calculations to reduce global memory access.
// Consider merging contiguous global memory accesses to improve coalescing for Wx, Wy, and Wz.
// Organize data layouts to reduce strides in memory access patterns for better cache utilization.
// Use shared memory for intermediate variables like lon_cos, lon_sin, lat_cos, and lat_sin.
// Analyze potential for register usage optimizations by minimizing the number of double variables.
// Ensure that memory transactions are aligned to improve access efficiency.
// Evaluate unrolling loops where applicable to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Consider conditional execution paths to avoid unnecessary calculations for DeepModel check.
// Profile the kernel to determine memory bandwidth efficiency and address bottlenecks.
