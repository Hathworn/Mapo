```
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory efficiency.
// Consider vectorizing operations to increase throughput.
// Optimize parallelism by adjusting the grid and block dimensions.
// Use `__ldg` for read-only global memory access to take advantage of the cache.
