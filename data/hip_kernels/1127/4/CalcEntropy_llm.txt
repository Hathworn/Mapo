// Consider using shared memory for repeatedly accessed arrays to reduce global memory reads.
// Precompute and store common expressions to minimize redundant calculations.
// Use of local variables for frequently accessed data to reduce memory access overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to global arrays like pressure_d and temperature_d for better performance.
// Opt for aligned memory access where possible, to improve memory bandwidth usage.
