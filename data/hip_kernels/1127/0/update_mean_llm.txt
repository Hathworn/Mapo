```
// Consider coalesced memory access for pressure_mean_d to reduce memory access time
// Optimize Rho_mean_d memory access pattern for better performance
// Ensure Mh_mean_d updates are coalesced for efficient memory transactions
// Align Wh_mean_d updates to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider exploiting shared memory to store frequently accessed values for pressure and rho
// Investigate use of __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to aid compiler optimizations
// Explore loop unrolling techniques within the kernel for Mh_d and Wh_d updates
