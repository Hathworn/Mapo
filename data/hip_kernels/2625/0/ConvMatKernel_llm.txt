```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Use constant memory for the convolution matrix if it is read-only
// Opt for loop unrolling to potentially increase kernel performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for img_device and img_device2
// Explore using texture memory for global memory read reduction
