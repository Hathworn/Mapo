// Consider using shared memory for repeated access of RGB values in nearby threads to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to enhance memory throughput when accessing img_device.
// Evaluate the potential of loop unrolling for optimizing the computation of grayscale conversion.
