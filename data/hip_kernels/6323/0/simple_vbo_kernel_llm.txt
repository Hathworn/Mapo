```
// Use shared memory to cache data within blocks to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses with memory boundaries
// Consider loop unrolling if repetitive calculations occur
// Minimize divergent branching to maintain warp execution efficiency
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to reduce latency
// Optimize block size and grid size configuration to improve occupancy
