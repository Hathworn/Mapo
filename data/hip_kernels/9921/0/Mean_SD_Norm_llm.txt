```cpp
// Consider merging meansum and sdsum into single shared memory to reduce shared memory usage.
// Use loop unrolling technique to improve memory access patterns.
// Utilize atomic operations more efficiently where possible to avoid unnecessary synchronizations.
// Optimize the block and grid size for better memory coalescing and reduction of warp divergence.
// Minimize bank conflicts by adjusting the shared memory access patterns.
