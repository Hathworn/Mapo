```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Prefetch Y and dY values to registers to reduce global memory latency
// Consider increasing block size if shared memory allows for better occupancy
// Optimize reduction with warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
```
