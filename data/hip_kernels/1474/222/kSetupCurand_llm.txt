```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to optimize memory access.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized for better efficiency.
// Optimize grid and block size based on the target GPU architecture.
// Use asynchronous memory copy if data transfer is a bottleneck.
// Evaluate if using different random number generation libraries offers performance gains.
