```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize warp efficiency by aligning memory accesses
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Leverage constant memory for frequently accessed data
// Use vectorized read/write operations for coalesced memory accesses
