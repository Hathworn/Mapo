// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure padding in shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within the block for shared memory operations.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and reduce memory latency.
