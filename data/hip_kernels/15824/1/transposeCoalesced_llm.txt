```
// Ensure TILE_SIZE is chosen to maximize shared memory usage and occupancy.
// Align shared memory access to reduce bank conflicts by using TILE_SIZE+1.
// Use __syncwarp for more explicit warp synchronization if necessary.
// Leverage coalesced global memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores to further optimize memory transactions.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target GPU architecture.
