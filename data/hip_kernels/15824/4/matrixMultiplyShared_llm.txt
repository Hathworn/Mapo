```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Load tiles of A and B into shared memory collaboratively.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive global memory locations.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading tiles.
// Perform computation using shared memory to reduce global memory usage.
// Ensure computation completes before next tile loading with __syncthreads().
