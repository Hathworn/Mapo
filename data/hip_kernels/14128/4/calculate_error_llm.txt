```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Optimize global memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by padding if necessary.
// Consider using warp shuffle to reduce shared memory usage.
// Ensure enough blocks to hide memory latency by keeping the GPU fully utilized.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to reduce synchronization overhead.
