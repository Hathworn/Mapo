// Use __restrict__ pointers for better memory access optimization
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Evaluate using atomic operations for potentially simpler reductions
// Double-check shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling to further reduce overhead in the dot product computation
