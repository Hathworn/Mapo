// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for maxProbs and labels.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the probs array.
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead.
// Use ternary operators to simplify conditional logic and enhance readability.
// Evaluate using warp shuffle operations to minimize thread divergence in conditional assignments.
