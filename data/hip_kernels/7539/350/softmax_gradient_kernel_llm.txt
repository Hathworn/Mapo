```
// Reduce global memory access by coalesced memory alignment for input arrays Y, dY, and dX.
// Consider using double buffering or L2 cache for the reduction_buffer to mitigate shared memory bank conflicts.
// Replace loop with warp-level intrinsic for further optimization in reduction.
// Use dynamic shared memory allocation for reduction_buffer to handle varying dimensions efficiently.
// Leverage asynchronous memory prefetching for Y and dY to improve latency hiding.
// Minimize warp divergence in reduction loop by ensuring consistent thread participation.
// Optimize the usage of __shfl_down_sync to ensure alignment with HIP architecture specifics.
// Evaluate the block size and grid size to avoid under-utilization of compute resources.
