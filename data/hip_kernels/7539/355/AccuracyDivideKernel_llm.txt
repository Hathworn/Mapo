```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory latency.
// Ensure proper memory access patterns to optimize memory throughput.
// Utilize memory coalescing techniques where applicable.
// Investigate reducing branch divergence in the kernel.
// Evaluate the use of warp shuffling or other intrinsics for efficiency.
