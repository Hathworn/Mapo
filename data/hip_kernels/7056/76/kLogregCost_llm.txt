// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts.
// Ensure that the memory accesses are coalesced where possible for improved performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve access latency.
// Evaluate if __ldg() intrinsics can benefit by loading label values for better caching.
