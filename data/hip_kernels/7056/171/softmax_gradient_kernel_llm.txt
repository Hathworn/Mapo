// Ensure memory coalescing when accessing Y, dY, and dX arrays by aligning the memory address of data structures.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant reading of global memory, enhancing memory access speed for reduction operations.
// Implement warp-wide reduction techniques within blocks to optimize synchronization and improve performance.
// Minimize divergence within warp by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path during reduction and computation.
