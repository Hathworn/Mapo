```
// Ensure accuracy variable is allocated in global memory for kernel access
// Use shared memory if multiple blocks were needed to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using atomic operations if accuracy is updated by multiple kernels concurrently
// Ensure accuracy resides in suitable memory space to utilize coalesced accesses
```
