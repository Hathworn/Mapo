// Use shared memory to reduce repeated access to global memory.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the nested loop to reduce overhead.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing gradOutput_data in a linear fashion.
// Explore using atomic operations if race conditions occur during memory updates to gradInput_data.
// Reassess thread block dimensions to exploit maximum occupancy and hide memory latency.
