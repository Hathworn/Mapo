```
// Use shared memory to store d_in values for faster access
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring d_in accesses follow a pattern of sequential threads
// Ensure d_out write operations are coalesced by assigning output index based on idx without additional arithmetic
// Minimize divergent code paths by reducing conditional complexity or restructuring conditionals
// Optimize loop unrolling or vectorization if operations can be batched together efficiently
