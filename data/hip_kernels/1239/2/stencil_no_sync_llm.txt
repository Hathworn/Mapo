```
// Consider coalesced global memory accesses by aligning data properly
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Prefetch neighboring elements into shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Balance the workload across blocks to optimize resource utilization
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure data is read into shared memory before computation
