// Consider coalesced access to global memory for in and out arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce redundant global memory access, ensuring data is reused.
// Ensure proper synchronization to prevent race conditions when accessing shared memory.
// Analyze warp divergence to optimize control flow within the kernel function.
// Assess the block size for optimally utilizing the GPU's computational resources and memory bandwidth.
