```cpp
// Use shared memory for storing idx and priority to minimize global memory access
// Ensure threads within a block load necessary data into shared memory, limiting data fetch
// Implement thread synchronization using __syncthreads() to ensure data consistency
// Early exit from loop upon condition satisfaction to reduce computation time
// Optimize shared memory allocation based on the maximum expected working set size
```
