// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize thread block and grid size to ensure maximum occupancy
// Apply loop unrolling technique for better instruction-level parallelism
// Consider warp-level memory access for coalesced reads and writes
// Evaluate the benefit of using __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments
