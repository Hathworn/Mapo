// Consider aligning data to prevent uncoalesced global memory accesses
// Use shared memory to temporarily store data to reduce global memory reads
// Ensure enough threads per block to fully utilize global memory bandwidth
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better memory coalescing
// Check memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts
