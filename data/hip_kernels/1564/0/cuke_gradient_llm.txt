```
// Consider using shared memory to cache repetitive data access patterns.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly.
// Check if data alignment can improve global memory access efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branching by refactoring conditional statements.
// Experiment with block and grid size for optimal occupancy.
