```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning pixel structure and calculating stride offset accordingly.
// Use loop unrolling for color calculations to minimize instruction overhead.
// Precompute constant expressions outside the core loop for efficiency.
// Optimize register usage to reduce dependency and latencies within calculations.
// Consider using texture memory for accessing pixel values if suitable.
