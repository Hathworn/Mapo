```
// Consider using shared memory to cache row_sum and col_sum to reduce global memory reads
// Ensure coalesced memory access for output by aligning the access pattern
// Optimize loop variable i by unrolling the loop if N is known at compile-time
// Limit the usage of arithmetic operations within the loop for better performance
