```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing output in a coalesced manner
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory reads for col_sum
// Increase thread block size for better occupancy if shared memory allows
// Align grid and block dimensions to warp size for improved execution efficiency
// Balance workload among threads to prevent potential divergence
