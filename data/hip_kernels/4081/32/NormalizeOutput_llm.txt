// Consider coalesced memory accesses for 'original' and 'to_normalize'
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory loads
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Ensure efficient use of registers and reduce register pressure
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for improved occupancy
