```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed vertices to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce branch divergence.
// Compute intermediate calculations outside the loop if possible to save redundant operations.
// Merge conditions to minimize branching and improve pipeline efficiency.
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
