// Ensure coalesced memory access by ordering threads appropriately
// Consider using texture memory for vx, vy if there are spatial locality benefits
// Avoid using divide operation inside the loop; consider alternative arithmetic operations
// Ensure alignment of data structures to avoid excessive memory transactions
