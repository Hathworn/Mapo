```cpp
// Use of shared memory for vertices loading to reduce global memory access
// Ensure all threads have completed loading vertices using __syncthreads()
// Avoid conditional divergence in the main loop
// Optimize the polygon winding computation by minimizing arithmetic operations
// Consider coalesced global memory access for input points and vertices
