// Consider coalescing the memory access to px and py arrays for better performance
// Use shared memory to cache vx and vy data if the access is repetitive within the block
// Utilize warp-level programming techniques to minimize branch divergence
// Evaluate the potential of loop unrolling in the for loop for increased processing speed
