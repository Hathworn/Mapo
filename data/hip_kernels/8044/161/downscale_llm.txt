// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses  
// Use memory coalescing techniques to optimize global memory access patterns  
// Ensure data alignment to prevent memory access penalties  
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory  
// Look into using asynchronous copy operations to overlap computation and memory transfers  
// Utilize warp-level primitives to reduce thread divergence during accumulation  
// Avoid unnecessary recomputation within the translate_idx_inv function by optimizing variable reuse
