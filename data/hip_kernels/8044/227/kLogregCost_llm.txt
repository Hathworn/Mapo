```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing probs in a contiguous manner for each thread.
// Consider storing maxProbs and labelProbs in shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use __ldg() for read-only memory access to labels, maxProbs, and labelp if they are likely to be reused.
// Avoid divergent branches where possible, especially within the loop comparing maxp values.
