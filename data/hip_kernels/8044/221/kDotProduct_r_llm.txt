```
// Consider using __ldg to load elements from global memory.
// Explore using vectorized loads to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Unroll loops further if the number of iterations is known at compile time.
// Use atomic operations if writing results directly to global memory.
// Investigate the potential for memory coalescing improvements.
// Evaluate if adjusting block size could yield better performance.
