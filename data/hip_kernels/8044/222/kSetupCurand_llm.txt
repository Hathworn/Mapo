```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Minimize global memory access by efficiently using shared memory
// Ensure kernel launch configuration optimizes occupancy
// Align data structures to facilitate efficient memory transactions
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to minimize thread divergence
