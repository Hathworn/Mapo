```
// Consider reducing global memory transactions by coalescing memory accesses for Y, dY, and dX.
// Restructure the loop to ensure continuous memory access which may improve performance.
// Use proper data alignment and padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Consider using loop unrolling to further minimize the loop overhead.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is placed correctly to synchronize threads effectively.
