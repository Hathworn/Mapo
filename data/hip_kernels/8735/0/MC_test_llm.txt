```c
// Consider improving memory coalescing for better global memory access efficiency.
// Ensure that hiprandState objects are used with proper alignment or caching strategies.
// Investigate the possibility of using local memory to store temporary variables like x, y, and l2norm2 if register pressure is not high.
// Look into optimizing shared memory usage by minimizing access and ensuring proper bank conflicts are avoided.
// Evaluate whether using more blocks with fewer threads per block could lead to better occupancy.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during the reduction phase.
