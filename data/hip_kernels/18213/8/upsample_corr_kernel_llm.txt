```
// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of curr_corr for reduced global memory access
// Use float variables for ratios to prevent repeated type casting
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures 
// Utilize loop unrolling if applicable for better pipeline efficiency
