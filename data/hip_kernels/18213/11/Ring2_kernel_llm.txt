// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed values such as corrAB and mask to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data that exhibits spatial locality.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques for inner loops to minimize loop overhead.
// Use appropriate data types to ensure coalesced memory accesses and minimize memory transactions.
// Optimize strided memory access patterns by rearranging data or using different memory layouts.
