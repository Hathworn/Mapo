```c
// Avoid recalculating memory stride for id1 accesses within the loop
// Remove redundant calculations by caching expressions that are used multiple times
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for id2 loop
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns in the for loop
// Use warp synchronous programming to avoid unnecessary global memory operations
// Consider reducing register pressure by minimizing temporary variables
