```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like minI and maxI
// Consider using a coalesced memory access pattern for reading I array
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for hist updates
// Ensure coalesced access pattern when updating the histogram array
// Minimize conditional branches within the memory-critical segments
// Optimize the calculation of bin index by reducing arithmetic operations
// Align memory allocations for better performance during array accesses
