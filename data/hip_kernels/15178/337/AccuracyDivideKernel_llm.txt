// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier on pointer for better load/store efficiency.
// Ensure accuracy is always allocated in global memory for coherent memory access.
// Evaluate if shared memory could benefit any other parts of the kernel execution.
// Examine if using streams would aid in optimizing copy operations for *accuracy.
