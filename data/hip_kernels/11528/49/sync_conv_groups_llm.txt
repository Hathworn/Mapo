```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to manage instruction overhead.
// Minimize thread divergence by avoiding conditional statements within loops.
// Optimize grid and block size for maximum warp efficiency.
