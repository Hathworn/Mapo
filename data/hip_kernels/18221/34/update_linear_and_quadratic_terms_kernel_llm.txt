```
// Consider using shared memory for quadratic and linear values to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Prefetch data to reduce latency, especially for large n
// Try loop unrolling techniques in the for-loop to enhance performance
// Minimize use of if statements within compute loops to avoid divergent warps on GPU
