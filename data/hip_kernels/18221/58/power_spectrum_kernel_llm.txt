// Move the conditional check outside the loop to reduce redundant checks.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Perform memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns for improved access efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads reach a synchronization point, especially when dealing with data dependencies.
