```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses
// Ensure all threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Maintain high occupancy by choosing optimal block size
// Consider loop unrolling for further performance improvement
// Ensure there are enough registers to prevent spilling to local memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after shared memory loads
```
