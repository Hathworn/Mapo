// Consider reducing shared memory usage by ensuring that only necessary data is stored.
// Minimize global memory access by optimizing data layout and coalescing memory accesses.
// Use the constant memory more effectively for data that remains unchanged across threads.
// Evaluate using registers to hold frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
