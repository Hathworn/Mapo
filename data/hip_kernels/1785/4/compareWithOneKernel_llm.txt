```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for a[i] and b[i]
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses if possible
// Optimize block size for maximum occupancy and performance
// Ensure that N is a multiple of blockDim.x for efficient execution
// Avoid branching by using a ternary operator if it improves performance
```
