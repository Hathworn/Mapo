```
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to common data
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to aid compiler optimizations
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Minimize register use by reorganizing instruction sequences
// Optimize block and grid size to maximize occupancy
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable
// Profile memory throughput to identify bottlenecks
