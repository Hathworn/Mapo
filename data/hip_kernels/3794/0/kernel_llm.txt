```cpp
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when possible
// Minimize divergent branching within warps for better performance
// Prefetch data to registers to hide global memory latency
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns
```
