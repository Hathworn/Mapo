```
// Increase BLOCK_SIZE further if registers and shared memory allow for maximizing data reuse
// Ensure coalesced access by aligning data access patterns with warp size (typically 32 threads)
// Consider tiling strategy with optimal TILE_SIZE for dimensional match of input matrix
// Use loop unrolling where possible to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Try using vectorized data types like double2 or double4 for aligned memory accesses
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by padding or changing memory layout
