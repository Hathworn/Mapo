// Use shared memory to prefetch data for gradOutput_base and indices_base to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize atomic operations by accumulating results in registers or shared memory before performing atomicAdd
// Consider using cooperative thread groups to optimize memory access and computation
// Align memory accesses in gradOutput_base and indices_base to be coalesced
// Implement loop unrolling for the feature loop to enhance performance and reduce loop overhead
