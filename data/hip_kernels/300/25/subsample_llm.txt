```
// Consider using shared memory to store block-wide reused input data to reduce global memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling techniques to minimize loop overhead within the kernel
// Evaluate the potential benefit of increasing the block size for better occupancy and further optimization
// Ensure memory coalescing for global memory reads and writes by aligning access patterns
// Leverage memory prefetching by utilizing nearby data during computation
