```
// Consider using shared memory to cache weight values to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for both gradInput and gradOutput arrays to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergences by ensuring warp-friendly control flows, especially in conditional statements.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for the inner loops to reduce the loop overhead and improve efficiency.
// Align memory accesses to take advantage of memory coalescing for ptr_gradInput and ptr_gradOutput.
// Avoid unnecessary recalculations, such as redundant calculation of the_weight for each thread.
