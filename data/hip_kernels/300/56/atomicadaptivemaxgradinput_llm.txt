// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced access.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using loop unrolling to potentially improve performance.
// Evaluate potential benefits of using `__restrict__` pointers for further optimization.
// Ensure alignment of memory to avoid bank conflicts and maximize access efficiency.
