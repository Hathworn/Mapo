```
// Improve memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory accesses
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if feasible
// Minimize divergent branches within a warp for optimal performance
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance loop efficiency where possible
// Ensure that memory reads and writes are aligned to reduce memory transactions
