```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for better memory access patterns
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive elements
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction throughput in critical sections
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Experiment with different block sizes to optimize memory transactions and occupancy
