// Consider coalescing memory accesses for gradInput and gradOutput to improve memory bandwidth.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts if shared memory is used for intermediate calculations.
// Evaluate if weight can be stored in shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory access.
// Assess if loop unrolling or other loop optimizations could reduce control overhead.
