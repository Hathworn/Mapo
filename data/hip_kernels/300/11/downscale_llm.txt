```
// Consider unrolling the loops to reduce branch overhead and improve parallelism
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for faster access
// Reduce the use of global memory access by using a local accumulator variable
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory alignment in shared memory
