```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Leverage shared memory for values repeatedly accessed by threads
// Ensure optimal block size for the device architecture in use
// Minimize divergence by ensuring coherent control flow among threads
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce overhead associated with loop control
