```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches by using early return
// Consider using prefetching techniques for better data locality
// Minimize usage of global memory by utilizing shared memory if applicable
// Optimize occupancy by tuning block size and number of threads
