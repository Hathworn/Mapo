```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses and increasing memory throughput.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if applicable.
// Optimize the choice of block size and grid size for maximum occupancy and performance.
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques if possible to hide memory latency.
