```
// Use coalesced memory accesses to increase bandwidth
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory access
// Utilize shared memory if access patterns are repetitive
// Minimize divergent branches in loop constructs
// Consider warp striding for better utilization
// Balance memory and compute for effective kernel execution
