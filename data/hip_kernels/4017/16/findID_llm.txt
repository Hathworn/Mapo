```
// Minimize memory access latency by ensuring data is coalesced
// Ensure all threads within a warp access memory in a sequential fashion
// Optimize register usage by avoiding temporary variables within threads
// Leverage shared memory if accessing elements that are used multiple times
// Consider adjusting block size to match the GPU architecture for maximum occupancy
