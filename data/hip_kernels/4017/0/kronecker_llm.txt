```
// Ensure aligned memory access to improve cache efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Avoid divergent branching by ensuring the if-condition is warp-friendly.
// Optimize memory access patterns to coalesce memory accesses.
// Choose block size to maximize occupancy while considering memory constraints.
