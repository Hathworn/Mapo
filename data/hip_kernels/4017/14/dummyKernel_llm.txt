```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Ensure memory alignment for efficient memory transactions
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize branch divergence within warps
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources
// Consider loop unrolling to improve instruction throughput
