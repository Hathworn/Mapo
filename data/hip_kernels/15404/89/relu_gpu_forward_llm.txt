```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures properly
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory access patterns
// Use warp-level primitives for operations within the same warp to reduce latency
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements if possible
// Make sure the input N is a multiple of the warp size for better performance
