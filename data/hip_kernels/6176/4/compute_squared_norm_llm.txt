```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for 'array' and 'norm' to improve memory bandwidth.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing the size of 'sharedData' based on block configuration.
// Consider unrolling loops where possible to improve pipeline throughput and reduce the overhead of loop control.
// Ensure the number of blocks and threads are optimized for the specific GPU to maximize occupancy.
// Investigate the use of warp-level primitives to further optimize reductions.
