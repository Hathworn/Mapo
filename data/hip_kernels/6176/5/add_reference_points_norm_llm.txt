```
// Use shared memory to minimize repetitive global memory accesses
// Simplify complex conditionals to improve instruction parallelism
// Align memory accesses for coalesced memory transactions
// Ensure efficient use of shared memory by limiting its size
// Minimize branch divergence for better warp execution efficiency
