```
// Consider using shared memory to cache `norm[xIndex]` to reduce global memory reads.
// Use coalesced memory access for `array` for improved memory throughput.
// Ensure proper alignment when accessing `array` and `norm` to optimize memory performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts if shared memory is introduced.
// Avoid divergent branches by ensuring warp-wide uniform execution where possible.
// Use a suitable block size that maximizes occupancy without increasing register/memory pressure.
