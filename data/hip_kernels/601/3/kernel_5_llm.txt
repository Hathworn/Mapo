// Use shared memory to cache data for better memory access patterns
// Consider using warp-level primitives for further optimization
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all warps are doing similar work
// Align memory accesses to avoid potential bank conflicts
// Use coalesced memory accesses to maximize memory throughput
