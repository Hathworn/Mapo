```
// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure data alignment when accessing shared memory to maximize memory throughput.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts and align data access.
// Use __syncthreads() carefully to synchronize threads after shared memory loading.
// Reduce conditional statements within the kernel for faster execution.
// Balance computational load across threads to avoid divergence and improve efficiency.
