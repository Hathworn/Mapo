// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to fully utilize coalesced memory reads.
// Unroll loops where applicable to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Minimize control flow divergence by aligning thread operations and boundary checks.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure threads access memory in a pattern that minimizes bank conflicts in shared memory.
