```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access within warp.
// Ensure data alignment in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization latency.
