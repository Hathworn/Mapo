```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory coalescing
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions during reduction
// Align shared memory usage to allow for better bank conflict management
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to further optimize intra-block communication
// Assess block size configuration for optimal occupancy and resource utilization
