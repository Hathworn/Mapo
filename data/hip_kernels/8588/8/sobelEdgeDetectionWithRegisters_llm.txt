```
// Consider using shared memory for accessing nearby pixel values to reduce global memory access.
// Combine multiple loads from global memory into fewer transactions to improve access coalescing.
// Implement loop unrolling for any repetitive operations within the kernel.
// Reduce global memory traffic by storing intermediate computation results in registers.
