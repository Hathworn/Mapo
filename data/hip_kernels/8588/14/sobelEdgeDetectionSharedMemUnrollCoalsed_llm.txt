```cpp
// Consider unrolling loops further to expose more parallelism.
// Coalesced memory access is achieved by loading data into shared memory in contiguous blocks.
// Ensure that shared memory usage is within the limits for the targeted GPU to maximize occupancy.
// Thread divergence is minimized by restricting operations to valid thread indices.
// Aligning data access patterns with the warp size may yield performance benefits.
