```
// Consider coalesced accesses to global memory for improved performance
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by proper data alignment
// Use warp synchronous programming if applicable to reduce __syncthreads frequency
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by selecting an appropriate block size
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
