```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Unroll loops to increase warp efficiency.
// Precompute indices to reduce redundant calculations.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads.
// Ensure proper usage of __syncthreads() for synchronization.
// Consider using half-warp calculations to enhance performance.
// Potentially adjust _UNROLL_ factor based on hardware architecture.
