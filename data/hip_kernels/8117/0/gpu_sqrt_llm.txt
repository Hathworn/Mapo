```
// Ensure data is aligned for coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize block size for maximum occupancy and performance
// Consider loop unrolling for increased arithmetic intensity
// Evaluate memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Use asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation and data movement
// Minimize divergent branches and increase warp coherence
