```
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved memory throughput
// Ensure appropriate use of shared memory if needed to reduce global memory access
// Investigate if loop unrolling could benefit performance in larger datasets
// Profile to determine if occupancy can be improved by adjusting block size
// Use __restrict__ keyword to indicate that pointer parameters do not alias each other
// Consider using constant memory if the data is read-only and reused by multiple threads
