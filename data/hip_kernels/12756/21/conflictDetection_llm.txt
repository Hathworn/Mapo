```c
// Consider coalescing global memory access for vertexArray and neighbourArray
// Increase shared memory usage to leverage higher memory bandwidth and lower latency
// Minimize divergence in the control flow by aligning the warp to the workload
// Investigate the possibility of load balancing across threads within a block
// Prefer using registers over shared memory when variable lifetimes are short
// Evaluate the potential to unroll small loops for fixed-size iterations
```
