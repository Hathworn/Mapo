// Ensure coalesced memory access in global memory reads
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
// Optimize boundary checks to minimize unnecessary computations
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance of degree calculation
