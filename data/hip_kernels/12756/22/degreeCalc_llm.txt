```
// Consider utilizing thread coarsening to increase each thread's workload
// Use loop unrolling inside the loop for faster execution
// Consider replacing atomic operations with warp-level primitives where possible
// Allocate more shared memory if necessary to store additional data
// Prefetch data to shared memory to further minimize global memory accesses
