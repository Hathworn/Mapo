// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by arranging the state array in a contiguous manner
// Minimize bank conflicts by aligning state array to the warp size
// Prefer shared memory for frequently reused data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider adjusting the block size to optimize occupancy and performance
