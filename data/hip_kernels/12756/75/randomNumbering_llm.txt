```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads/writes.
// Consider using shared memory for often accessed data within a block.
// Ensure aligned memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Minimize use of local variables to reduce register pressure.
// Ensure limited divergence by aligning block size with warp size.
