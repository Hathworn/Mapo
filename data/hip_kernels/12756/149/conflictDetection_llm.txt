```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing.
// Optimize memory access patterns for vertexArray and neighbourArray by ensuring accesses are coalesced.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for improved performance in accessing degreeCount values.
// Investigate if using atomic operations on shared memory can further optimize conflict detection.
