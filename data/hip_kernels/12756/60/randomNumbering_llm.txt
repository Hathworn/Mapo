// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Trade-off between register pressure and arithmetic operations can be considered to improve performance.
// Consider the use of warp-level primitives to reduce divergence within a warp.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by ensuring contiguous allocation of states for efficient memory access.
// Evaluate whether using a smaller limit may increase cache effectiveness for integer arithmetic.
