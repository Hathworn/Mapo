// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure vertexArray is aligned to reduce memory access times
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure kernel launch parameters (blocks, threads) are optimized for your device
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques for neighbourArray to optimize access patterns
