```
// Consider aligning data structures to improve coalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to ensure maximum occupancy and minimize idle threads.
// Ensure proper memory access patterns to utilize memory bandwidth effectively.
// Minimize the use of global memory where possible to reduce latency.
