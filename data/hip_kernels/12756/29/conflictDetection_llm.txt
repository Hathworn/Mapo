```
// Consider coalescing global memory access patterns by reorganizing data structures for vertexArray and neighbourArray.
// Use texture memory if frequent reads of the same data occur, benefiting from cached access in HIP.
// Evaluate the shared memory space size to ensure it fits within the architecture's limits and adjust the sharedDetectConflict size appropriately.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory accesses by ensuring aligned memory operations.
