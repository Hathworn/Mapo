// Consider coalesced access patterns for hiprandState to improve memory performance
// Evaluate use of shared memory for degreeCount if frequent access patterns are present
// Explore using shuffle operations to reduce random number calculation latency
// Optimize load/store operations by investigating vectorized memory access
