```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for vertexArray and neighbourArray.
// Optimize global memory access by using shared memory if accessing common elements.
// For atomic operations, ensure they are necessary to avoid serialization bottlenecks.
// Evaluate warp divergence, especially in conditional statements within kernel.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable in processing continuous memory blocks.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize repeated global memory access.
