```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures with warp size.
// Use registers to store frequently accessed variables like 'RANDOM' to minimize memory accesses.
// Optimize block and grid size to enhance occupancy and balance load between threads.
