```c
// Use shared memory to store random states for better memory access pattern.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for globalState and degreeCount arrays.
// Minimize use of shared local variables to avoid register pressure.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for further warp efficiency.
```
