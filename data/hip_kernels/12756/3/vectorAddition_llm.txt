```c
// Consider increasing shared memory usage when the block allows more threads
// Use __ldg() to load global memory more efficiently if data usage patterns allow
// Make sure the shared memory arrays are optimally sized to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used appropriately to prevent race conditions
// Adopt larger blockSize if shared memory usage limits are not exceeded
```
