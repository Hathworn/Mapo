// Consider coalesced memory access for degreeProc vertexArray to improve efficiency
// Ensure degreeCount data is accessed in a coalesced manner to optimize memory throughput
// For computeSum, consider reducing atomic operations to minimize synchronization overhead
// Utilize shared memory in computeSum if applicable to reduce global memory accesses
