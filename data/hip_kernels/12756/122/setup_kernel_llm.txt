// Combine computations for thread and block indices to reduce redundant calculations.  
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning hiprandState array access with thread ID.  
// Consider using shared memory or registers for frequently accessed data if applicable.  
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths for all threads.  
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to match the hardware's warp scheduling capabilities.
