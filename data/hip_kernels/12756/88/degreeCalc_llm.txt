```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring vertexArray and degreeCount are accessed consecutively
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditional logic for better warp execution efficiency
// Optimize memory access patterns in atomic operations for potential speed improvements
