```
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by careful indexing if localState requires more complex operations.
// Evaluate if reducing shared memory usage is possible while maintaining performance.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for your specific GPU architecture.
// Use the `__syncthreads()` only where necessary to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
