```cpp
// Use shared memory for degreeCount if accessed frequently across threads
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning access patterns for globalState
// Prefetch globalState[i] into registers if reused multiple times
// Consider using __ldg() for globalState if read-only to benefit from cache
// Investigate warp-level primitives for potential reduction in divergence
// Batch read-write operations to reduce global memory transactions
