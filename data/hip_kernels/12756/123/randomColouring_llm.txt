// Use shared memory to store temporary results for each block to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for global memory reads and writes.
// Consider reducing the size of data types if possible to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Align global memory access to reduce access time and avoid bank conflicts.
