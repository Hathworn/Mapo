```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for data re-use within blocks
// Increase occupancy by adjusting block size for better resource utilization
// Consider warp divergence issue and optimize conditional logic accordingly
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments if applicable to enable compiler optimizations
// Investigate potential for loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
