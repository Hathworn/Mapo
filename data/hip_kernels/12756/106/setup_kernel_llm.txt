```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning hiprandState in memory
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads within a block reuse state
// Optimize block and grid size based on hardware limits for maximum occupancy
// Use asynchronous memory operations if applicable to overlap computation and data transfer
```
