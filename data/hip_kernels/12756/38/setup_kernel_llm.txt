```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Evaluate using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Look into using warp-aggregated atomics if atomic operations are present
// Check if loop unrolling could further optimize performance
// Ensure alignment of data structures for efficient memory transactions
// Use asynchronous memory copies where applicable to overlap computation and communication
