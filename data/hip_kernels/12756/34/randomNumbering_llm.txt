```c
// Use coalesced memory access for degreeCount array to improve memory throughput.
// Prefetch hiprandState to shared memory to reduce global memory latency.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for efficient state updates when possible.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
