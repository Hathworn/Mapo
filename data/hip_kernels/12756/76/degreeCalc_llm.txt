```
// Consider using shared memory for vertexArray to reduce global memory latency if it is accessed multiple times
// Coalesce memory accesses in neighbourArray and degreeCount to improve memory throughput
// Minimize the use of atomic operations in the first kernel as they can be a bottleneck
// Ensure memory alignment for better performance on global memory accesses
