```
// Consider using a grid-stride loop for better load balancing across threads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking memory alignment of globalState and degreeCount.
// Limit the use of atomic operations if applicable to reduce contention and improve throughput.
// Minimize the state storage overhead by updating localState within the grid-stride loop.
