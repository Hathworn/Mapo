```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Evaluate the use of registers to store frequently accessed variables instead of global memory
// Profile the kernel to identify bottlenecks in memory access
// Ensure alignment of data structures in memory for efficient access
