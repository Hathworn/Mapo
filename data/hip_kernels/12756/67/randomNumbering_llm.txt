```
// Consider using shared memory to temporarily store degreeCount values before writing them back to global memory.
// Strive for coalesced memory accesses when fetching and storing data from/to globalState.
// Update the globalState only after computations for better performance.
// Minimize the number of writes to global memory by updating the degreeCount in shared memory first.
