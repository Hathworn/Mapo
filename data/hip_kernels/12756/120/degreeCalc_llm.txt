```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for vertexArray to improve bandwidth.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing bank conflicts.
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for faster reduction.
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads if threads are guaranteed not to diverge.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if applicable to indicate non-overlapping memory.
