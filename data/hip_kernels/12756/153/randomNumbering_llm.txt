```
// Consider coalesced access to globalState for better memory throughput
// Preload globalState[i] into a register to minimize repeated accesses
// Move hiprandState initialization outside the main loop if possible
// Consider using shared memory if the kernel reuses the same random numbers
// Ensure that accesses to degreeCount are aligned for better performance
