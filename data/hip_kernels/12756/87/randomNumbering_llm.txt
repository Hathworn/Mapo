```
// Restructure memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes for optimal performance.
// Consider moving hiprandState update operations to reduce memory access and improve locality.
// Minimize conditional logic within the warp to prevent divergence and enhance efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory to cache repetitive data accesses, reducing global memory bandwidth usage.
