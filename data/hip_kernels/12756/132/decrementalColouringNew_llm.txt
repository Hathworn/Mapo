```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve throughput.
// Consider using shared memory for repeated data access to reduce global memory loads.
// Implement warp-level primitives to avoid divergence and improve loop efficiency.
// Align data structures to minimize padding and optimize memory access.
