```
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Use shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data by threads can be leveraged.
// Minimize global memory reads by storing frequently accessed data in registers.
// Consider using thread blocks and warps efficiently to ensure memory coalescing.
// Avoid excessive type conversions to improve performance.
