```
// Ensure coalesced accesses to vertexArray and neighbourArray for better memory performance
// Consider padding data structures to improve memory access patterns
// Explore shared memory usage to reduce global memory accesses in the kernel
// Minimize branching by simplifying conditional statements
// Utilize warp-level operations for potential efficiency gains
