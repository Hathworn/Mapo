```
// Avoid memory divergence by coalesced memory access in vertexArray
// Use shared memory to store vertexArray segments for quick access
// Minimize memory traffic by reading vertexArray[i] and vertexArray[i + 1] together
// Consider prefetching vertexArray data to L2 cache
// Use loop unrolling for atomic operations if inside a loop
