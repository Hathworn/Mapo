// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use coalesced access patterns by adjusting array indexing to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for the neighbor processing loop to reduce overhead.
// Ensure memory alignment for the vertexArray and neighbourArray for optimal access speed.
// Investigate the use of atomic operations for data consistency if needed in concurrent environments.
