// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts
// Use shared memory where possible for data reuse
// Consider loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better efficiency
// Pay attention to warp divergence to enhance execution speed
// Evaluate the benefit of using constant memory
