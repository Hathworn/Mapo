```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing vertexArray sequentially
// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance in accessing neighbourArray
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for vertexArray if reused often
// Optimize atomic operation for sum by reducing the number of atomicAdd calls
