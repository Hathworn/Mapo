```
// Consider using a larger __shared__ memory for accumulating more elements
// Reduce global memory access by utilizing __shared__ memory effectively
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory wherever possible
// Minimize use of atomic operations to avoid performance bottlenecks
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for GPU occupancy
// Verify alignment of memory accesses for improved efficiency
