```
// Consider coalesced memory access for vertexArray and neighbourArray
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize use of atomic operations to improve performance
// Apply loop unrolling for the for-loop to enhance throughput
// Align memory access to prevent bank conflicts
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy
