```
// Use shared memory to cache state data if multiple accesses are needed
// Consider cooperative groups for better thread synchronization
// Minimize divergence by ensuring consistent control paths
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy
// Align data structures to 128-byte boundaries for improved memory access efficiency
// Use __restrict__ keyword to improve compiler optimization
