// Consider reducing global memory accesses by caching frequently used data in registers.
// Shared memory can be used to store random states to minimize global memory access.
// Synchronize threads within a block using __syncthreads() after updating shared memory.
// Pre-calculate scale factors for common expressions to reduce redundant computation.
