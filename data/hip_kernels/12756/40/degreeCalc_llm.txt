```
// Use shared memory to cache data reused by threads in a block
// Coalesce global memory accesses for vertexArray and neighbourArray
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better parallel execution
// Avoid excessive divergence by ensuring uniform control flow
// Minimize global memory accesses by utilizing registers
```
