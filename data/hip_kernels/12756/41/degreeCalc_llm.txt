```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced loads from 'array' into local variables.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Ensure memory alignment for 'sharedSum' for optimal shared memory performance.
// Use __shfl_down_sync for reduction across warp to reduce the need for shared memory.
// Reduce atomic operations in 'degreeCalc' by accumulating results in registers.
// Prefetch 'vertexArray' and 'neighbourArray' data into registers for reduced memory latency.
