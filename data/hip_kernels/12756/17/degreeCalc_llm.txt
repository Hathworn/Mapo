```
// Use shared memory to store partial results for efficient data access
// Avoid race conditions by using atomic operations for critical sections
// Use a grid-stride loop for more efficient iteration over data
// Reduce redundant calculations by computing start and stop only once outside the loop
// Consider vectorized loads and stores if possible for coalesced memory accesses
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for all threads within the warp
