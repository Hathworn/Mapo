```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate memory alignment for hiprandState to speed up memory transactions.
// Use shared memory or registers for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize bank conflicts to improve parallel execution efficiency when accessing shared memory.
