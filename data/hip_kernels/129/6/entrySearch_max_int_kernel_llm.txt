```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to optimize memory accesses
// Ensure data is 128-byte aligned in global memory to maximize memory coalescing
// Use asynchronous copy to load data from global memory to shared memory to hide latency
// Tune block size and shared memory size based on specific GPU architecture to improve occupancy
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory access patterns are optimized
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives to further optimize the reduction step
