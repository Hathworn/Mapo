// Use shared memory wisely to cache data and minimize global memory access.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for improved memory throughput.
// Fine-tune block and grid sizes to maximize GPU utilization and minimize warp divergence.
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to improve compiler optimizations.
