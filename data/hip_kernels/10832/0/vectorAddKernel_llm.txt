// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Consider using shared memory if accessing data repeatedly
// Ensure proper use of registers by optimizing data usage
// Use vectorized loads and stores for improved memory throughput
// Employ warp- and thread-level synchronization carefully to minimize latency
// Optimize block and thread configuration based on the hardware constraints
