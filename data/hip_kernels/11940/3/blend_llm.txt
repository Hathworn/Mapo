```
// Avoid conditional branching by using ternary operations for better performance
// Precompute index calculations to reduce redundant operations and enhance memory access efficiency
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Ensure using shared memory if applicable to minimize global memory access latency
```
