```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize data fetching.
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory where possible.
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data that benefits from caching.
// Check for redundant calculations and move them outside of the kernel if possible.
