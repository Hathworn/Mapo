```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize thread block size to improve occupancy and memory coalescing.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction throughput.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce latency.
// Consider using read-only cache for constant data.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal bandwidth.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
