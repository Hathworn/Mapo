// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Avoid unnecessary use of __syncthreads() if the memory operations among threads do not require synchronization.
// Utilize shared memory for reduction operations to minimize global memory access.
// Optimize the loop unrolling further by explicitly unrolling small loops to reduce loop overhead.
