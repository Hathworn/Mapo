// Use coalesced memory access for arrays a, b, and c to improve memory throughput
// Consider aligning shared memory access to the warp size for better performance
// Evaluate if reducing memory bank conflicts can further enhance shared memory performance
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and utilize GPU resources efficiently
