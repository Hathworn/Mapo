```
// Use shared memory to cache d_kernel for faster access
// Optimize data access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce branch overhead within convolution function
// Prefetch d_matrix into registers to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Check memory alignment for better coalesced reads and writes
