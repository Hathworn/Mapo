// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve access speed.
// Optimize memory access by using coalesced memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of loop control instructions.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced and aligned to improve throughput.
// Prefetch data to registers before use to minimize memory latency.
