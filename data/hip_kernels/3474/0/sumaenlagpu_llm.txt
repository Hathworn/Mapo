```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if applicable
// Use __restrict__ to indicate that pointer arguments do not alias
// Opt for coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts within shared memory by ensuring appropriate data alignment
// Evaluate effects of varying block and grid sizes to find optimal configuration
// Profile the kernel using profilers to identify other potential bottlenecks
