```
// Consider using shared memory if array elements are frequently accessed by multiple threads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structure and access patterns.
// Avoid bank conflicts by structuring memory accesses properly.
// Use loop unrolling if computation within the loop allows for it, to decrease loop overhead.
// Optimize block size based on target GPU architecture for improved occupancy.
