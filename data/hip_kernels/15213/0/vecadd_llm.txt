// Use shared memory to improve memory access patterns for vector elements
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing for vector operations
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ keyword for pointers to avoid unnecessary memory loads
// Analyze if loop unrolling can be beneficial for this operation
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are properly configured for optimal occupancy
