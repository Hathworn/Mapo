// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access  
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data  
// Optimize occupancy by adjusting block and grid size  
// Apply loop unrolling if possible for better performance  
// Align memory access to improve coalescing  
// Ensure data is properly aligned in memory for efficient access  
// Minimize thread divergence by organizing data access patterns
