// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed matrix elements if possible.  
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to reduce global memory accesses.  
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization.  
// Minimize conditional statements inside kernel for better warp execution efficiency.  
// Align data structures to natural boundaries to facilitate efficient memory load/store operations.  
// Experiment with thread/block dimensions to maximize occupancy and performance.
