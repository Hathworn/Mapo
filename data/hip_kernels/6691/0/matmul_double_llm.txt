```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency
// Split work among threads to maximize parallelism
// Ensure coalesced memory access in loading elements into shared memory
// Use boundary checks to avoid out-of-bounds global memory access
// Synchronize threads after loading data to shared memory to ensure all data is available
// Write results to global memory only after all calculations are complete
