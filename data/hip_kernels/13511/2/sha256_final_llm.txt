```
// Consider using shared memory to store data and avoid frequent global memory access
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for data loading and storage
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data like constants
// Re-examine memory-bound sections for potential warp-level optimizations
// Investigate reducing register pressure by optimizing local variable usage
