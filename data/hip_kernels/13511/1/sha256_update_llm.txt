```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to optimize data movement.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance.
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed constants.
// Employ loop unrolling carefully to balance between code size and execution speed.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory and optimize accordingly.
// Explore using smaller thread blocks to minimize register pressure.
