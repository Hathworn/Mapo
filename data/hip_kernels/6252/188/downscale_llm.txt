// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring the global memory access pattern is sequential
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting the memory layout if necessary
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for writes back to global memory
