// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a contiguous manner.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Try reducing global memory access by minimizing redundant calculations.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations for shared or global data access when necessary.
