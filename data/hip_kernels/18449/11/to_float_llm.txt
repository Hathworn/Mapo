```
// Unroll loop to process elements in chunks for better memory throughput
// Use intrinsic for integer to float conversion
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous memory locations are accessed
// Use shared memory if possible to cache frequently accessed data
// Ensure enough threads and blocks to fully utilize the GPU hardware resources
