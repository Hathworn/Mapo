```
// Use shared memory for better memory coalescing and reducing global memory access latency
// Load entire working set into shared memory before processing to optimize reads
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory before use
// Exit loop early when condition is met to reduce unnecessary computations
