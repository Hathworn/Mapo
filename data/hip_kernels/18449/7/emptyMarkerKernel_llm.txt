```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers if pointers are used in future kernel functions to improve memory access performance.
// Optimize data layout in structures for coalesced memory access by grouping frequently accessed data.
// Attempt to minimize global memory accesses and prioritize shared memory usage where applicable.
// Employ loop unrolling techniques if applicable to reduce instruction overhead in future kernel functions.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding data structures appropriately.
