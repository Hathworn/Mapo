// Use shared memory to store intermediate results if necessary 
// Consider using fewer trials per thread to reduce computational load per kernel 
// Align memory accesses to improve memory performance 
// Use cooperative groups if possible for better thread synchronization 
// Optimize thread and block allocation for improved occupancy 
// Use pinned memory for faster host-device data transfers
