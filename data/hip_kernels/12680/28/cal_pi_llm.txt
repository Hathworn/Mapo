```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when writing results to global memory for better performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by adjusting block size and number of registers used.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by using padding if necessary.
// Profile the kernel to identify memory bandwidth usage and adjust the memory access pattern accordingly.
