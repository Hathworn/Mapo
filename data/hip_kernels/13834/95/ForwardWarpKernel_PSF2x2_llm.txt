// Utilize shared memory to reduce frequent global memory access
// Ensure tx, ty are within bounds before accessing shared memory
// Consider using __global__ variables to minimize atomic operations
// Evaluate use of atomic operations for potential optimization in memory access
// Initialize shared memory outside the kernel to minimize synchronization overhead
