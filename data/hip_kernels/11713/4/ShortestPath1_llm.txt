```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory to store Arr1 data that is repeatedly accessed by threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for Arr1 and Arr2 pointers to enhance compiler optimization by indicating no aliasing.
// Ensure the compiler can unroll the loop for better performance by providing possible unroll hints.
