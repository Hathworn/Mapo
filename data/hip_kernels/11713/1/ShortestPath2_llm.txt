```
// Consider coalescing global memory reads to improve memory throughput.
// Use vectorized loading if possible, especially when CELLS_PER_THREAD is more than 1.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing shared memory footprint if possible.
// Prefetch data from global to shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Ensure shared memory usage fits within the capacity, otherwise adjust BLOCKSIZE or CELLS_PER_THREAD.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
