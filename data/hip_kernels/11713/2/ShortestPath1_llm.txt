```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Leverage shared memory more effectively to minimize global memory accesses.
// Avoid redundant loads from global memory by storing frequently accessed data in registers.
// Use loop unrolling to increase arithmetic intensity and reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal access speed.
