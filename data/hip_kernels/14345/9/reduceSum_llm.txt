```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory addresses
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized and within limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Use warp-level primitives for the final stages of reduction to reduce synchronization overhead
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
// Ensure that `ncols` is divisible by `blockDim.x` for optimal work distribution
