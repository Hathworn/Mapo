```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure that idata accesses have stride-1 to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate the use of warp-synchronous programming to optimize shared memory usage.
// Align shared memory size to a multiple of the warp size (e.g., 32) for optimization.
// Consider minimizing shared memory usage if register pressure is not a limiting factor.
