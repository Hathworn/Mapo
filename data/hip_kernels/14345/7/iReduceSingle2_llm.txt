// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns
// Balance workload across threads for optimal utilization
// Employ loop unrolling to enhance data fetch efficiency and parallelism
// Leverage shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Minimize warp divergence during reduction phase for efficiency
// Consider reducing synchronization overhead by using warp-level primitives
