// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency during reduction.
// Consider using atomic operations if multiple warps are writing to the same global memory location.
// Ensure loop unrolling is optimized for specific hardware and thread count to maximize performance.
