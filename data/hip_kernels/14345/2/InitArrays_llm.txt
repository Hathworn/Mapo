```
// Align memory allocations to improve coalesced memory access.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize the calculation of blockOffset to prevent redundant computations.
// Evaluate whether merging the if conditions can reduce thread divergence.
// Use constant or texture memory for frequently accessed constants like SETLOC.
