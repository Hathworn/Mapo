// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for improved global memory throughput.
// Optimize the calculation by minimizing thread divergence.
// Ensure the alignment of float2 memory access for better memory performance.
