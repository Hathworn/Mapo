```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for matrix elements.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize bandwidth.
// Pre-fetch data into local variables to hide global memory latency.
// Explore loop unrolling for potential performance improvement.
// Ensure enough thread blocks to fully utilize the GPU.
