// Avoid branch divergence by removing 'if (idx == 0) continue;' statement
// Use shared memory effectively for coalesced memory accesses
// Consider increasing the block size to utilize more shared memory
// Ensure data alignment for float2 load/store operations for efficiency
// Implement loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase performance
