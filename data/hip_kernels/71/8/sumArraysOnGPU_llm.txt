```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring A, B, and C arrays are aligned.
// Use shared memory to store data blocks if operations are more complex.
// Optimize block size to achieve full utilization of GPU resources.
// Use float4 operations if memory bandwidth is a bottleneck and data alignment allows.
// Ensure data is on the GPU memory before kernel execution to reduce data transfer time.
// Use asynchronous memory operations if data dependencies allow.
