```c
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need to access data
// Ensure memory coalescing when accessing global memory
// Minimize divergence by avoiding conditional statements within the kernel
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring data alignment
// Analyze the possibility of loop unrolling if loops are present
// Use constant memory for values that remain unchanged
// Assess the use of registers for frequently accessed variables
