// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data in a linear fashion
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads use the same data
// Minimize memory access by avoiding unnecessary global memory reads
// Use efficient memory access patterns to improve cache utilization
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for better performance
