// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency  
// Optimize warp-level computations to reduce divergence  
// Prefetch data into shared memory to improve memory coalescing  
// Avoid excessive synchronization to reduce overhead  
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for global memory reads and writes
