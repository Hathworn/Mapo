```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for better performance.
// Use compiler-specific pragmas or attributes to optimize math operations.
