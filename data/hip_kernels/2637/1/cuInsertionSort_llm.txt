// Consider using shared memory for p_dist and p_ind to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Explore using warp-level synchronization to improve loop efficiency.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit by reducing branching and overhead.
