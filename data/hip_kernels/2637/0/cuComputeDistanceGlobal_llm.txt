```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for A and B loading.
// Use float4 or similar vector loads to reduce memory transactions.
// Minimize use of shared memory for cases where global memory can be accessed efficiently.
// Reevaluate the boundary checks to minimize conditionals within the inner loop.
// Ensure no bank conflicts occur in shared memory access.
// Consider computing in registers to reduce shared memory usage.
// Move invariants out of the loop to optimize execution.
