```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by having threads access sequential floats in dz_in
// Consider using shared memory to accumulate sum locally before writing back to dB
// Optimize for memory bandwidth by minimizing the number of global memory writes
// Utilize warp-level primitives to further optimize accumulation within a warp
