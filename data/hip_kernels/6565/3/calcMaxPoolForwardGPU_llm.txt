```
// Consider using shared memory to buffer input tiles for better memory access patterns.
// Use float4 or similar types for vectorized loads/stores to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy while considering registers and shared memory limits.
// Unroll inner loops (j, i) to reduce loop overhead and increase ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Align data access on float4 boundaries to improve memory coalescing.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on pointer arguments to allow compiler optimizations.
