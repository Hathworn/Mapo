// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Precompute input stride outside loops to reduce calculations within the kernel
// Use unroll pragma to improve performance of loops over classes
// Minimize repeated global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in local variables
// Improve memory access patterns by using linear indices for reading/writing data
