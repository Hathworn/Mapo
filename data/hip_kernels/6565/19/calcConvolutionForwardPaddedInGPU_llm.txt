```cpp
// Use shared memory to improve memory access speed if applicable.
// Evaluate coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory throughput.
// Consider data prefetching if memory access latency affects performance.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance.
// Ensure memory alignment to prevent memory access penalties.
