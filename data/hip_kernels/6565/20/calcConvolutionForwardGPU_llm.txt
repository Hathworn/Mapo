```
// Use shared memory to cache filter data for faster access
// Coalesce global memory accesses for padded_in to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure out is written in a coalesced manner for optimal memory write performance
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loops to reduce overhead and improve performance
// Minimize divergence by aligning thread calculations with control logic
// Use texture memory or constant memory for filter data if reuse within the block is high
