```
// Consider utilizing shared memory to load data, reducing redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for both input and output arrays to maximize throughput.
// If applicable, use float4 or larger data types for vectorized operations to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Minimize divergent branching to maintain high warp efficiency.
// Assess whether adjusting the block size could better utilize the GPU resources.
