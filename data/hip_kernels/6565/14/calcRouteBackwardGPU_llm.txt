```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using stride properly
// Use shared memory if there are shared values among threads for better cache usage
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop trip count is known and small
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize memory transaction overhead
// Check bank conflicts in shared memory and resolve them
// Use vectorized memory operations if possible
```
