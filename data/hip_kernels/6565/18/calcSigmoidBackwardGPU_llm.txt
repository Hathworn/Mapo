```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory addresses.
// Use __restrict__ to give the compiler hints about non-aliasing pointers for possible optimizations.
// Optimize by minimizing the use of global memory and maximizing the use of shared memory if possible.
// Ensure the kernel is launched with an appropriate number of threads to fully utilize the GPU.
