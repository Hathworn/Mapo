```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory load for repeated reads of 'in' values
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for 'dz' and 'dz_in' to improve bandwidth usage
// Unroll loops where possible to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Use constant memory for fixed parameters like 'max_bounding_boxes' and 'max_classes' to reduce register usage
// Minimize divergent branching to maintain warp efficiency
