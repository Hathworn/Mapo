// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory for commonly accessed arrays.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Unroll inner loops further to reduce loop overhead and improve ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce latency in memory accesses.
