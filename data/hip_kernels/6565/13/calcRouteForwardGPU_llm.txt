```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Consider using vectorized memory access for coalesced reads/writes
// Optimize bank conflicts in shared memory operations if shared memory is utilized
// Ensure optimal block size to maximize occupancy
