```
// Use dynamic shared memory allocation efficiently to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize by removing the offset variable and using stride with index directly for better memory access patterns.
// Read max with blockIdx.x to minimize unnecessary global memory fetches.
// Perform reduction using shared memory with stride to optimize memory access and reduce latency.
// Use atomic operations for writing the result to global memory to ensure data consistency.
