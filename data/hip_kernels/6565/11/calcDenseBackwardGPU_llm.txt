// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring global memory accesses are contiguous.
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to improve performance.
// Ensure that input data is aligned and fits into a single transaction when possible.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
