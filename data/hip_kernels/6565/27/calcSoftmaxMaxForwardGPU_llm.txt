```
// Consider optimizing memory accesses by using coalesced access patterns.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure that the cache array usage is efficient by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Consider leveraging warp-level primitives for reductions to optimize synchronization and computation.
// Fine-tune block and grid dimensions based on the architecture for optimal performance.
