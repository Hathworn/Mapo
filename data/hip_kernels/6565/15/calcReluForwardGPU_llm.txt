// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access nearby memory locations
// Ensure appropriate memory alignment for optimal coalesced memory access
// Minimize conditional statements inside loops to enhance parallel execution
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block and grid size for maximum performance
