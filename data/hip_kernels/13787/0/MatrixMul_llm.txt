```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Use shared memory to hold tile data for A_d and B_d for more efficient reuse
// Reduce global memory accesses by using local variables inside loops
// Ensure enough registers are available to accommodate the increased register usage
// Experiment with different TILE_WIDTH values to maximize performance
// Align data structures to improve memory access speeds
