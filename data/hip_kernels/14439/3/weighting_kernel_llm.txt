// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Load weights into shared memory only once per block to minimize global memory transactions
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() after loading shared memory
// Optimize thread calculations by utilizing block indexing effectively
