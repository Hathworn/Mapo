```
// Consider using shared memory for common data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access for contiguous signals and weights for better performance
// Check if using texture memory can benefit read-only data like weights
// Use loop unrolling for signal processing to decrease thread divergence
// Evaluate using register tiling for better utilization of the GPU's resources
