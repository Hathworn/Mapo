```
// Consider increasing shared memory size or using dynamic shared memory for larger data
// Prefetch data into shared memory to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data to cache line size
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by accessing it in a structured way
// Use __ldg intrinsic for read-only data to benefit from GPU memory caches
// Use __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions after writing to shared memory
