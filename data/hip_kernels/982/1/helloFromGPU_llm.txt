// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved memory throughput
// Minimize warp divergence by checking conditions that apply to whole warps
// Utilize shared memory to decrease latency when accessing frequently used data
// Align data structures to natural boundaries to enhance performance
// Apply loop unrolling techniques when applicable for computational efficiency
