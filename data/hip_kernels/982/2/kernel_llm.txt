```
// Ensure data is aligned in memory to improve coalesced access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if possible
// Avoid thread divergence by structuring conditions efficiently
// Consider launching the kernel with optimal block size for occupancy
// Balance between grid and block dimensions to maximize parallelism
