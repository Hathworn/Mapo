```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Minimize global memory accesses by leveraging shared memory as much as possible
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() when using shared memory
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable for further performance gains
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access and optimize if necessary
