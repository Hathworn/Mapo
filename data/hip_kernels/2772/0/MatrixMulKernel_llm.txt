// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize boundary checks to reduce unnecessary computations
// Ensure __syncthreads() is correctly placed to synchronize threads before computation
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used after computation to prevent memory hazard
// Improve memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses with warp size
// Consider increasing TILE_WIDTH for better occupancy and to maximize shared memory utilization
