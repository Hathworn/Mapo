// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve execution speed
// Calculate baseIndex once per repeat loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Consider using shared memory if repeated access to data can be coalesced
// Ensure memory accesses are within bounds to prevent undefined behavior
