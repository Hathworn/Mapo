```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to improve memory access optimization.
// Ensure that data is aligned optimally for coalesced memory accesses.
// Check for warp divergence and consider reducing it if it impacts performance.
// Evaluate if loading biases into shared memory might improve data locality and performance.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques if processing is done inside loops for further optimization.
