// Use shared memory to store edge data for faster access
// Make sure to coalesce memory accesses to edgeArrayAux
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Optimize edge traversal by accessing consecutive edges in a single warp
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Reuse warpId calculation within loop to avoid redundant operations
