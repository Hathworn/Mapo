```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling further or vectorizing the input if the hardware allows
// Use __restrict__ keyword to indicate that pointers do not alias each other
// Prefetch data to shared memory before the loop for improved data locality
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce warp divergence and achieve better utilization
