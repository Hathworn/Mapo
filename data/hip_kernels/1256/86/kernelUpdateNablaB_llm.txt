```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring nabla_b and delta_nabla_b are coalesced.
// Consider using shared memory if there is data reuse within the block.
// Ensure global memory access patterns are sequential and avoid bank conflicts.
// Analyze if using float4 or other vectorized memory load/store can improve performance.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring the same execution path for all threads.
