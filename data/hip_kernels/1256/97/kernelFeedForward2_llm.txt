```
// Ensure memory coalescing by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefetch data into shared memory to leverage data reuse when possible
// Ensure proper alignment of data to maximize memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop iteration count is known and fixed
// Reduce the number of expensive mathematical operations if possible
// Ensure the number of threads per block is a multiple of the warp size for optimal performance
