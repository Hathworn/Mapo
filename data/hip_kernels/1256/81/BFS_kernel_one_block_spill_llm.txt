```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures for optimal cache usage.
// Investigate locality in memory access to reduce global memory latency.
// Minimize data transferred between global memory and registers by utilizing shared memory where possible.
// Explore using warp-level or block-level synchronization to optimize neighbor processing.
// Review atomic operations and reduce unnecessary atomic accesses to avoid performance bottlenecks.
// Use loop unrolling or other compiler optimizations to enhance throughput in neighbor iteration.
