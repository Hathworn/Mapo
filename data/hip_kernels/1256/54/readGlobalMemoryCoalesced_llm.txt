// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for improved bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to maximize occupancy and reduce memory divergence.
// Consider increasing thread count to better hide latency.
