```
// Use shared memory for weights and activations to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch weights or activations to registers for faster access in the loop
// Consider unrolling the loop to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Coalesce global memory accesses in zs to improve memory throughput
// Ensure that w_off and bound2 are optimized for memory alignment
