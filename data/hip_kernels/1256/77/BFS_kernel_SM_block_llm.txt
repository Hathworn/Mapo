```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring threads in a warp read contiguous memory locations.
// Optimize memory access patterns for `edgeArrayAux` and `edgeArray` to ensure efficient cache utilization.
// Ensure `atomicExch` and `atomicAdd` operations are minimized to reduce contention and improve parallelism.
// Use shared memory where possible to reduce redundant reads from global memory.
// Evaluate potential use of texture memory for read-only data structures to optimize bandwidth.
