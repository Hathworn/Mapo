// Load as much data as possible into shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize shared memory access among threads.
// Optimize global memory accesses by coalescing reads and writes whenever possible.
// Use atomic operations carefully to ensure data consistency while minimizing potential performance penalties.
