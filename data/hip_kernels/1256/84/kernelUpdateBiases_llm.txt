```
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing memory accesses
// Check if shared memory can be used for better memory bandwidth
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce divergence
// Ensure memory transactions are minimized for improved performance
// Profile the kernel to identify and eliminate memory bottlenecks
