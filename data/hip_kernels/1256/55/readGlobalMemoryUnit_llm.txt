```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure data is accessed in a coalesced manner to improve memory throughput
// Use the __restrict__ qualifier for data and output pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Experiment with different loop unroll factors based on hardware specifics
// Prefetch data to registers before entering the inner loop
