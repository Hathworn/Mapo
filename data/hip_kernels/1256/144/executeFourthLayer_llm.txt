```cpp
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Shared memory usage is already optimizing for Layer4_Neurons_GPU, ensure its size is within limit.
// Ensure atomicAdd is minimizing thread contention, consider alternative reduction strategies if possible.
// The barrier __syncthreads() is used correctly, ensure no unnecessary synchronization stalls occur.
// Optimize the tanh activation by ensuring coalesced memory writes to Layer5_Neurons_GPU.
