// Use coalesced memory access by assigning consecutive threads to consecutive memory locations
// Ensure grid and block sizes are optimized for GPU architecture to maximize occupancy
// Consider using shared memory if there's any scope for data reuse
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could provide performance benefits in this context
