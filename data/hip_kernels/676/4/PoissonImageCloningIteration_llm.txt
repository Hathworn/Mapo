```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Coalesce global memory accesses for `source` and `target` by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Optimize memory transactions by ensuring `fixed`, `mask`, `source`, and `target` are aligned to memory boundaries
// Minimize usage of branching by refactoring conditionals where possible
