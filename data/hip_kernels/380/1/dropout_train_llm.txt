// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data and outputPtr
// Consider using shared memory for reducing global memory traffic if applicable
// Optimize block size and grid size for better performance depending on GPU architecture
// Use warp-level operations if possible to optimize conditional logic
// Apply loop unrolling for further improvement in memory access patterns
