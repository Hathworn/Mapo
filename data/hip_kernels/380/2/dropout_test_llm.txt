// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure proper memory coalescing by aligning data accesses among threads
// Evaluate the possibility of using warp-level primitives for reduction operations if applicable
// Avoid bank conflicts by distributing data among shared memory banks correctly
// Check for opportunity to unroll loops to reduce control overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Explore the usage of appropriate memory hierarchy, such as constant memory, for static data
// Use asynchronous memory copy and compute overlap to hide latency
