```
// Consider using shared memory to load data_im in chunks to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by arranging data_col indexing to align with memory architecture
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditional statements
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy and performance
