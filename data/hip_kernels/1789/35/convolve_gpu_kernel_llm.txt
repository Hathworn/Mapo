// Use shared memory to load weights and input data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning global memory access for input and weights.
// Minimize conditional checks inside loops to reduce divergence and improve execution efficiency.
// Implement loop unrolling for filter dimension loops to reduce loop overhead.
