```
// Reduce shared memory usage by using warp-level memory operations.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring aligned memory loads.
// Utilize memory coalescing to improve global memory access patterns.
// Prefetch weights_shared to reduce redundant memory reads.
// Use atomic operations sparingly to prevent performance bottlenecks.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loops to enhance performance.
// Ensure memory access is contiguous to maximize bandwidth utilization.
