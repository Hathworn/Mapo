```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for weights to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for input and output arrays.
// Reduce bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Ensure optimal thread block size to maximize GPU occupancy.
// Use loop unrolling for iterating over filter dimensions.
