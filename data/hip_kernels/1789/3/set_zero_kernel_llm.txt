// Use coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory alignment to optimize memory transactions
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ pointers to inform the compiler about non-aliasing 
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring uniform branch paths within the warp
