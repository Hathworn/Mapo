```
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are set for coalesced memory access
// Consider shared memory for additional coalesced access benefits
// Reduce memory divergence by ensuring that array accesses are coalesced
// Align data structures to the memory transaction size
// Utilize memory padding to handle misalignment issues
// Consider using warp-level primitives or intrinsics for further optimization
// Use __restrict__ pointers if there are no overlapping memory accesses
