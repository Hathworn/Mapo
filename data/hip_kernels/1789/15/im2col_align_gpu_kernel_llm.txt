// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Prefetch input data into shared memory to increase memory coalescing.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced where possible for better performance.
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Minimize conditional checks inside the loops for improved efficiency.
// Use loop unrolling if possible to further reduce overheads in the ksize loops.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize kernel occupancy.
