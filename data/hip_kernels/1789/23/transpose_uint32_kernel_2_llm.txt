```
// Consider increasing the size of shared memory for larger data sets.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring alignment, use coalesced accesses.
// Use padding to avoid shared memory bank conflicts.
// Coalesce global reads by transposing in shared memory.
// Ensure all threads within a warp can read from shared memory simultaneously.
// Aim for shared memory access efficiency by utilizing w_align.
// Employ __syncthreads() to synchronize threads properly during memory operations.
// Minimize zeros padding by adjusting w_align to match access patterns.
