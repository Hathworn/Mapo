```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning input data read operations
// Minimize bank conflicts by adjusting thread access patterns
// Use shared memory if possible to buffer input values and reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize loop unrolling for the sum accumulation to enhance performance
// Ensure output write is coalesced to reduce global memory access time
