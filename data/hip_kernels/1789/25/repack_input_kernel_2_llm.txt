```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better bandwidth utilization.
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for reading input array if access pattern is suitable.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy.
// Ensure warp-aligned memory access to improve efficiency.
// Minimize divergence by aligning conditional checks.
// Strive to align memory to power-of-two boundaries to utilize padded accesses.
