```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads access sequential memory locations within a warp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper memory alignment
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce the loop overhead in computing in_index
// Optimize the thread block dimensions to ensure maximum GPU occupancy and minimize warp divergence
// Use prefetching techniques where applicable to hide memory latency
