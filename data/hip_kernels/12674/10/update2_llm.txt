```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to reduce pointer aliasing
// Leverage warp-level primitives such as __shfl_sync for cross-thread data sharing if applicable
// Utilize shared memory effectively for any array data reused within the block
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance
