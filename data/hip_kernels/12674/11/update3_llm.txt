```
// Load data into registers to reduce global memory accesses
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to minimize global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal memory throughput
// Exploit data locality by preferring register or shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency when feasible
