```
// Use shared memory to store tiles of A for improved memory access
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for d_x and d_grad
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner computation loop
// Use __syncthreads() after writing to shared memory to avoid race conditions
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
