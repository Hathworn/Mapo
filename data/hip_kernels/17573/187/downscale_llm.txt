```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory addresses.
// Use shared memory to cache repeated reads from global memory and reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure that all memory accesses are aligned for better performance.
// Minimize thread divergence by keeping branch conditions consistent across the warp.
