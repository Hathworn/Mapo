```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache data1, data2, and dm for better memory access efficiency
// Minimize costly global memory accesses by loading data into shared memory when possible
// Apply loop unrolling technique in the for loop to enhance performance
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns according to warp size
