```
// Consider coalesced memory access by adjusting data structures.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to increase cache efficiency.
// Ensure alignment for better memory access speed.
// Explore using vectorized types (e.g., float2) for complex data operations.
