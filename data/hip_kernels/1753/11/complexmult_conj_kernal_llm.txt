// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Use float2 data type to improve memory access efficiency
// Optimize thread indexing to minimize divergence
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses with float2 loads for optimal throughput
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data items to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
