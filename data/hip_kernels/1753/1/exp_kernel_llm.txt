```
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Ensure the grid size is a multiple of the warp size for efficient memory utilization
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if aliasing is not an issue
