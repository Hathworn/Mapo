```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for 'image' to improve memory access efficiency.
// Evaluate using shared memory for frequently accessed variables if appropriate.
// Ensure the 'bx' and 'tx' are within bounds to prevent illegal memory access.
// Explore using half-precision floats if precision permits and supported by hardware.
// Profile the kernel to identify and reduce potential warp divergence.
