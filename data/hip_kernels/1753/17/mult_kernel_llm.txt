```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data reuse.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to fully utilize the available hardware resources.
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize global memory latency.
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to enhance instruction throughput.
// Use constant memory for invariant data to decrease global memory bandwidth consumption.
