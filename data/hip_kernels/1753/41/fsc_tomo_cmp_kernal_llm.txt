// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for data1 and data2 to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate using shared memory to reduce global memory latency for frequently accessed data.
// Use loop unrolling within the for loop to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize the calculation of base_idx by refactoring the expression for improved efficiency.
// Minimize conditional checks within the loop to reduce divergent branching among threads.
