```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance.
// Coalesce global memory loads and stores to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Consider memory alignment to reduce memory access latency.
// Utilize warp-level primitives to optimize synchronization between threads.
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring the logic if possible.
// Ensure data in local registers is contiguous to leverage vectorized instructions.
