```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Ensure block size matches shared memory allocation to avoid overflow
// Consider optimizing grid and block dimensions for better occupancy
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access for faster execution
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads and prevent race conditions
