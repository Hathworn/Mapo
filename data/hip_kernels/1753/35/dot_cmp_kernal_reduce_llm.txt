// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns for better performance
// Avoid out of bounds memory access for safety and correctness
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve execution speed
// Apply warp unrolling techniques to handle last 32 threads efficiently
// Minimize synchronization overhead by reducing __syncthreads() usage where possible
// Consider using atomic operations if further concurrency optimizations are needed
