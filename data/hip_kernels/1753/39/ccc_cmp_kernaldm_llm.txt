// Use restrict keyword to improve compiler optimizations for pointer aliasing
// Use registers for accumulated values to reduce memory access
// Unroll loops to reduce branching and improve instruction throughput
// Optimize index calculation for memory coalescing
// Use conditional checks to prevent unnecessary calculations
// Ensure division by zero is avoided for robustness
// Use float constants to minimize type conversion overhead
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
