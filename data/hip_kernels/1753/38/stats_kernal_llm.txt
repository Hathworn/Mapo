// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve data throughput
// Minimize global memory accesses by utilizing shared memory efficiently
// Ensure that the loop unrolling is applied if beneficial for performance
// Try to reduce the number of index calculations in the loop for efficiency
// Ensure proper alignment in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
