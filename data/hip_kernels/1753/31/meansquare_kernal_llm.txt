// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve global memory read efficiency
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by proper indexing
// Consider using loop unrolling for the innermost loop for performance enhancement
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance
// Consider using atomic operations if the reduction pattern permits
