```
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory access
// Optimize thread block size to match warp size for better efficiency
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for accessing data
// Use asynchronous copy methods for memory transfers
// Minimize divergent branches within kernel
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for increased throughput
// Profile kernel execution to identify bottlenecks and optimize further
