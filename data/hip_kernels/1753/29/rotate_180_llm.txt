```
// Consider increasing the block size to improve performance through greater parallelization.
// Align data access within shared memory to improve coalesced memory access.
// Consider using vectorized data types like float2 or float4 for improved memory throughput.
// Ensure memory accesses within coalesced blocks are contiguous to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Verify that shared memory usage is optimal and does not exceed limits for larger grids.
