// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize global memory read
// Use efficient memory band alignment for shared memory access
// Minimize memory divergence by checking boundary conditions efficiently
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning memory correctly
// Utilize warp-centric loop unrolling for the reduction step
