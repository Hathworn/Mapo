```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns
// Implement loop unrolling for better latency hiding
// Sequential addressing in reduction can be improved with warp-level primitives
// Use warp intrinsics for divergence free reduction
// Ensure optimal use of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
