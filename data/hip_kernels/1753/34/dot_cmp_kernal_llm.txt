```
// Ensure sufficient shared memory allocation for partial sums
// Consider using loop unrolling for the reduction step
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by padding
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory latency
// Align data1 and data2 pointers to minimize misaligned accesses
// Use cooperative groups for better synchronization within the block
