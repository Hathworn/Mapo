// Ensure all memory access is coalesced by verifying DIST array alignment with warp size.
// Replace 'kw' index calculation with shared memory to reduce global memory load latency.
// Consider loop unrolling or using warp-level primitives for further optimization in DIST processing.
// Minimize conditional branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
