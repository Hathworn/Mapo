// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that global memory access patterns are sequential
// Optimize memory usage by utilizing shared memory if data reuse is possible within a block
// Reduce memory divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow similar execution paths
// Test different block sizes to determine the optimal configuration for the specific hardware
