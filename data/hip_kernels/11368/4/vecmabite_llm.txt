// Consider using shared memory for out[] if operations permit to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure optimal block size to maximize occupancy and reduce latency.
// Use coalesced memory access for in[] to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Investigate warp-level operations to potentially decrease the branch divergence.
