```
// Consider coalesced memory access by using adjacent threads accessing consecutive memory addresses.
// Use shared memory to store data accessed by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring logical checks, if possible.
// Use compiler flags to optimize for the specific GPU architecture.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to avoid misaligned memory accesses.
