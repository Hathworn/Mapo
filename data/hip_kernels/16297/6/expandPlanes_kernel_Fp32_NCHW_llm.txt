// Reduce global memory accesses by using shared memory.
// Use bitwise shifts for performance gains in calculations.
// Ensure correct access by using static_cast for shared memory.
// Efficiently retrieve values from shared memory for performance.
// Use bitwise operations to efficiently check set bits.
