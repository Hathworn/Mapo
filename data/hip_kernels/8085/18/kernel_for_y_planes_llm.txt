```
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing by ensuring sequential memory access
// Align memory accesses to the warp size to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Leverage shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory reads
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to ensure data consistency and avoid race conditions
// Explore using loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase performance
// Minimize divergent branches by grouping threads that execute the same instructions
// Evaluate the possibility of using atomic operations to remove the need for while loop validation
