```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the volume data by organizing data layout optimally
// Minimize divergent branches by reordering conditional checks if possible
// Consider using warp-level primitives for efficient synchronization and reduction operations
