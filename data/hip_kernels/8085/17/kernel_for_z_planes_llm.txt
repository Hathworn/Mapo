// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Reorganize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced accesses.
// Optimize loops by removing redundant calculations, such as reevaluating idxS each iteration.
// Consider using atomic operations if multiple threads may update the same memory location to prevent race conditions.
