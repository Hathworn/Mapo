```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for better global memory read efficiency
// Ensure that the input pointers align to 64 bytes for improved performance
// Explore using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could provide better throughput
// Minimize branching within the kernel for optimized warp execution
