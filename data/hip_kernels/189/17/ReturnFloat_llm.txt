```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning the number of threads to a multiple of the warp size.
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts.
// Add range checks to prevent out-of-bounds access in pIn memory.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Use memory access patterns that benefit from L2 cache.
