```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to reduce memory transactions
// Ensure memory alignment to improve access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access when possible
// Minimize use of atomic operations by restructuring algorithm or data access pattern
// Evaluate potential benefit of loop unrolling if applicable in surrounding code
```
