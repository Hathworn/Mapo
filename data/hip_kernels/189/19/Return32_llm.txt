```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth 
// Use loop unrolling if possible to reduce instruction overhead 
// Atomic operations might be unnecessary depending on data dependency
// Optimize shared memory usage to fit within hardware limits
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access
