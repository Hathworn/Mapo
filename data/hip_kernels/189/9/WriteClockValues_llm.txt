// Consider coalesced access to global memory for better memory throughput
// Ensure data is accessed in a coalesced manner when writing to completionTimes
// Ensure data is accessed in a coalesced manner when writing to threadIDs
// Evaluate whether using shared memory for intermediate storage could improve performance
// Analyze register usage to avoid potential register spilling affecting performance
