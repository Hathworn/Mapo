```
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in 'num'.
// Minimize atomic operations by reducing their usage within each warp, possibly using warp reduction techniques.
// Consider reducing the use of __syncthreads() to improve performance, ensuring no data races occur.
// Optimize shared memory usage by re-evaluating the size if block size is different from 32, adapting accordingly.
// When final reduction step is performed, use parallel reduction to enhance performance and scalability.
