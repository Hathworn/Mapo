// Consider coalescing memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data, reducing global memory bandwidth requirements.
// Optimize memory access by aligning data structures to improve access speed and reduce memory transaction overhead.
