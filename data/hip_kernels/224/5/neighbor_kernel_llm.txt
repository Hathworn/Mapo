```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve data throughput.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for target hardware.
// Check for memory alignment to avoid potential bank conflicts.
// Use shared memory if data reuse can be optimized in kernel.
// Analyze if using __restrict__ can help with compiler optimizations.
// Ensure that memory access patterns allow for optimal cache usage.
