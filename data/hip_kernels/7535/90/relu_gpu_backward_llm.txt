```
// Use loop unrolling and shared memory to improve memory access efficiency
// Load data to shared memory in a coalesced manner to reduce global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded their data before proceeding
// Consider increasing the block size if shared memory allows to enhance parallelism
