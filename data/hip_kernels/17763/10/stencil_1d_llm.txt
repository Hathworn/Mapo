// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Unroll the loop for improved performance by reducing control overhead.
// Pre-load halo elements into shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure thread synchronization to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency in shared memory.
