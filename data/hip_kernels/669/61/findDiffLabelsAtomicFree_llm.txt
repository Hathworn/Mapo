```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by striding data access in devDiff with threadIdx.x
// Minimize memory divergence by reducing the use of conditional updates to devClusters
// Utilize shared memory where possible to cache frequently accessed data like minDistance
// Reduce register pressure by optimizing loop and variable usage inside for-loop
// Investigate whether loading multiple element blocks from devDiff in one warp can improve performance
// Prefetch devDiff data for subsequent loop iterations to hide memory latency
// Avoid unnecessary computation by breaking loop early if condition guarantees minDistance will not update further
