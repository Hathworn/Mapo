```
// Use shared memory to store distances temporarily to improve memory access speed.
// Consider using float4 or float2 for coalesced memory access in distance calculations.
// Utilize __syncthreads() after shared memory write operations to ensure data consistency.
// Optimize data loading with aligned memory access if possible.
// Minimize the use of global memory writes by using atomic operations sparingly.
// Allocate enough registers and use them efficiently to store intermediate results.
// Avoid divergent branches to maximize warp execution efficiency.
