// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for devInput and devOutput
// Ensure proper use of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Check for optimal block size choice to maximize occupancy
// Examine the effect of different grid and block dimension settings on performance
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions
