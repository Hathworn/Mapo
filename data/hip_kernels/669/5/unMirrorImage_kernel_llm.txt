// Consider coalesced memory access for both devInput and devOutput to improve throughput.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to minimise misaligned memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses if possible.
// Investigate warp divergence and improve thread block execution efficiency.
