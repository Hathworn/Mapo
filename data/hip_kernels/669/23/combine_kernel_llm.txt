```c
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses to eliminate bank conflicts
// Use shared memory to store temporary results and reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve performance
// Prefetch input data into registers to reduce global memory latency
// Consider using float4 or other vectorized data types for memory operations to increase throughput
// Balance the workload across threads and blocks to optimize resource utilization
