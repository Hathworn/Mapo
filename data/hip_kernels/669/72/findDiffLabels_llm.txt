```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for devDiff
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for devDiff to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling for small nClusters for performance boost
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning diffPitchInFloats for better cache usage
// Minimize use of atomic operations by restructuring logic if possible
