```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve performance when accessing devInput and devOutput.
// Ensure proper synchronization and avoid warp divergence for threads with border checks.
// Utilize shared memory where possible to reduce repeated global memory accesses for devInput.
// Align data to avoid uncoalesced memory accesses and potential bank conflicts.
