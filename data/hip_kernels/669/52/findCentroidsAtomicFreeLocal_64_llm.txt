```
// Consider coalesced memory access for filter_responses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that filter_responses is accessed in a contiguous manner to benefit from coalesced memory access.
// Consider using shared memory if possible to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied to the pixel iteration for reduced loop overhead.
// Ensure that write operations to centroidMass and centroidCount avoid bank conflicts for optimal throughput.
