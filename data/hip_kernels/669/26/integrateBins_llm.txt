// Consider optimizing global memory access by using coalesced access patterns.
// Reduce shared memory initialization conditional checks to minimize branching.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of using a different data layout to avoid stride accesses.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the iteration over image rows to enhance performance.
// Investigate the possibility of prefetching data to minimize memory latency.
