```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and reduce latency
// Minimize atomic operations by accumulating results into shared memory first
// Make use of __syncthreads() effectively to synchronize threads within a block
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling for filter iterations to potentially improve performance
// Avoid unnecessary __syncthreads() calls to reduce thread synchronization overhead
