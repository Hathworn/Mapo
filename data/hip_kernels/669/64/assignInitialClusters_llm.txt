```cpp
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring uniform execution paths
// Perform memory accesses coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization
// Precompute reduction results to avoid redundant calculations
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Align data structures to fit memory coalescing patterns
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive computations with predictable results
// Optimize the use of registers and reduce register spillover
// Minimize synchronization by organizing work to reduce dependencies
```
