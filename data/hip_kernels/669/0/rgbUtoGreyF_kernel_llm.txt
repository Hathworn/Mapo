```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for frequently accessed data.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to avoid memory access penalties.
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
// Use constant memory for any read-only data to take advantage of cached memory.
