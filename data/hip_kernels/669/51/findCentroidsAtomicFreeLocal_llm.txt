```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for filter_responses.
// Use coalesced memory accesses when reading from and writing to global memory.
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for parallel reduction.
// Reduce the use of atomic operations by accumulating results in local variables.
