// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance  
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data  
// Reduce redundant memory reads by using local variables  
// Use pre-calculated indices to minimize calculations in kernel  
// Optimize thread execution for load balancing across blocks and warps
