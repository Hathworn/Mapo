```
// Load centroids into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use __shared__ memory to store centroids and reduce redundant reads
// Implement __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data
// Check nPixels condition to avoid out-of-bound memory access
// Use accumulant to reduce redundant calculations
// Consider maximizing the use of shared memory for efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
