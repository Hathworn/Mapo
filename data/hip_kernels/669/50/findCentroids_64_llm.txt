```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable compiler optimizations.
// Prefetch data to shared memory to improve memory access patterns.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by reducing contention through more efficient data access.
// Explore using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Assess potential warp divergence and optimize control flow to enhance performance.
// Optimize the loop structure to reduce redundant calculations and improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Monitor bank conflicts in shared memory accesses and adjust indexing to avoid them.
