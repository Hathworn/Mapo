```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and increase data reuse
// Ensure non-overlapping shared memory allocation
// Replace atomic operations with local aggregation to minimize contention
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before updating global memory
// Consider loop unrolling for reduced branch divergence
