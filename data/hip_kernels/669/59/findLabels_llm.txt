```
// Use shared memory for centroids to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider unrolling loops to improve instruction throughput.
// Use atomic operations for thread-safe updates to shared changes variable.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in contiguous patterns.
// Evaluate the usage of __syncthreads to ensure correct synchronization with minimal overhead.
// Optimize loading of centroids by minimizing redundant data transfer to shared memory.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for optimized reduction operations.
