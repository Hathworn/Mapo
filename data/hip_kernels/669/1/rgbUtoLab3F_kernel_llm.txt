```
// Use shared memory for loading rgbU tile-wise to reduce global memory accesses
// Combine calculations where possible to reduce the number of instructions
// Leverage vectorized operations if supported by the platform for color conversions
// Consider loop unrolling for any repetitive calculations within the kernel
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns
// Explore the use of __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to optimize memory reads
// Assess the possibility of using asynchronous memory transfers to hide latency
