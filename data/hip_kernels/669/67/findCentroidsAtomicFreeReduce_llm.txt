// Consider using warp-level reduction to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Utilize shared memory more effectively by aligning its size to the warp size for better data locality.
// Explore using more efficient memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Optimize global memory writes by ensuring coalesced access patterns to improve throughput.
