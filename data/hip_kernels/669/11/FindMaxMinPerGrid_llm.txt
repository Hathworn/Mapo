```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve caching efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory optimally by ensuring accesses are coalesced wherever possible.
// Atomic operations can create contention; explore warp-level primitives if appropriate.
// Verify if further unrolling of loops can reduce instruction overhead.
// Consider balancing grid dimensions for an even workload distribution.
// Investigate reducing p_nMaxLevel or optimizing mask shifting for conditional reductions.
