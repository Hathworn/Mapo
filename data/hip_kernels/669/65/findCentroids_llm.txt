```
// Consider using vectorized loads for responses to improve memory throughput.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce atomic operations for localMasses.
// Ensure proper memory coalescing when accessing cluster and responses arrays.
// Adjust block size for optimal occupancy based on register and shared memory usage.
// Evaluate using cooperative groups for better block-level synchronization.
