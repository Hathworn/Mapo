```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block size
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Optimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform control paths
// Consider double buffering if applicable to hide memory latency
