```cpp
// Use shared memory to improve access efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access to global memory
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths
// Optimize shared memory size to fit in faster memory cache
// Reduce synchronization usage to avoid performance bottlenecks
```
