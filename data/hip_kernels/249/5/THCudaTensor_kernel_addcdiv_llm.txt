```
// Consider optimizing memory access by ensuring src1 and src2 are accessed in a coalesced manner
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp take the same execution path
// Minimize register usage per thread to increase occupancy and allow more warps to run concurrently
