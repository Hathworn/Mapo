```
// Consider increasing the shared memory usage if buffer size needs adjustment based on block size
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access in global memory
// Reduce bank conflicts within shared memory by ensuring data alignment
// Explore using warp shuffle operations for faster reduction instead of shared memory
// Leverage asynchronous memory operations to overlap computation and memory transfer
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to maximize parallelism and resource utilization
