```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster memory access
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations
// Try to minimize divergence by aligning the warp paths
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only arrays
// Use a single register to store temporary variables whenever possible to reduce register pressure
