```
// Use strided memory access to improve parallelism and memory coalescing
// Consider using shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency
// Unroll loops where possible to increase performance through reduced branching
// Use __syncthreads() strategically to ensure proper synchronization between threads
// Align data structures in memory for better memory access patterns
