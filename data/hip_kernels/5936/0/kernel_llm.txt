```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Ensure appropriate use of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions
// Minimize conditional branching inside the kernel for performance benefits
// Evaluate use of vectorized operations to optimize data processing
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
