// Optimize memory access by ensuring data is coalesced
// Avoid shared memory bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
// Check alignment of memory access to maximize bandwidth usage
// Evaluate use of constant memory for data that doesn't change frequently
