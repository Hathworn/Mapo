```
// Use __restrict__ pointers to potentially enable compiler optimizations
// Ensure memory allocation is aligned for better memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within a block
// Evaluate if loop unrolling might benefit the kernel performance
// Profile memory access patterns to reduce redundant reads/writes
