```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread indices with memory layout
// Consider using shared memory to store layer1 values if reused across multiple operations
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing code that reduces condition checks
// Use warp-level primitives for efficient synchronization if threads within a warp share data
```
