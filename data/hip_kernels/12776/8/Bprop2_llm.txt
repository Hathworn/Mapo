```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for dsyn2 to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use a different memory access pattern for 'out' data to ensure all threads access contiguous memory
// Ensure shared memory is used optimally by checking if data fits within the allocated shared memory size
// Evaluate the usage of warp-level primitives to further enhance performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding if necessary
