```
// Consider tiling the computation for better cache usage
// Utilize coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth
// Reduce the use of atomic operations by leveraging warp reduction strategies
// Align shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts
// Avoids direct global memory writes by accumulating results in shared memory
