```
// Use shared memory to temporarily store results to reduce congestion in global memory
// Implement early exit strategy to minimize unnecessary computation for out-of-bounds threads
// Minimize atomic operations by having one thread commit shared memory changes to global memory
// Optimize memory access pattern to maximize coalesced memory transactions
