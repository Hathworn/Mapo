// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit the multiplication or addition operations.
// Assess the benefit of using float2 or vectorized operations for concurrent computations.
