```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Unroll loops if applicable to increase parallel efficiency
// Minimize warp divergence by optimizing conditional branches
// Use half precision if the precision is acceptable for the workload
```
