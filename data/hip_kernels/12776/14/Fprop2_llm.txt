```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure all threads have written to shared memory before proceeding
// Consider coalescing memory access to layer1 for better performance
// Optimize the use of shared memory for syn2 to further reduce global memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by adjusting data placement if needed
// Explore the possibility of loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism
