```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Analyze the use of the loop unrolling factor to ensure optimal number of operations per thread
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to enhance throughput
// Use memory prefetching strategies to hide memory latency
// Evaluate if a different thread block size might yield better performance
// Cache frequently accessed data in registers for faster access
