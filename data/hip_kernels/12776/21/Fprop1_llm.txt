// Consider optimizing global memory access by coalescing memory reads from 'in'
// Ensure that 'syn1' accesses are optimal and avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Minimize the use of atomic operations in 'layer1' updates to improve performance
// Explore increasing the shared memory size or changing its structure to accommodate larger data
