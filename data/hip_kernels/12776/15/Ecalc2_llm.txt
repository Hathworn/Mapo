// Ensure idx is within the bounds of the arrays to prevent out-of-bounds access
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring threads access memory in a contiguous manner
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if possible to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Unroll loops if applicable to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Consider using half precision if supported to reduce memory bandwidth and increase throughput
