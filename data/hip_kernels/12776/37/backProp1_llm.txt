```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Leverage __syncthreads to ensure all threads have loaded the necessary data to shared memory
// Unroll loops to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Precompute terms to avoid redundant calculations within the loop
// Use atomic operations cautiously, as they can introduce serialization
