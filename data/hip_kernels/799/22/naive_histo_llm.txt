```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure blocks are fully populated to increase occupancy.
// If BIN_COUNT exceeds shared memory size, consider looping over parts of BIN_COUNT.
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory accesses are aligned.
// Use enough blocks to ensure all data is processed even if data size isn't divisible by block size.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient reductions.
