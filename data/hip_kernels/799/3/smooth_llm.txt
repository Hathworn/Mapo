```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for v[] and v_new[]
// Check block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and performance
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to improve performance
// Ensure proper memory alignment to maximize throughput
