```c
// Use shared memory to store local tile data for d_g and d_b to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner for-loop to improve performance.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access for d_coordinates, d_r, d_b, and d_g.
// Prefetch subsequent coordinates data ahead of the loop to minimize global memory latency.
// Use texture memory for d_g and d_b if spatial locality is significant to improve cache-hit rate.
