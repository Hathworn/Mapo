```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loading global memory
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads calls for performance
// Consider loading multiple elements per thread for better bandwidth utilization
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce synchronization overhead in reduction
// Optimize shared memory access to reduce bank conflicts
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead in the reduction phase
