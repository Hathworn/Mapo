```
// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of d_input_cdf to reduce global memory accesses.
// Prefetch data for next iterations to hide memory latency and improve data locality.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses when loading input_value from d_input_cdf.
// Consider loop unrolling if the kernel is not memory bound to reduce instruction overhead.
