```
// Use __shfl_down_sync for warp-level reduction to avoid using shared memory
// Minimize shared memory usage by using local variables for reduction
// Use cooperative groups for efficient intra-warp communication
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning d_in access with warp boundaries
// Reduce __syncthreads usage by optimizing warp communication
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to further optimize performance
