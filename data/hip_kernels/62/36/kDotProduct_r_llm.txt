```
// Consider increasing the block size to improve memory coalescing
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Apply loop unrolling to minimize instruction overhead
// Optimize the reduction loop by minimizing the number of synchronization calls
// Align memory access patterns to leverage coalesced memory transactions
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions for reduction instead of shared memory
```
