// Consider increasing the block size to optimize the utilization of shared memory
// Use coalesced access patterns for loading data into sharedSrc
// Optimize loop to minimize divergence by ensuring warp-aligned access
// Adjust sharedSrc size based on the problem constraints and memory availability
// Consider using vectorized loads if possible to improve memory bandwidth usage
