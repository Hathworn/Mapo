```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Align data structures to improve coalesced memory access
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimal for the hardware
// Check for memory bank conflicts within shared memory, if used
// Leverage warp shuffle operations to avoid unnecessary memory accesses
```
