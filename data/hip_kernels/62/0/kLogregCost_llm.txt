```
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory to cache maxProbs and labels to reduce global memory reads
// Reduce the number of divergent branches by restructuring logic
// Consider loop unrolling for the loop iterating over numOut to enhance performance
// Minimize the use of expensive operations such as division in correct probability calculation
