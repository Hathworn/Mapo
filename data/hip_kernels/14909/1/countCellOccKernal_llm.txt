```
// Consider coalescing memory access to d_hashArray to reduce memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure d_cellOccArray is accessed efficiently; consider reordering or padding to prevent bank conflicts
// Minimize divergent branches to optimize control flow on the GPU
// Leverage shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data
// Adjust block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and ensure efficient use of computational resources
