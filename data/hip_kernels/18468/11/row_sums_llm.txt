```
// Consider coalesced memory access for global memory reads of A
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform workload distribution
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized and does not exceed limits
// Use const qualifier for A and sums to enable better compiler optimizations
// Explore the use of dynamic shared memory if the block size is flexible
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory for more efficient usage
