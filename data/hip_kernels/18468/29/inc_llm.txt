```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Utilize __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions
// Prefetch data to shared memory to enhance performance
// Minimizing global memory accesses per thread improves efficiency
// Align shared memory accesses for coalesced reads and writes
