// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data loads
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by proper indexing
// Unroll loops to improve performance and reduce instruction overhead
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if applicable
