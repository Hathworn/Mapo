```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure data is loaded into shared memory with boundary checks for safe access.
// Employ __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory.
// Reuse temp variable for accumulation to minimize register usage.
// Implement boundary checks in the main computation to prevent unnecessary calculations.
// Synchronize threads after computations to ensure correctness in subsequent iterations.
// Store results in global memory only if indices are within bounds to reduce invalid accesses.
