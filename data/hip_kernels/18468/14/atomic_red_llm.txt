```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Perform reduction in shared memory before a single thread writes back to global memory.
// Utilize warp-level primitives for efficient intra-warp communication and reduction.
// Align data accesses to benefit from coalesced memory access.
// Ensure out is bank conflict-free in shared memory to optimize atomic operations.
