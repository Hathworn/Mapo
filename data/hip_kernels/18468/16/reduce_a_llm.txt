```
// Consider allocating shared memory dynamically based on the block size to optimize memory usage
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data properly
// Use compiler flags to improve loop unrolling efficiency, if not done manually
// Test different block sizes to determine the optimal configuration for target hardware
