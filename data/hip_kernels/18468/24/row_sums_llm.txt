// Use shared memory for row data to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch row data to registers to improve access speed
// Align data accesses to natural boundaries for better memory coalescing
// Consider tuning block and grid sizes for optimal performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to allow compiler optimizations
