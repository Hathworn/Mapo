```
// Ensure proper thread block sizing for balanced workload distribution
// Optimize global memory access by utilizing shared memory for A and B matrices
// Minimize redundant global memory access by preloading data into registers where possible
// Experiment with loop unrolling for better pipeline utilization in the accumulation loop
// Assess performance impact of tuning ds and thread block dimensions
// Use the __restrict__ keyword on pointers to improve compiler optimization
