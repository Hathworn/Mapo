// Avoid using shared memory for small reductions to enhance performance
// Consider memory alignment to improve coalesced memory access
// Balance memory bandwidth utilization with compute efficiency
// Profile the memory access pattern to ensure optimal loading
// Minimize branch divergence in warp operations for efficiency
// Tune block size based on hardware specifics to balance occupancy and performance
