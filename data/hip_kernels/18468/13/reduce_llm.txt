```cpp
// Use __ldg() for reading gdata to utilize read-only cache
// Ensure that gdata is aligned to improve memory coalescing
// Consider increasing granularity of parallelism by processing multiple elements per thread
// Unroll the loop to reduce branching and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls to reduce synchronization overhead
// Utilize warp shuffle operations for reduction to avoid shared memory use
// Explore using half-floats for sdata if precision allows to reduce shared memory usage
