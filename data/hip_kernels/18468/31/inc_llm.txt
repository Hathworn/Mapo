```c
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure array is aligned to avoid memory access overhead.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Profile to ensure the memory access pattern is optimal for specific hardware.
