```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads for input and kernel arrays.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses within the thread block.
// Consider loop unrolling in the inner convolution loop for improved performance.
// Ensure shared memory allocation is appropriately sized to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize for warp divergence by aligning thread operations within warps.
