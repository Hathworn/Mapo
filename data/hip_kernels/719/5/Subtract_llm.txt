// Ensure data is coalesced by accessing global memory in contiguous blocks
// Avoid shared memory unless necessary as it can affect performance on newer GPUs
// Utilize warp-level primitives where possible for potential speedup
// Consider using texture memory if frequent global memory access is detected
