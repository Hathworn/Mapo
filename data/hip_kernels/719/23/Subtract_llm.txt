// Use shared memory to store data loaded from global memory for faster access
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations in a warp
// Consider loop unrolling if the data structure allows for it to minimize loop overhead
// Optimize data loading and storing by using texture memory or constant memory if appropriate
// Leverage occupancy calculator to determine optimal block and grid size for maximum performance
