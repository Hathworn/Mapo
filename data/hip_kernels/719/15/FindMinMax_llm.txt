// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by having threads access consecutive memory locations
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing the number of active data in shared memory
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce the need for __syncthreads()
