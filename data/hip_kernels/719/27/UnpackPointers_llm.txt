// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for reduction in global memory accesses.
// Optimize data access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses and improve performance.
// Reduce redundant calculations such as columnIndex calculation inside the loop for better efficiency.
// Use warp-synchronous programming to optimize the bit manipulation section for better parallel performance.
