```
// Precompute reused expressions to reduce the number of arithmetic operations.
// Reuse partial results to decrease redundant computations.
// Optimize condition checks by avoiding expensive operations.
// Use precomputed expressions to minimize redundant calculations.
// Reduce branch divergence in conditionals for better warp execution.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible.
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to minimize overhead.
// Avoid unaligned memory access to improve performance.
// Consider using texture memory for repeated memory access patterns.
