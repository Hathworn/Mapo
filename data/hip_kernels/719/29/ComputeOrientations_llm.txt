```cpp
// Consider using float4 or float2 types for coalesced memory access
// Preload Gaussian values to avoid recalculating each iteration
// Align memory accesses to maximize shared memory throughput
// Consider avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads complete shared operations before proceeding
// Use loop unrolling for the loop where gradient is calculated to improve performance
// Ensure atomicAdd does not introduce significant bottlenecks on histogram update
// Evaluate if atomic functions can be replaced with warp shuffle-based reduction for better performance
