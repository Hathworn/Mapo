// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory reads by using appropriate conditional logic to avoid unnecessary global memory access
// Consider avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory by proper alignment
// Minimize synchronization by restructuring data access patterns to avoid unnecessary __syncthreads()
