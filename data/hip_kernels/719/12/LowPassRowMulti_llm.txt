```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve global memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Unroll loops where possible to increase computational throughput
// Align shared memory usage to warp size for improved efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches to maintain warp execution efficiency
