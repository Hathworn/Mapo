```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to g_Data for improved performance.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
// Ensure access pattern of d_Ptrs promotes memory coalescing.
// Consider using vectorized memory accesses to g_Data if applicable.
// Investigate loop unrolling for the initialization of hist arrays.
// Ensure shared memory usage is efficiently partitioned among threads.
// Consider using float2 or float4 for gradient calculations to enhance performance.
// Evaluate the benefit of reducing __syncthreads() calls by restructuring code.
// Optimize the computation of atan2f and sqrtf for gradient calculation.
// Reduce branching by using warp-level primitives and intrinsic functions.
// Leverage atomic operations for histogram reduction if applicable.
// Consider using a parallel reduction tree for smoother histogram reduction.
// Evaluate the impact of alternative smoothing techniques for histograms.
// Explore warp shuffle operations to minimize shared memory usage.
