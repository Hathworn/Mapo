```
// Consider optimizing memory access by coalescing global memory reads.
// Evaluate if using texture memory for g_Data would improve cache usage.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by padding shared memory arrays if necessary.
// Reuse shared memory for overlapping read and computation phases to optimize space.
// Use warp-level intrinsics where applicable to further optimize reduction operations.
// Avoid frequent use of __syncthreads() by reorganizing the computation where possible.
