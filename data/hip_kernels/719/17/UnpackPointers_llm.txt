```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like 'minmax[y * w + x]' for reducing global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from 'minmax' and writing to 'ptrs' for improved performance.
// Evaluate the stride based on warp size or memory access patterns to optimize load balancing among threads.
