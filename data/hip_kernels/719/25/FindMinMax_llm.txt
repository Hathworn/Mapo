```cpp
// Use x instead of tx for boundary check to minimize warp divergence
// For unaligned memory access, manually setting memory should be handled efficiently
// Reduce loop iterations, use d >>= 1 for efficient block-wide reduction
// Consider using warp-level primitives for faster reductions
```
