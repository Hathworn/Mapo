```
// Ensure proper data alignment to prevent misaligned memory accesses.
// Experiment with different shared memory layouts to utilize bank conflicts.
// Further explore possibilities of loop unrolling to improve throughput.
// Consider using float4 or other vector types for coalesced memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory reads.
// Balance between shared memory usage and register pressure to avoid spills.
// Look into the potential of using async copy operations for better overlap.
