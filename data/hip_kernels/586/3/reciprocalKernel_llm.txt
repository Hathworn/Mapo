```
// Consider using shared memory for data that is accessed multiple times
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp efficiency
// Prefer using registers over shared or global memory for intermediate calculations
// Use const qualifier for parameters that are not modified within the kernel
