```cpp
// Ensure all global memory accesses are coalesced.
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage.
// Minimize register usage per thread for better occupancy.
// Evaluate the benefit of loop unrolling for arithmetic operations.
// Ensure integer arithmetic conversions do not cause overflow.
