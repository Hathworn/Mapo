// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data, optimizing access patterns.
// Minimize the number of accesses to global memory by reusing values in registers.
// Consider unrolling loops manually to enhance parallel threads' efficiency.
// Precompute shared values to reduce redundant computations within each thread block.
// Split warp execution paths to ensure uniform execution and reduce divergence.
