```cpp
// Consider coalesced global memory access to optimize memory throughput
// Use shared memory to cache RGB data to reduce read operations from global memory
// Optimize shared memory usage by aligning memory access patterns
// Minimize conditional statements within the kernel for performance
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of the warp size
