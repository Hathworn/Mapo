```
// Use shared memory to store variance and mean to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for input pointers to help the compiler with optimization
// Use loop unrolling for computations involving spatial or batch if applicable
// Align data accessed by threads to ensure coalesced memory access patterns
// Evaluate alternative memory access patterns to ensure better caching and locality
