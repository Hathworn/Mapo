```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for simultaneous reading of r, g, b.
// Ensure memory access for rand[] is coalesced where possible.
// Pre-fetch and cache random values for better memory locality and reduce latency.
// Optimize thread block size to ensure maximum occupancy considering hardware limits.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access for frequently used data computations.
