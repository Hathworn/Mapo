```cpp
// Combine pointer arithmetic calculations to reduce operations
// Utilize registers for repeating and frequently accessed values
// Unroll loops where possible to minimize instruction overhead
// Avoid redundant access to global memory by caching in registers
// Fuse operations to minimize instruction count and improve throughput
// Ensure data alignment and coalesced access when reading from global memory
```
