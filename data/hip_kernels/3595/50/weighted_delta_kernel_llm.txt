```
// Consider using shared memory to hold frequently accessed data such as 's' and 'dc' to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize conditional statements inside the loop to improve warp execution efficiency
// Use loop unrolling for better pipeline utilization if applicable based on the problem size
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better memory throughput
// Prefetch data for the next loop iteration to hide memory latency
