// Consider coalesced memory access for x and out arrays to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure that the memory accesses are aligned to minimize bank conflicts.
// Use shared memory if there is a potential reuse of data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize the thread block size to fit the GPU architecture for better utilization.
