```
// Consider using shared memory for coalesced access to data_col to improve memory access efficiency.
// Loop unrolling is already applied, further loop optimizations can be explored based on specific GPU architecture.
// Precompute constants outside nested loops to minimize redundant calculations.
// Optimize boundaries calculations to reduce branch divergence.
// Ensure efficient use of atomic operations or explore alternatives if contention is a bottleneck.
