```
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing for 'x' and 'out' array accesses
// Use shared memory for improved access patterns between threads
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better bandwidth utilization
// Prefer offset calculations to minimize complex modulo/division operations
// Utilize vectorized memory loads for 'x' and 'out' where applicable
// Align data access patterns to warp boundaries to reduce bank conflicts
