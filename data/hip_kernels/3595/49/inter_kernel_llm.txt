// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access.
// Use coalesced global memory access patterns for each thread to improve memory bandwidth.
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads.
// Profile the kernel to identify bottlenecks and adjust memory access patterns accordingly.
