```
// Use shared memory to reduce memory fetch latency for truth and pred arrays
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory to ensure consistency
// Ensure that memory access for shared memory is coalesced for better performance
// Opt for using logf for float precision and performance improvement
// Consider using atomics if global memory writes need synchronization
