// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate sums for faster access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Ensure variance[i] is loaded once and reused within the thread for efficiency
// Minimize thread divergence by restructuring loops or conditions
