```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure all threads have synchronized after loading to shared memory
// Work with batches of data that fit into shared memory to reduce loading overhead
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth
// Ensure data loading to shared memory occurs with proper bounds checking
