// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for pred and truth arrays to improve bandwidth utilization
// Optimize block and grid size to maximize occupancy and minimize thread divergence
// Pre-compute common expressions outside of critical loops to minimize redundant calculations
