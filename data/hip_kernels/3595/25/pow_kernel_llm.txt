```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses for frequently used data
// Ensure INCX and INCY lead to coalesced accesses for better performance
// Minimize divergence by keeping threads within a warp executing the same path
// Tune block size and grid size for optimal use of GPU resources and occupancy
