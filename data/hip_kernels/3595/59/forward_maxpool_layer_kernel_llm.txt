```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by aligning data access patterns
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing frequently accessed data in shared memory
// Use loop unrolling to reduce overhead and improve throughput
// Avoid using infrequently accessed memory locations to reduce memory latency
// Replace mathematical expressions with precomputed values when possible
// Ensure consistent usage of thread and block indices for better predictability
