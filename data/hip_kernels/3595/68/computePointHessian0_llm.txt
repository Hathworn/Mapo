// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive accesses to dh_ang
// Utilize local variables for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access
// Consider coalescing memory access for x, y, z arrays to improve bandwidth utilization
// Explore using vector types for o_x_o_y_o_z to potentially enhance memory efficiency
// Leverage loop unrolling to optimize computational throughput within the loop
