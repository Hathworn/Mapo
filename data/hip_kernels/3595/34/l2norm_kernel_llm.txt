```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Consider loop unrolling for accessing filters to enhance throughput
// Use __syncthreads() if necessary to prevent race conditions between threads
// Optimize thread block size to maximize GPU occupancy
