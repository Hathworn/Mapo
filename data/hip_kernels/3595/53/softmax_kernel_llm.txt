```
// Consider reordering memory access to ensure coalesced memory operations
// Optimize kernel launch configuration for maximizing occupancy
// Use shared memory in blocks to reduce global memory access latency
// Avoid conditional statements inside loops for better warp execution efficiency
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
