```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory if multiple threads read the same data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that gauss_d2 is read from memory to registers once per kernel launch if constant
// Minimize divergent branches to keep all warps in the same execution path
