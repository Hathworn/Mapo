```
// Consider alignment of memory accesses for X array for coalesced memory access
// Ensure ALPHA is copied to local memory or register to minimize global memory access
// Utilize shared memory if threads within a block need to use common data
// Assess warp execution efficiency and consider loop unrolling if beneficial
