```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for delta and prev_delta.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Consider loop unrolling for the neighborhood area iteration to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced, especially in the inner loops.
// Consider using texture cache for read-only data accessed randomly like indexes.
