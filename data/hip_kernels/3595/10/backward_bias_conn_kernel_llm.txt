```cpp
// Use shared memory to store delta values within a block to reduce global memory access
// Implement loop unrolling for the batch loop to increase instruction throughput
// Consider adjusting the block size to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
// Ensure proper memory alignment for bias_updates and delta to improve memory access speed
// Evaluate using coalesced memory access to further optimize memory access patterns
