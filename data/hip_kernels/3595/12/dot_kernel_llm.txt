```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync to accelerate reduction instead of __syncthreads
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing the shared memory footprint and reusing shared memory space if possible
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by tailoring block size to maximize the number of active warps per multiprocessor
// Evaluate potential use of mixed precision or tensor cores if applicable to improve performance
