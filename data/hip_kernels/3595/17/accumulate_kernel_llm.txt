```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data locality
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring 'x[k * groups + i]' is accessed in a contiguous manner
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Use warp-level primitives to accumulate data within a warp before writing to global memory
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring aligned access patterns
