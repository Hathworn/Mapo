```cpp
// Unroll the first loop in softmax_device to enhance memory access efficiency.
// Combine overhead reduction with loop computation in the second loop.
// Merge normalization into the prior loop to eliminate an additional memory pass.
// Precompute indices outside loops in softmax_tree_kernel to decrease unnecessary computations.
