```
// Consider pre-loading trans_x, trans_y, trans_z into shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Store valid_points, starting_voxel_id, and voxel_id in shared memory to optimize memory access patterns.
// Use loop unrolling to increase computational efficiency where applicable.
// Minimize use of global memory by pre-loading centr_x, centr_y, centr_z into shared memory.
// Cache icov00 to icov22 in registers for faster repeated access.
// Use fewer registers by optimizing mathematical operations where feasible.
// Evaluate if atomic operations can be avoided to reduce computational overhead.
