```cpp
// Use shared memory to store partial sums for improved memory access speed
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and enhance pipeline efficiency
// Use __syncthreads to ensure all threads have completed updates to shared memory
// Perform reduction within the block to accumulate values in shared memory
```
