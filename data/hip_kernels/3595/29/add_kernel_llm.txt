// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure grid and block sizes are optimized to the target hardware for maximum occupancy.
// Leverage memory coalescing by ensuring that X[i*INCX] accesses are efficient across threads.
// Use asynchronous memory copy operations where appropriate to overlap computation and memory transfer.
