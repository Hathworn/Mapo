```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring pred, truth, delta, and error are accessed in coalesced manner.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads are working on overlapping data to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure n is a multiple of blockDim.x for optimal occupancy and workload distribution.
