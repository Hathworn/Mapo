```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by using a[i], b[i], and s[i] in contiguous memory regions.
// Ensure b is non-null before accessing its elements to prevent undefined behavior.
// Use shared memory if s[i] is reused multiple times for better latency hiding.
// Optimize grid and block configuration for maximum warp occupancy.
// Assess if the use of texture or constant memory could benefit s if it's a constant or frequently accessed.
