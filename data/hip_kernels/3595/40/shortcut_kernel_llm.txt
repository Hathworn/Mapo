// Consider coalescing memory accesses for 'out' and 'add' arrays to improve memory throughput
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Check whether loop unrolling could improve pipeline efficiency due to predictable loop bounds
// Ensure optimal block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy and hardware utilization
