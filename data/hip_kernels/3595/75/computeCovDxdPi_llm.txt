```
// Consider using shared memory for inverse_covariance to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that voxel_id is accessed in a coalesced manner
// Ensure starting_voxel_id is structured to enhance memory access patterns
// Profile and align cov_dxd_pi access to improve memory transaction efficiency
