```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory transactions
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize latency in memory access
// Ensure the usage of __restrict__ qualifier on pointers if applicable for better compiler optimization
// Adjust grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and resource utilization
