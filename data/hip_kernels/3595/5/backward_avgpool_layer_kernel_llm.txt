```
// Consider coalescing memory access for in_delta and out_delta to improve global memory bandwidth usage.
// Try using shared memory to cache values of out_delta if it is reused multiple times.
// Assess if loop unrolling can be applied for calculations within the kernel to enhance performance.
// Explore the possibility of launching the kernel with a different block size for optimal occupancy and resource utilization.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to 128 bytes to fully utilize memory transactions on GPU.
