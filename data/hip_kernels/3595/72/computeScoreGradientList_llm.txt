// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to improve cache utilization
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like centroid coordinates
// Use texture memory for read-only data like trans_x, trans_y, trans_z to improve bandwidth
// Coalesce memory accesses to global memory by ensuring threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize divergence within warps by restructuring conditional statements and loops
// Reduce redundant casting by storing trans_x, trans_y, trans_z as double once loaded
// Implement loop unrolling for the internal loop over the voxels to reduce loop overhead
