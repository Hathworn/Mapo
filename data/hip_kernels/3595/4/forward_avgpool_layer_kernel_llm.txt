```
// Consider using shared memory to store partial results from input.
// Reduce global memory access by using register memory for sum.
// Precompute h * w to avoid redundant calculations inside the loop.
// Optimize in_base_index by moving multiplication outside the loop.
// Explore using warp-level primitives for more efficient parallel reduction.
