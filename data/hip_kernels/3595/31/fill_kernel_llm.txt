// Use shared memory for data that is read by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using vectorized operations if possible to improve memory throughput.
// Use cooperative groups to simplify thread synchronization and optimize performance.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better memory efficiency.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable compiler optimizations.
