```c
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses in arrays
// Consider padding structures or aligning data to prevent bank conflicts
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Minimize arithmetic operations inside loops by precomputing invariant expressions
```
