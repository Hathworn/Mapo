```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Consider optimizing the strided loop for better cache utilization.
// Align data structures to facilitate memory coalescing.
