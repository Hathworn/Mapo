```cpp
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to load dh_ang with coalesced access
// Ensure shared memory is adequately utilized for small dh_ang data size (9 elements)
// Implement strided loop to efficiently process valid points and minimize bank conflicts
// Consider the use of vectorized loads if possible to enhance memory throughput
