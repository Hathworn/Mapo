// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Avoid warp divergence by minimizing branching within the kernel
// Consider using vectorized operations if applicable for better memory throughput
// Optimize the block and grid size based on the target architecture and data size
