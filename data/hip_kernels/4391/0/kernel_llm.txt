// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency  
// Optimize data synchronization using __syncthreads()   
// Consider if cooperative groups can be utilized for more efficient synchronization  
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits to prevent out-of-memory issues  
// Investigate if loop unrolling can improve performance in reduction operations  
// Profile the loop to identify potential bottlenecks
