```
// Consider increasing the size of shared memory if computation needs more space
// Optimize the use of shared memory by minimizing bank conflicts
// Align shared memory accesses to reduce memory access latency
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used correctly to avoid race conditions
// If possible, coalesce global memory writes to increase memory throughput
