```
// Use shared memory for better memory access patterns
// Consider using texture memory if access to arr is spatially coherent
// Coalesce memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Reduce divergence by ensuring thread execution paths are similar
// Use atomic operations cautiously to avoid performance bottlenecks
```
