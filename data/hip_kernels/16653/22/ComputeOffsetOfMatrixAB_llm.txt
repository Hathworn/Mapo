```
// Consider using shared memory to cache row_sum and col_sum for faster access
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by carefully aligning data
// Ensure coalesced memory access for output array writes
// Evaluate the warp size and block size for optimal occupancy
// Use __restrict__ more consistently for all pointers to improve compiler optimizations
