```c
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory reads from global memory
// Minimize memory latency by maximizing the arithmetic intensity within the loop
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using more blocks to better utilize the GPU resources
// Ensure enough work is assigned per thread to avoid underutilization
```
