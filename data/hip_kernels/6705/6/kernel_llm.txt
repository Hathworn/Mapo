```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized to reduce bank conflicts
// Consider optimizing the thread block size for better occupancy
// Use constant memory whenever possible for read-only data
