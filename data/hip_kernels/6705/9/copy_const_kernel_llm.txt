```
// Consider using shared memory for reusable data to further reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for both iptr and cptr arrays to improve throughput
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to hint at compiler optimizations for reducing memory latency
// Validate grid and block dimensions to ensure occupancy and warp execution efficiency are maximized
// Avoid conditional statements within kernels when possible to reduce divergence between threads
