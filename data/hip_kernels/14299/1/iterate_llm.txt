```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by coalescing reads/writes
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to minimize accesses to global memory
// Utilize memory bank conflicts handling when accessing shared memory
// Avoid conditional statements in compute-intensive sections for efficiency
// Check for alignment of memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Leverage warp-level programming to maximize efficiency in data processing
