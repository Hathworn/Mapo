```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads process consecutive matrix elements
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads follow similar execution paths
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for neighboring cells
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce repetitive global memory reads
// Use loop unrolling techniques where applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Align memory access patterns with warp boundaries for better memory access efficiency
