// Consider optimizing the memory access patterns to improve coalescing.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Align data structures to ensure memory accesses are aligned and efficient.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Minimize the usage of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Investigate using loop unrolling to enhance performance by reducing loop control overhead.
