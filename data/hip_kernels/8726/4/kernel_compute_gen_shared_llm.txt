// Ensure coalesced memory access by padding shared memory appropriately.
// Use __ldg for read-only data if possible to improve access speed.
// Consider using memory fences to minimize potential bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Optimize shared memory allocation to avoid excessive use of local memory and registers.
// Evaluate if double buffering technique could further optimize shared memory usage.
