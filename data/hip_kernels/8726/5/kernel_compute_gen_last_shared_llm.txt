```
// Strive to keep frequently accessed data in shared memory or registers to reduce global memory accesses.
// Utilize thread synchronization strategically to ensure shared memory data consistency before computation.
// Consider unrolling loops or using intrinsics to minimize the overhead of loop control, especially in neighbor computations.
// Leverage predication to conditionally compute only when needed to avoid unnecessary memory access and processing.
