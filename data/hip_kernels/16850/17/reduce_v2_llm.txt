```c
// Consider increasing the block size or using dynamic shared memory allocations
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring that all threads follow the same execution path
// Use __syncthreads() carefully to avoid unnecessary synchronization barriers
// Optimize shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring that accesses are ideally aligned
```
