```
// Consider using shared memory for repetitive data access to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure coalesced memory access for arr[ii * step - 1] and arr[ii * step - step / 2 - 1]
// Minimize warp divergence with single conditional checks
// Evaluate using faster arithmetic operations if applicable, like bitwise to replace division by 2
