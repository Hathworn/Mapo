```
// Increase TILE_SIZE if shared memory allows to improve data locality
// Ensure 2D coalesced memory accesses by using shared memory padding
// Initialize shared memory variables in a single statement to improve performance
// Use ceil to accurately determine the number of tiles needed
// Access global memory with stride pattern to ensure coalesced accesses
// Consider additional loop unrolling based on TILE_SIZE for further optimization
// Verify array bounds before accessing global memory to prevent out-of-bound errors
