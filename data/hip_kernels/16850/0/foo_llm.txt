// Consider using shared memory for caching if multiple threads use the same data
// Minimize global memory accesses by caching results locally
// Avoid recalculating frequently used expressions
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for data exchange between threads without shared memory
