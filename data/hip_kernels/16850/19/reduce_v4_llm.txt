```
// Ensure optimal memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize thread divergence by branching/blocking efficiently.
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate computations to reduce global memory access.
// Implement warp-level reduction efficiently to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Store the results in the global memory only after the reduction is completed.
