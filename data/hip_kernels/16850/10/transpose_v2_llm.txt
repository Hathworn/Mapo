```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for global memory
// Use aligned memory access to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Ensure data prefetching to hide memory latency
// Optimize the grid and block size for optimal occupancy
// Use double buffering to overlap computation with memory operations
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting data layout
// Perform boundary checks after loading data into registers
