// Optimize memory access by ensuring data is coalesced in global memory
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Minimize conditional checks within kernel to reduce divergence
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit performance depending on compiler optimization settings
// Double-check alignment and padding for input/output arrays to maximize memory throughput
