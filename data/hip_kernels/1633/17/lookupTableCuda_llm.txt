```
// Consider using shared memory for the lookup table to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes for improved performance.
// Utilize __restrict__ keyword for pointers if aliasing is not needed to enhance data access speed.
// Assess the benefit of using warp-level primitives to further optimize memory operations.
