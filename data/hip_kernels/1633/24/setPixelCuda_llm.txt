```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for pointX and pointY
// Optimize coalesced memory access by adjusting thread block size
// Add compiler directives for loop unrolling to improve performance
// Ensure memory alignment for variables to optimize memory access
// Consider using texture memory for read-only pixel data to improve caching
