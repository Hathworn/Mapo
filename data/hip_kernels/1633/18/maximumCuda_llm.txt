```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly
// Consider using vectorized data types for higher memory throughput
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal performance
// Minimize divergent branching for efficient warp execution
// Use __restrict__ keyword on pointers to enable additional compiler optimizations
