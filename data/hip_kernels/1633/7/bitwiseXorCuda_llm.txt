```c
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that all threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align data structures to reduce memory transaction costs.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for maximum occupancy and efficiency.
