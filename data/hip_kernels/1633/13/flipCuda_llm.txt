```
// Use shared memory for better memory access patterns
// Load input data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory is properly populated
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access if possible
