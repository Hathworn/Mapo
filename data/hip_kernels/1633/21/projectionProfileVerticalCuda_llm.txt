// Consider prefetching image data to shared memory to improve memory access efficiency
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to enhance global memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize atomic operations by reducing the number of atomic writes per block
// Balance the number of threads per block to optimize occupancy and resource usage
