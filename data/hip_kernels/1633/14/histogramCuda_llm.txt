// Consider optimizing data coalescing by ensuring data access patterns align with memory bank structure.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses and reduce bank conflicts.
// Leverage warp-synchronous programming to potentially reduce synchronization overhead.
// Consider a reduction strategy to minimize atomic operations within the block.
