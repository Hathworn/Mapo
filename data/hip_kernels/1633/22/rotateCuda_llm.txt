```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for input data.
// Consider using texture memory for better spatial locality and caching.
// Reduce the use of fine-grained synchronization for faster memory access.
// Adjust block size for optimum memory throughput and occupancy.
// Utilize constant memory for variables like rowSizeIn, rowSizeOut, cosAngle, sinAngle, inXStart, and inYStart.
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning memory accesses and improving coalescing.
// Prefetch data to reduce wait time for memory access in subsequent calculations.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for calculations involving probX and probY.
