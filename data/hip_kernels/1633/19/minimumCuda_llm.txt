```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures in memory
// Minimize divergent branches for increased warp efficiency
// Consider using shared memory for data that is reused by multiple threads
// Use appropriate block and grid size to maximize occupancy and resource utilization
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can provide a performance benefit in this context
