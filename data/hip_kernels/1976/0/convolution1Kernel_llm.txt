```c
// Use shared memory to load neighboring elements for better memory coalescing
// Prefetch required filter values into registers if possible to reduce repetitive access
// Minimize divergent branches and ensure memory accesses are coalesced
// Consider using constant memory for small fixed-size data like filter coefficients
```
