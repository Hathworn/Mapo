```
// Ensure shared memory utilization by loading B into shared memory to decrease global memory accesses
// Align shared memory accesses to optimize cache performance
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns for better latency
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for arrays A and C
// Review thread block size for optimal shared memory allocation and warp execution efficiency
