```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for fxh, fyh, fzh, fxt, fyt, and fzt arrays
// Consider using shared memory to optimize access for repeatedly used data like fxhj, fyhj, fzhj
// Use loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Prefetch data before use to hide latency
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the number of variables inside loop
// Optimize reduction loop by minimizing thread divergence
// Use atomic operations carefully to avoid bank conflicts
// Leverage CUDA occupancy calculator to maximize occupancy to improve performance
