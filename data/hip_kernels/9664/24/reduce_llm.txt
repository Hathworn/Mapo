```
// Use shared memory efficiently by ensuring coalesced memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores for better memory throughput
// Unroll loops to improve parallel execution efficiency
// Ensure proper alignment of double4 data to minimize warp divergence
