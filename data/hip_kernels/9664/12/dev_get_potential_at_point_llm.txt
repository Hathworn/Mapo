// Use shared memory to cache field particle positions for faster access
// Minimize the use of sqrtf by rearranging conditional checks
// Implement loop unrolling for better performance in field particles iteration
// Consider aligning data to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns through careful indexing of arrays
