```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring proper data alignment.
// Ensure the use of shared memory if multiple threads access the same data.
// Minimize the usage of global memory by storing frequently accessed data in registers.
// Evaluate the impact of memory padding for improving performance.
// If possible, prefer __device__ functions for commonly used computations to reduce code duplication.
