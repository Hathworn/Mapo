```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider pre-loading data into registers to minimize repeated global memory access.
// Minimize the use of complex arithmetic operations within loops for optimized performance.
// Align data structures to improve memory coalescing and reduce memory transaction issues.
// Utilize loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce the loop overhead and improve performance.
// If possible, reduce branching within the kernel to ensure warp execution efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize threads only when necessary, preventing unnecessary synchronization overhead.
