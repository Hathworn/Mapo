```
// Use shared memory to cache repeated access data points for faster retrieval
// Optimize for coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop for improved warp execution
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for the inner loop to enhance performance
// Employ float4 data types for better vectorization on compatible hardware
