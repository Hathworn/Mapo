```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Try to reduce divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency.
// Use fewer shared memory arrays to minimize register pressure.
// Ensure all threads write to global memory in a coalesced manner.
// Consider restructuring condition checks to minimize divergence.
// Try to reduce atomic operations by combining partial results in shared memory first.
