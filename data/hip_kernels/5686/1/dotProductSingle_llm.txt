// Consider using coalesced memory access for pValuesList to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by having threads operate on contiguous memory regions.
// Optimize the reduction step by utilizing warp shuffle instructions for better performance.
