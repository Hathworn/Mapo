// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure 1024 shared memory size fits within hardware limits
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated operations within the loop
// Proper synchronization with __syncthreads() before read operations
// Adjust shared memory allocation if blockDim.x changes
// Verify correctness of memory stride logic in the loop
