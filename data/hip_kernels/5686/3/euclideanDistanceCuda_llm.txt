```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve cache utilization.
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data are loaded before computation.
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to enhance memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory size does not exceed hardware limits.
// For improved performance, adjust the number of threads per block to fit GPU architecture.
