```
// Consider increasing the block size for better thread utilization
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Perform unroll loop optimization on the inner loop to improve memory coalescing and efficiency
// Utilize the warp shuffle operations effectively to minimize warp divergence
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better memory bandwidth utilization
