// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring data is stored in a way that threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when possible.
// Evaluate if vectorization can be applied to further enhance memory throughput.
// Assess data alignment to ensure optimal performance on different hardware architectures.
