// Consider using shared memory to cache the relevant phi values across threads in the block for coalescing reads.
// Preload phiL, phiR, phiU, and phiD to registers to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when reading from fi to fully utilize memory bandwidth.
