```
// Precompute indices to reduce redundant calculations and improve performance
// Use temporary variables to minimize repeated indexing and accesses, improving data locality
// Write from temporary variables to output arrays to maximize memory access throughput and improve locality
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Align memory accesses with cache lines to maximize coalesced memory accesses
