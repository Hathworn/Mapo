// Use shared memory for num_erased when frequently accessed by multiple threads  
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations in out_lod0  
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path  
// Consider loop unrolling if it improves performance
