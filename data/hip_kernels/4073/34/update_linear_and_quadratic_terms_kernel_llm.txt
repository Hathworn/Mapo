```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to cache repeatedly accessed values for reducing global memory I/O.
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergence within thread warps by avoiding conditional statements.
// Precompute invariant values outside the loop to save on repetitive calculations.
```
