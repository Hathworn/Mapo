```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use float2 for complex numbers to ensure proper alignment and optimal access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Ensure proper use of math functions for better performance (e.g., using sqrtf instead of sqrt).
// Employ warp-level primitives to handle reduction operations for optimizations.
