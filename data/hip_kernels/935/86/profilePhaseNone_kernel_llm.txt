```
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced memory reads
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data
// Minimize the use of expensive operations within critical loops
// Ensure memory allocations and transfers are done efficiently
// Use appropriate synchronization techniques to avoid race conditions
// Assess if register pressure is causing performance bottlenecks
// Utilize warp shuffling for reductions to reduce memory transactions
