```
// Use __ldg intrinsic to improve memory access patterns for color_permutation
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are configured for optimal occupancy
// Consider using shared memory to cache color_permutation data for frequently accessed areas
// Align row_colors and color_permutation arrays to improve memory coalescing
// Avoid unnecessary branching by streamlining the control flow within the loop
