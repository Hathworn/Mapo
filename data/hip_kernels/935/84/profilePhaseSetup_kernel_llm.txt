```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Assess the use of coalesced memory access patterns for better throughput.
// Evaluate thread block size for optimal warps occupancy and better computation distribution.
// Implement memory prefetching techniques if applicable.
// Avoid redundant memory accesses by reusing the loaded values when possible.
