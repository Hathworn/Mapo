```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth usage
// Use shared memory for temporary data storage if applicable
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing loaded data
// Align data structures to meet coalesced access requirements
// Ensure memory accesses are stride-1 whenever possible
