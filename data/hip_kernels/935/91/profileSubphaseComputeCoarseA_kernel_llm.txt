```
// Consider using vectorized data types for coalesced memory access
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide latency
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop
// Use __restrict__ keyword to help the compiler with memory optimizations
// Ensure data is correctly aligned for optimal memory transactions
