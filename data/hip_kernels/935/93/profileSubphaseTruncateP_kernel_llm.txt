```
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing global memory accesses where possible.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses and increase memory throughput.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to prevent memory bank conflicts.
// Consider increasing the block size to better utilize the GPU's SMs, if possible.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same code paths.
