```
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access
// Calculate global thread ID at the beginning for efficient indexing
// Prioritize simpler computational tasks over more complex ones
// Consider using warp shuffles or atomic operations for inter-thread communication
// Minimize divergent branching to ensure coalesced memory access
// Ensure threads are well-synchronized and complete tasks efficiently
// Optimize loop operations and avoid redundant calculations
