```
// Use memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a way that threads in the same warp access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring that the control flow inside the if statement is optimized for warp execution
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need to access the same data within a block
// Ensure that idx calculations and memory accesses are aligned to improve memory access patterns
