// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if the data can be reused within the block.
// Ensure coalesced accesses to global memory to improve performance.
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel to avoid divergence.
// Use appropriate grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and throughput.
