// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Avoid excessive conditional statements within the kernel to reduce branching.
// Use shared memory for common data accessed by multiple threads.
// Explore using warp shuffle operations for more efficient data exchange between threads.
