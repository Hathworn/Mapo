```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring that global memory accesses are coalesced.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergence and improve parallel efficiency.
// Review the thread block size for optimal occupancy and performance.
