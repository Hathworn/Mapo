// Consider coalescing memory access when reading from 'probs' to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Check for bank conflicts if shared memory is used to ensure efficient memory access.
// Evaluate the occupancy and adjust block size if necessary to improve performance.
