```
// Use shared memory to improve data locality and reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads
// Minimize divergent branching for better warp efficiency
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by carefully selecting block size
// Leverage prefetching techniques if applicable to hide memory latency
