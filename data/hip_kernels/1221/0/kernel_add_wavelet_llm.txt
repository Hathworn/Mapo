```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for d_u array.
// Ensure that d_wavelet is read in a memory coalesced manner.
// Check if shared memory can be utilized for d_wavelet to reduce global memory traffic.
// Evaluate if using a 2D block and grid size affects the memory access pattern and occupancy.
// Assess if loop unrolling or other compiler optimizations can be applied for the condition check.
