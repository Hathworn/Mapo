```
// Consider coalesced memory access pattern for better performance
// Minimize divergent execution between threads in a warp
// Optimize loop unrolling if applicable for the given input size
// Ensure enough threads are used to fully occupy the GPU
// Align data structures according to memory coalescing requirements
