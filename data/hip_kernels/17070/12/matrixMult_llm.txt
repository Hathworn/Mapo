```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to potentially improve performance
// Evaluate the potential of using warp-level operations for optimization
// Ensure coalesced memory access for n matrix to enhance memory throughput
// Investigate if using tensor cores (if available) could accelerate matrix multiplication
