```
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning memory access patterns
// Reduce global memory access latency by using registers
// Use shared memory for data reuse if applicable
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for efficient memory transactions
// Consider loop unrolling if more complex computations are involved
```
