// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel for better performance.
// Consider shared memory usage if data reuse within a warp is possible.
// Ensure data is properly aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
