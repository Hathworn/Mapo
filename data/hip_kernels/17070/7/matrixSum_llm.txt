// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Reduce memory accesses by register blocking techniques
// Align data structures to avoid misaligned memory access penalties
// Utilize asynchronous copy operations if possible
