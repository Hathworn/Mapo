```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring proper alignment.
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated accesses.
// Minimize divergent branching for threads within a warp.
// Employ coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Ensure that the grid and block sizes are optimized for the hardware.
// Utilize constant memory if input data remains unchanged throughout the kernel execution.
