```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to optimize global memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate if using shared memory would benefit the sorting of values.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned for better cache performance.
// Minimize the number of conditional checks in the kernel to enhance processing speed.
// Look into reducing thread divergence for improved warp execution efficiency.
