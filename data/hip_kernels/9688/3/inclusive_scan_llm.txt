```
// Use coalesced memory access when reading from global memory into shared memory
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() for efficiency where possible
// Optimize loop unrolling for the inclusive scan within block
// Consider offsetting shared memory reads to reduce bank conflicts
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when writing results to global memory
// Aggregate results efficiently to minimize unnecessary reads during accumulation
