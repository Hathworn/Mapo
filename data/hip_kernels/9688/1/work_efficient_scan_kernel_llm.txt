// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Consider coalesced accesses to global memory
// Utilize warp-level primitives to further optimize scan operations
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block and grid size for optimal performance
// Minimize costly global memory accesses where possible
