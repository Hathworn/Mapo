```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory load/store operations
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access
// Minimize unnecessary memory accesses by utilizing registers effectively
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for performance improvement
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by choosing optimal block size
// Investigate use of asynchronous memory operations if data dependencies allow
