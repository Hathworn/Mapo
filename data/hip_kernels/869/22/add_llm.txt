```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in memory.
// Ensure 'N' is a multiple of block size to avoid thread divergence.
// Use shared memory if there are common data access patterns for faster access.
// Minimize the use of global memory by reusing values in registers where possible.
// Consider restructuring data to improve memory access patterns.
