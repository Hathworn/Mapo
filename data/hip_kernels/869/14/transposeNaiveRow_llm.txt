```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by reordering data as needed.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory by padding memory.
// Utilize warp-shuffling methods to minimize global memory transactions.
// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance.
