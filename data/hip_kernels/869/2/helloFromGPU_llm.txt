```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to reduce transaction counts
// Optimize the use of printf by reducing the frequency if possible, it can impact performance
// Utilize warp divergence minimization techniques if control flow is present
