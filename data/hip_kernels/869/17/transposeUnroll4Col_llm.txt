```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by padding the allocation.
// Consider prefetching data into registers for even faster access.
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions to match the memory access pattern.
// Utilize warp shuffling to further minimize memory traffic.
// Align memory accesses to prevent potential performance penalties.
// Ensure memory transactions are coalesced for optimal throughput.
