```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread block dimensions to maximize warps usage and avoid resource underutilization
// Check if memory coalescing can be improved by reorganizing data access patterns
// Ensure memory reads/writes are aligned optimally to increase throughput
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if data is not aliased
