```
// Consider using shared memory to decrease global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved performance.
// Launch the kernel with optimal block size for better utilization.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory if shared memory is used.
// Experiment with loop unrolling if applicable for further optimization.
