// Optimize memory access by aligning data for vectorized loads and stores
// Use float2 for loading and storing to reduce memory transactions
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced for efficient data transfer
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed values to further reduce global memory traffic
