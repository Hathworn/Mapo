```c
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning thread indices with memory layout
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if encountering bank conflicts
// Implement loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and improve performance
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize thread divergence to maintain warp execution efficiency
```
