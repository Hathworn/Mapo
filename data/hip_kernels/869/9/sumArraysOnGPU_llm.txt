// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider coalesced access to global memory for better performance
// Ensure __syncthreads() is correctly used to prevent race conditions
// Optimize block size for maximum occupancy and performance
