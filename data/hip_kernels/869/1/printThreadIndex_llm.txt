```
// Consider using shared memory for better data reuse and reduced global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data to the warp size
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
// Use read-only data cache when possible to optimize memory access patterns
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency
```
