// Coalesce memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize memory transactions by reducing the number of memory accesses to global memory
// Optimize shared memory usage if applicable to reduce global memory latency
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures for efficient memory access patterns
// Use warp-level operations like __shfl_sync to reduce shared memory usage in futureoptimizations
