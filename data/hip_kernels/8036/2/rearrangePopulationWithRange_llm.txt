// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns
// Optimize shared memory usage to minimize bank conflicts
// Consider using half-warp shuffle operations for swapping to leverage warp efficiency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can reduce loop overhead and improve performance
