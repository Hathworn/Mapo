```
// Use shared memory to store a tile of the source image to minimize global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and increase parallelism.
// Coalesce memory accesses on destination image to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Optimize boundary checks using a single condition to minimize branching.
// Pre-calculate indices used in loops to eliminate redundant calculations within the loops.
// Convert 2D index calculations to 1D wherever possible to simplify indexing operations.
