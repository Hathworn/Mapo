```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead and increase throughput
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Optimize memory alignment to avoid misaligned access penalties
