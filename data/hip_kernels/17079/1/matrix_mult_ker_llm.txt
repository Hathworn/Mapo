```
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure proper synchronization between threads
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by reorganizing data access patterns
// Load data into shared memory in coalesced global memory access patterns
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() calls for better performance
// Ensure matrix dimensions are multiples of TILE_WIDTH for full occupancy
// Use loop unrolling in block-based multiplication for better performance
// Consider padding shared memory arrays to avoid bank conflicts
// Align shared memory access to ensure memory coalescing
// Use conditional statements to avoid out-of-bound memory access
