```cpp
// Optimize memory accesses by using shared memory to cache data for each block.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads access sequential memory addresses.
// Consider using texture memory for improved cache utilization on read-heavy workloads.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce the number of global memory accesses.
