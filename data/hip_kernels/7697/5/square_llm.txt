// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for partial results.
// Initialize shared memory to ensure data consistency.
// Reduce frequent global memory accesses by using shared memory.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when writing results back to global memory.
// Consider using atomic operations if necessary to avoid race conditions.
