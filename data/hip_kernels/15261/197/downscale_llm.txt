// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses
// Use shared memory for commonly accessed data within threads
// Minimize divergence by simplifying control flow statements
// Utilize registers for frequently used variables
// Apply loop unrolling for small scale_factor values to reduce loop overhead
