```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using continuous threads to access contiguous memory locations
// Utilize shared memory to further optimize memory transactions if possible
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing reused computations in registers
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Leverage texture memory for the source image if appropriate to take advantage of caching
// Align data structures and ensure data is 16-byte aligned for efficient memory access
// Investigate warp shuffle operations to reduce shared memory usage where applicable
