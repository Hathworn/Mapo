```
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access for common values like 'u', 'v', and 'src'.
// Minimize the usage of atomicAdd by accumulating results within registers first, then perform a single atomicAdd.
// Reduce thread divergence by reordering conditional statements within the loop.
// Avoid unnecessary recalculations like tx and ty by calculating them once per thread.
// Consider separating address calculations and boundary checks to improve efficiency.
