```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures
// Use __restrict__ keyword to minimize memory aliasing
// Optimize memory bandwidth by using shared memory if applicable
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance
// Utilize warp-level primitives for optimization in complex operations
