```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Evaluate the use of pinned memory to improve memory transfer speeds.
// Optimize block and grid size for maximum occupancy and performance.
// Assess the benefit of loop unrolling for reducing loop overhead.
