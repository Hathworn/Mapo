```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transaction counts.
// Consider launching with a thread block size that is a multiple of warp size for better warp utilization.
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations.
