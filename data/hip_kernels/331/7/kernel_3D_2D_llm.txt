```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Employ loop unrolling where applicable to reduce instruction overhead.
// Align data structures to ensure optimal memory access patterns and minimize memory banking conflicts.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization to enhance parallel execution efficiency.
// Utilize asynchronous memory copies to overlap computation and communication, minimizing idle periods.
