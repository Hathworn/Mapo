// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access for better performance
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency
// Minimize the use of printf() in kernels as it adds significant overhead
// Try to ensure warp-level synchronizations to avoid serialization
// Investigate further compiler optimization flags or options for additional performance improvements
