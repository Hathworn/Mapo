```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for idpts and isims to improve memory access efficiency.
// Ensure memory accesses for osim and odpt are coalesced to reduce global memory transaction overhead.
// Check if shared memory can be used to store intermediate calculations or data to reduce global memory access.
// Try to minimize branch divergence by reorganizing conditional statements.
// Check if loop unrolling is possible if applicable in other parts of the code to reduce overhead.
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal occupancy and memory access performance.
