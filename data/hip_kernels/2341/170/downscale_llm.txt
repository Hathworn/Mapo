```
// Leverage memory coalescing by structuring accesses to use continuous memory addresses.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses.
// Utilize texture memory for read-only data to exploit hardware caching benefits.
// Minimize divergent branches by reordering condition checks to favor the common case.
// Pre-compute constant expressions outside of loops to reduce redundant calculations.
// Optimize thread block size for the best balance between occupancy and latency hiding.
// Align data structures to ensure coalesced memory accesses for improved performance.
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable to provide the compiler with aliasing information.
