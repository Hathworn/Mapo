// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to outgrad during shared memory load.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts while accessing shared_outgrad.
// Check if blockDim.x is optimized for hardware-specific shared memory size.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to prevent performance bottlenecks.
