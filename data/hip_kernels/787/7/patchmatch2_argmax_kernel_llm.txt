```cpp
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Leverage loop unrolling to maximize instruction throughput.
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to reduce pointer aliasing overhead.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations.
