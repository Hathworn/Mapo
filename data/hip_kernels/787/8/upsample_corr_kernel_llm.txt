```
// Use shared memory to store common data accessed by multiple threads to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of caching.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses when reading from and writing to global memory for better performance.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied for any repetitive calculations to reduce overhead.
