```
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce the number of loop iterations
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Use texture memory for read-only data to leverage cache
// Consider using warp-level primitives to further optimize synchronization
