// Consider using shared memory to cache BP data for better memory access locality.
// Explore loop interchange strategies to improve data locality within the loops.
// Use texture memory for BP data if read-only access can optimize memory transactions.
// Assess for coalesced memory access patterns to ensure efficient global memory throughput.
// Evaluate warp-level intrinsics for potentially reducing redundant computations within loops.
