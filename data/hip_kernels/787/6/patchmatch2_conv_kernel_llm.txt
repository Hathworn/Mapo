```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for A, B, AP, and BP movements.
// Use shared memory to buffer data, reducing redundant global memory fetches.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by careful alignment of shared memory loads.
// Prefetch data into registers where possible for faster access.
// Balance shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize thread block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy.
