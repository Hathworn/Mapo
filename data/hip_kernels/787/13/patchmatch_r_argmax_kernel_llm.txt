```
// Early exit to avoid processing threads out of bounds
// Consolidate computation of x2 and y2 to minimize arithmetic operations
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance performance further
// Avoid redundant computations of size1 and size2 outside of kernel logic
// Use shared memory to buffer `conv` inputs during patch matching for improved memory access
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce branching and enhance data coherence
// Reduce repeated index calculations for accessing `correspondence` and `match`
