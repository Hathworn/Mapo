```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access where possible
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning shared memory access
// Consider using _ldg() for read-only data to enhance cache efficiency
// Load data into shared memory in a coalesced manner to improve performance
// Reduce redundant calculations by precomputing indices for faster access
