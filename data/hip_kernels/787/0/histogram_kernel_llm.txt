```
// Use shared memory to store minI and maxI for each channel to reduce global memory access.
// Consider load coalesced access pattern for input array I to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store partial histogram results for reduction before writing to global memory.
// Coalesce writes to the histogram by ensuring contiguous threads write to contiguous memory locations.
// Check if loop unrolling optimizations can be applied to the value checks and calculations for efficiency.
