```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access time
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory when loading data
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to avoid performance bottlenecks
// Consider increasing block size for better parallelism
// Try to maintain occupancy by adjusting block dimensions
