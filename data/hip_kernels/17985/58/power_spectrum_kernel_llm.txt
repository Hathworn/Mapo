```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization by restructuring the computation to minimize __syncthreads() usage.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses in global memory by aligning data strides properly.
// Consider using warp-level functions to minimize barriers and latency.
