```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for Ar and Aw to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for better memory access patterns.
// Optimize memory alignment and padding to avoid bank conflicts.
// Explore warp-level primitive use for parallel reduction of results.
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance for small loop ranges.
// Ensure the use of __restrict__ keyword if applicable to maximize compiler optimization.
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block and grid sizes per physical constraints.
