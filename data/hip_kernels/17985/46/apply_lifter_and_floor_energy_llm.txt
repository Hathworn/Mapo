```
// Optimization: Use shared memory for lifter coefficients to reduce global memory access.
// Optimization: Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure consistent shared memory load.
// Optimization: Distribute lifter application work across threads to increase parallelism.
// Optimization: Implement conditional and efficient memory update when applying energy.
