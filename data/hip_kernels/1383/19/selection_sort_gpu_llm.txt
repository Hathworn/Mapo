```
// Consider using shared memory to cache blocks of `dist` to optimize memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access to global memory for `dist` when loading into shared memory
// Use warp shuffle instructions to reduce the overhead of finding the minimum element across threads
// Try adjusting the thread block size to improve occupancy
// Avoid divergent branching by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same path
