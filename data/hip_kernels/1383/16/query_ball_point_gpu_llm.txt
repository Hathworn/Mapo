```
// Consider coalesced access for global memory in order to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Minimize divergent branching by considering alternative logic that reduces warp divergence, particularly in conditional statements.
// Ensure effective utilization of shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory calls.
// Use appropriate vectorized data types (e.g., float3) to optimize load/store operations for xyz1 and xyz2.
// Reorganize input data if possible to promote aligned and coalesced memory accesses.
// Evaluate using inline PTX or intrinsics for critical math operations to maximize performance.
