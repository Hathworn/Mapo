```
// Consider coalescing the memory access for xyz1 and xyz2 to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize if conditions inside the inner loop to reduce branch divergence.
// Use shared memory to cache xyz1 values during the loop for faster access.
// Try to optimize the loop by using warp-level primitives to reduce latency.
