```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to cache points data for coalesced access.
// Ensure idx array access is coalesced for improved memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling factor to match warp size for better ILP.
// Evaluate using a dynamic parallelism approach if potential speedup is identified.
