```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for xyz1 and xyz2 to improve memory efficiency
// Use shared memory to cache xyz2 coordinates within a block to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch data to reduce the memory latency
// Minimize divergent branches within loops for better thread execution efficiency
// Consider rearranging data access patterns to improve data locality
