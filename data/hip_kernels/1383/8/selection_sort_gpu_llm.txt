```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns in the first loop for improved memory throughput
// Reorder the loop structure to reduce branch divergence within threads
// Minimize swaps by comparing indices before performing them to save unnecessary memory operations
// Optimize stride access to ensure contiguous memory access when copying elements
```
