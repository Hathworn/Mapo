// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns when accessing grad_out and grad_points arrays.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling techniques can improve performance in the for loop.
// Consider the use of warp-synchronous programming to optimize atomic operations.
