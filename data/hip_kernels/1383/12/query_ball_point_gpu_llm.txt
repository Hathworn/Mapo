// Optimize memory access patterns for xyz1 and xyz2 for coalesced access  
// Consider shared memory usage for xyz1 and xyz2 if they fit in the shared memory  
// Use atomic operations where possible to prevent race conditions during idx updates  
// Experiment with different block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize thread divergence  
// Consider loop unrolling for both outer and inner loops for improved instruction throughput  
// Check warp-level parallelism to ensure full utilization of the device architecture
