// Use shared memory to cache points data for faster access
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses
// Utilize vectorized loads if possible to improve throughput
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal warp utilization
// Explore occupancy calculator tools for determining best grid configuration
// Investigate if register pressure can be reduced by limiting live variables
// Implement double buffering to overlap computation with data transfer
