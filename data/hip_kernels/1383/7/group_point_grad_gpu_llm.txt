```
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Utilize shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Align data structures to avoid misaligned memory accesses
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce overhead
// Ensure proper use of memory access order for better cache utilization
// Balance thread workload to avoid idle threads in warp
