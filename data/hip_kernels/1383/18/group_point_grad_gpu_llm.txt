```
// Use shared memory to store values that are repeatedly accessed, reducing global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput
// Adjust shared memory size based on maximum `m` and `nsample` to minimize bank conflicts
// Consider unrolling the innermost loop if `c` is small for better loop performance
// Evaluate benefits of using atomic operations vs potential race conditions and serialization
