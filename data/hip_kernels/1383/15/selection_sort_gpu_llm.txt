// Consider using shared memory for better memory access efficiency in sorting operations
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Investigate the possibility of reducing global memory accesses in the sorting loop
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives for thread collaboration in sorting steps
// Assess the kernel's launch configuration for optimal occupancy and performance
