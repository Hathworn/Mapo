// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory is used effectively within a block
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Load data into shared memory efficiently
// Consider coalesced access patterns for global memory reads
// Ensure synchronization after loading data to shared memory
// Optimize thread occupancy to maximize resource utilization
