```c
// Reduce global memory transactions by loading two elements per thread
// Use shared memory to store partial sums and minimize global memory access
// Implement loop unrolling for the reduction phase to enhance performance
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to improve efficiency
// Align shared memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
