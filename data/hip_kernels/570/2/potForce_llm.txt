```c
// Use shared memory to store PairWise elements and reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize redundant calculations by checking if delr2 equals zero only once.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Replace powf with custom inline calculations for efficiency.
