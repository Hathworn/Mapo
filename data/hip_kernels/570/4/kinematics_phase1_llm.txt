```
// Consider coalescing the memory accesses for positions, force, and vel to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to store intermediate results for positions, force, and vel within the block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the memory layout of the data structures to better align with memory access patterns of the GPU.
