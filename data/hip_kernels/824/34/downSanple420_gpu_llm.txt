```
// Consider using shared memory to coalesce global memory accesses and reduce latency
// Utilize texture memory where possible to take advantage of caching
// Ensure optimal data layout in memory to improve cache hit
// Investigate loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
// Avoid divergent branches inside critical loops
