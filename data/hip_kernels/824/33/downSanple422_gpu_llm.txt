```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses for downCh1 and downCh2
// Use texture cache effectively by ensuring coalesced accesses
// Optimize pixelCoord calculation to minimize arithmetic operations
// Use loop unrolling if possible to enhance throughput
// Reduce register usage by optimizing variable scope and usage
// Consider memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput
