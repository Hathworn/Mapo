```
// Optimize warp divergence by using even-odd division directly
// Ensure coalesced memory access to downCh1 and downCh2 to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize the use of branching logic to enhance warp execution efficiency
