// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Optimize grid and block size for better occupancy and performance
// Consider memory alignment for improved memory bandwidth
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ to avoid unnecessary pointer aliasing checks
// Assess potential benefits of using multiple streams for concurrent execution
