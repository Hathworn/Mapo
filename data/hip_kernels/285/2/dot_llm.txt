```
// Consider using shared memory to store partial results and reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize coalesced memory access by reordering data structures if necessary
// Ensure appropriate use of atomic operations to minimize contention
// Explore using warp-level primitives to reduce atomic operations if possible
