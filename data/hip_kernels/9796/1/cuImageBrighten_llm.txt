```
// Consider coalescing memory access for device memory reads and writes
// Use shared memory where applicable to reduce global memory latency
// Adjust block size to maximize occupancy and memory throughput
// Prefetch data to the shared memory to hide memory access latency
// Use asynchronous copies where possible to overlap computation and memory transfer
