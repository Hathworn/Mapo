// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses during reduction.  
// Implement memory coalescing for d_in accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Conditionally load data only when myId is within bounds to avoid unnecessary global memory reads.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have finished updating shared memory before proceeding.
// Employ loop unrolling techniques for the warp-level reduction to minimize instruction overhead.
// Utilize volatile keyword for shared memory in warp reduction to prevent compiler optimizations that might reorder accesses.
// Avoid redundant writes to shared memory during reduction steps to reduce memory latency.  
// Consider tuning blockDim.x based on the hardware's warp size for optimal performance.
