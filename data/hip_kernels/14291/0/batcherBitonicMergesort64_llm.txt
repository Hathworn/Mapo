```
// Consider using shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize the loading of data into shared memory to minimize latency
// Evaluate the possibility of data coalescing to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores if data alignment allows
// Ensure that shared memory accesses are bank conflict-free
