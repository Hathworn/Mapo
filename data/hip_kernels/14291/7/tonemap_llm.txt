```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for common data
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Utilize vectorized operations where possible to enhance data processing
// Optimize register usage to decrease pressure and avoid spilling
// Reduce warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths
```
