```cpp
// Optimization: Consider coalesced global memory access to improve memory throughput
// Optimization: Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimization: Align data accesses to memory boundaries to avoid uncoalesced accesses
// Optimization: Use memory prefetching to hide latency of global memory loads
