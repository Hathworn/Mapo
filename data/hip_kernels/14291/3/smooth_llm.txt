```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access for v and v_new arrays
// Consider using shared memory for elements that are accessed by multiple threads
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling for potential performance gain
// Ensure appropriate synchronization if shared memory is used
