```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Minimize divergent warps by optimizing branch conditions
// Use pinned memory for faster data transfers between host and device
// Implement loop unrolling for frequently executed loops to reduce instruction overhead
```
