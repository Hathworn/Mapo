```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses to warp boundaries.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory reads/writes.
// Reduce the number of synchronizations; ensure __syncthreads() is necessary.
// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance in up_sweep_512 and down_sweep_512.
// Evaluate using bank conflict-free memory access patterns in shared memory.
// Balance computation and memory access within block to enhance efficiency.
// Optimize global memory access patterns by accessing data in strided manner.
// Align memory allocations to power of 2 to improve memory access speed.
