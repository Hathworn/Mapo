```
// Consider utilizing shared memory to cache frequently accessed gradOutput_data to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread indices with data indices.
// Optimize loop unrolling for the accumulation process to improve computation efficiency.
// Consider limiting the use of local variables to reduce register pressure and achieve better occupancy.
// Investigate compiler flags or pragma directives to assist with vectorization and further optimize memory access patterns.
