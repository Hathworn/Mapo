```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Consider storing intermediate results in shared memory to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use __powf when possible for better performance with single-precision pow.
// Precompute constant values outside the loop to improve efficiency.
// Ensure the loop variable increment aligns with warp size to optimize execution.
