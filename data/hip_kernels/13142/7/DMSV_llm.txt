```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for loading V into shared memory
// Align shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer parameters to optimize memory access
// Implement loop unrolling for the main computation loop
// Minimize global memory accesses by efficiently using shared memory
