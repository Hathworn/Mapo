```
// Ensure block and grid dimensions are optimized to maximize occupancy
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth
// Consider utilizing shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Reduce register usage to allow more warps to be active concurrently
// Align data structures to 128 bytes to benefit from vectorized memory operations
