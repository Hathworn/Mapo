```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for partial sums.
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Use warp-level primitives like __shfl_down to optimize reduction within a warp.
