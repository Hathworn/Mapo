```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to enhance memory throughput.
// Ensure all threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Avoid warp divergence by restructuring control flow if possible.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Reduce bank conflicts while accessing shared memory for better performance.
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration according to the hardware capabilities.
