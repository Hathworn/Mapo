```
// Optimize memory access patterns to exploit coalesced memory access
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure there are no bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Evaluate if warp shuffle instructions can replace shared memory for reduction
// Use __syncthreads() appropriately to ensure memory consistency after each iteration
// Adjust the grid and block dimensions for more efficient hardware utilization
// Explore the use of atomic operations if reducing on arbitrary positions
// Profile the kernel to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize further
