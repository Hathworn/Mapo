// Optimize memory access by coalescing memory reads and writes.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible.
// Consider loop unrolling for both i and j loops to maximize warp utilization.
// Use pinned memory if data transfer between host and device is a bottleneck.
// Vectorize arithmetic operations to fully utilize the FPU.
