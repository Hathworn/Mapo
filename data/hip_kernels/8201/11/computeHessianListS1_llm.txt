```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory fetches.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce repeated global memory loads.
// Optimize memory stride access patterns to further enhance memory coalescing.
// Reduce divergent branching by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths.
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data that is repeatedly accessed.
// Minimize use of double precision arithmetic in favor of single precision where possible for better performance.
