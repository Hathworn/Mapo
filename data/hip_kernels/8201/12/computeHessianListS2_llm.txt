```
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated voxel calculations and accesses.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for the inner loop for more efficient computation.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed values like gauss_d1 if they remain constant across kernel calls.
// Minimize divergent branches within the thread group for enhanced performance.
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize coalescing.
