```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load data into shared memory outside the inner loop if possible
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data to warp size
// Use __syncthreads() carefully to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
// Read-only data should be broadcasted efficiently using shared memory
