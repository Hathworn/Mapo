// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Ensure the loop is unrolled efficiently for the scale_factor.
// Investigate if warp-level primitives can increase performance.
// Prefetch gradOutput_data to registers to reduce global memory latency.
