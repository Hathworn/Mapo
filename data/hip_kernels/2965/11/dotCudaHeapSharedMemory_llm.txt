```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to optimize global memory throughput.
// Ensure stride loop maintains memory coalescing for better performance.
// Avoid excessive bank conflicts in shared memory for improved efficiency.
// Use of atomics can be a bottleneck; consider using warp-level primitives.
