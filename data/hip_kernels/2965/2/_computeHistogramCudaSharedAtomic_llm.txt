```
// Use __restrict__ to improve memory access efficiency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by initializing only necessary indices.
// Utilize atomic operations for conflict-free updates in shared memory.
// Minimize global memory access by accumulating results in shared memory first.
// Increase occupancy by adjusting block and grid sizes based on hardware.
// Consider loop unrolling or vectorization for better performance.
