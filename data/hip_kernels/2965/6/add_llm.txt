// Consider aligning memory accesses for 'a' and 'b' to improve coalesced memory access.
// Use atomic operations or warp shuffle functions to minimize divergence and synchronization overhead.
// Investigate using vectorized loads/stores to reduce the number of memory transactions.
// Optimize block and grid size to maximize occupancy and load balancing across the GPU.
// Profile and ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits to prevent occupancy reduction.
// Evaluate benefits of using registers for frequently accessed variables within loops.
