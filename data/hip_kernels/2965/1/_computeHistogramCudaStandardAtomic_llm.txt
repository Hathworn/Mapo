```cpp
// Use shared memory to mitigate the high latency of global memory accesses.
// Accumulate results in localHist to reduce the number of atomic operations on global memory.
// Initialize sharedHist to zero within the first 256 threads to prepare for partial histogram reduction.
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions.
// Final reduction step by atomic adding sharedHist to the global histogram.
