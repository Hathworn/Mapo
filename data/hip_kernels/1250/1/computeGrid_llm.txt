```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load boundary data into shared memory to avoid redundant global memory reads
// Ensure efficient coalesced memory access patterns for global memory
// Synchronize threads after loading data to shared memory to prevent data hazards
// Optimize for boundary threads by minimizing conditional checks
```
