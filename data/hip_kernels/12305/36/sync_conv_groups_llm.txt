```c
// Consider minimizing the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure balanced workload across threads for optimal performance
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce latency
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Align memory accesses to ensure coalesced access
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives for efficiency
