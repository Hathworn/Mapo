```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate values for reduction operations
// Optimize memory access by ensuring pred, truth, delta, and error are coalesced
// Ensure the kernel launch configuration maximizes occupancy and reduces warp divergence
// Use asynchronous memory copies for efficient data transfers
