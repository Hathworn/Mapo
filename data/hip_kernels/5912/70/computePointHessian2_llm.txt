// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses by aligning data access patterns
// Reduce register usage by reusing variables within the loop
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
