```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling for the main loop to reduce overhead
// If overflow checks can be guaranteed, consider removing redundant conditionals
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to hint the compiler about non-aliasing memory
// Consider using texture memory for access patterns with spatial locality
