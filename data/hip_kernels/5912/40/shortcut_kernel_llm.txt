```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if applicable.
// Minimize the use of division operations by replacing them with bitwise shifts where possible.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling in cases with known iteration counts to reduce loop overhead.
// Align memory accesses to the boundary of the memory architecture's block size for efficiency.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if aliases are not used to improve compiler optimizations.
// Precompute constant expressions outside of the loop to reduce redundant calculations.
