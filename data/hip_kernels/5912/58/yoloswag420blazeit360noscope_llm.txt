// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for better memory throughput.
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Align data processing per warp to take advantage of memory coalescing.
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
