```
// Minimize global memory access by leveraging shared memory
// Reduce redundant calculations by computing index transformations outside the loop
// Use loop unrolling for the innermost loop to improve performance
// Optimize memory coalescing by adjusting data access pattern
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better resource utilization
