```c
// Precompute scale factor outside of loops to reduce redundant calculations
// Replace repeated index calculations with a temp variable to improve efficiency
// Utilize shared memory if appropriate to optimally cache frequently accessed data
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied for better performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access to maximize memory throughput
// Consider using float4 for loading data if alignment allows to reduce memory transactions
