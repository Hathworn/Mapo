```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for the input if possible.
// Use loop unrolling to decrease the number of iterations.
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations within the loop by calculating offsets efficiently.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by verifying memory strides and indexes.
