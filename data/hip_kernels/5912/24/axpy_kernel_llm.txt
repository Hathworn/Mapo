```c
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve memory coalescing
// Reuse data in registers to reduce memory access latency
// Experiment with different block size and grid size for hardware utilization
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to cache repeated data access within a block
```
