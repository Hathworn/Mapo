// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring pred, truth, delta, and error arrays are appropriately aligned
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring conditionals to favor common paths
// Ensure enough threads per block to fully utilize the GPU's occupancy
// Use shared memory if possible to cache frequently accessed data within the block
