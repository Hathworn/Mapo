```c
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to inform the compiler about non-aliasing
// Evaluate if atomic operations can be minimized or eliminated for performance gains
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data layout to minimize memory divergence
// Consider using half-precision (float16) if precision requirements allow for reduced memory access
```
