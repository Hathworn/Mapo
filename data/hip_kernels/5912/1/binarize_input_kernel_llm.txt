```
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive elements
// Limit conditional checks inside the loop for better efficiency
// Balance computation and memory access to optimize throughput
// Minimize use of global memory by using shared memory if possible
```
