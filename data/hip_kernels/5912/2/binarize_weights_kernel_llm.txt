```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory instead of global memory
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading weights into shared memory
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory
// Avoid duplication of calculations by reusing shared memory for mean calculation
// Consider using loop unrolling for the mean calculation to potentially increase efficiency
