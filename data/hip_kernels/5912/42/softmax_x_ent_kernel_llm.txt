```
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pred, truth, delta, and error pointers to indicate no aliasing for better optimization
// Align memory access to 128 bytes boundary for coalesced global memory access
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to decrease global memory access latency
// Optimize the conditional statement to reduce branch divergence by using warp-level primitives
// Use atomic operations if required to update shared or global states to avoid race conditions
// Minimize register usage by optimizing local variable usage and favor using float data type
