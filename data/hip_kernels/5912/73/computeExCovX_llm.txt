```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data like trans_x, trans_y, trans_z to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for trans_x, trans_y, trans_z to enhance memory throughput.
// Unroll loop during matrix-vector product calculations for better instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for valid_points, starting_voxel_id, and voxel_id arrays.
