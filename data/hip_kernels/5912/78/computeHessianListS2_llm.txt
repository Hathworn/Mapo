// Use shared memory to store centroid data for faster access and reduced global memory accesses.
// Consider prefetching `d_x`, `d_y`, `d_z` into registers to minimize global memory fetch latency.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for `trans_x`, `trans_y`, `trans_z`, `e_x_cov_x` for optimal memory bandwidth utilization.
// Reduce id-based computation overhead by using warp-level constructs where possible to leverage intra-warp communication.
