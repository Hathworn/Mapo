```
// Consider using shared memory to store icov0, icov1, and icov2 to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for pg_start and cov_dxd_pi_start for improved memory throughput.
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by ensuring the data is kept in registers when possible.
// Ensure stride-based access pattern in the main loop for better warp utilization and to hide memory latency.
