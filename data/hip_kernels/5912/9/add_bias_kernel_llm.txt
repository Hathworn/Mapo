// Consider using shared memory for biases to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access pattern to improve coherence and reduce warp divergence.
// Ensure that strides are optimized to minimize bank conflicts and maximize throughput.
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead within the for-loop.
