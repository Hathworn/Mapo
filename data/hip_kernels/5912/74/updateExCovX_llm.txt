```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize global memory accesses by merging multiple read/write operations
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to increase memory throughput
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations
// Assess if the workload is evenly distributed among threads to prevent load imbalance
// Consider adjusting the block size or grid size to achieve better occupancy
