// Consider using shared memory to store portions of X and Y to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using loop unrolling to improve the throughput of the loop processing.
// Utilize const memory if X or Y contains constants or unchanging elements across iterations.
