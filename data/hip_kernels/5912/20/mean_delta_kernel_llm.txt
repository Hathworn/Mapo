```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy
// Use shared memory to store delta values locally if beneficial
// Apply loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead
// Minimize divergence by ensuring branches are consistent
// Consider using texture memory if delta data exhibits 2D locality
// Profile performance to determine if reducing precision (float -> half) is advantageous
