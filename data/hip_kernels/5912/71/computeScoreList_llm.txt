```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for starting_voxel_id and voxel_id arrays
// Improve memory access by ensuring e_x_cov_x is accessed coalesced
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory latency if possible
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance performance
// Use vectorized loads and stores if the architecture supports it
```
