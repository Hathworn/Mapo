```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if data alignment allows
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring INCX and INCY are 1 where possible
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same instruction
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimum performance
// Prefetch data to reduce latency where applicable
