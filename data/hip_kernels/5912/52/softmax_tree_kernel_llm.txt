```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like group_offset.
// Minimize global memory accesses by fetching input and group data into shared memory.
// Use loop unrolling techniques in the softmax calculation for efficiency.
// Ensure optimal use of registers to avoid bank conflicts and reduce latency.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalesced memory transactions.
// Consider using __shfl_down_sync for warp-synchronous reduction in the sum computation.
// Assess grid and block size configuration for better occupancy and memory throughput.
// Investigate the parallelism within the softmax computation to spread work evenly across threads.
