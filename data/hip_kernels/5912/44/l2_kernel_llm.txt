```
// Consider coalescing memory access for pred and truth arrays.
// Optimize shared memory usage if beneficial for larger blocks.
// Evaluate impact of memory alignment on error and delta arrays.
// Assess benefits of utilizing texture memory for read-only data.
// Check for warp divergence and optimize control flow if needed.
