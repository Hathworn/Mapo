```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure that INCX and INCY do not hinder memory coalescing
// Evaluate using shared memory to cache data if reuse across threads is high
// Consider employing warp-level primitives for better performance
// If applicable, increase occupancy by adjusting block size
