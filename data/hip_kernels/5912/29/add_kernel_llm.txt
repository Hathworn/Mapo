```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure the grid is structured to maximize occupancy and avoid underutilization
// Experiment with different block sizes to achieve optimal performance
