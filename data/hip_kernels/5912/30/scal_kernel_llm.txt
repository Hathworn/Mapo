// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in X.
// Explore the use of loop unrolling techniques for further optimization of the loop iteration.
// Experiment with adjusting block and grid sizes to fully utilize the available computational resources.
