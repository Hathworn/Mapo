```
// Consider utilizing shared memory for s, dc, a, and b to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use temporary variables to hold repeatedly accessed values from global memory to decrease the number of memory accesses.
// Optimize data access patterns to ensure coalesced memory transactions, especially for arrays a, b, s, and dc.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling could provide benefits depending on the loop iteration count and hardware characteristics.
// Investigate using warp-level primitives for synchronization and efficient memory access where applicable.
