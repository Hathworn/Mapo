```
// Coalesced memory access by calculating optimal indexing pattern
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to spatial segments
// Load balance by ensuring evenly distributed work across threads
// Minimize divergent branching by consolidating conditional logic
// Align memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency
