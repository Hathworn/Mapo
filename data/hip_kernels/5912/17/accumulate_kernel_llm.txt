```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize global memory transactions by maximizing shared memory usage
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a linear pattern
// Use thread synchronization effectively with __syncthreads()
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by adjusting data access patterns
```
