// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Reduce global memory accesses by caching repeated calculations in local variables.
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data to optimize memory access patterns.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by properly aligning data structure layout.
// Explore using texture memory for read-only inputs if it can reduce global memory reads.
