// Precompute filter_offset to reduce redundant computations during iteration
// Precompute batch_offset to minimize repeated calculations in inner loops
// Accumulate in local variable temp_mean to optimize memory access patterns
// Use scaled accumulation result for final mean calculation to improve precision 
// Ensure index calculations are performed outside of inner loop to reduce overhead
