```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for j_ang.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for valid_points to improve memory throughput.
// Load j_ang into shared memory only if necessary to reduce redundant operations.
// Use appropriate loop strides to avoid idle threads in handling valid_points.
// Consider aligning x, y, z, and respective pg arrays to improve memory access patterns.
