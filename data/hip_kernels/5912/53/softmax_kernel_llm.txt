// Use __syncthreads to ensure all threads have written to shared memory before proceeding.
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_xor_sync for faster data exchange.
// Use atomic operations responsibly as they can create contention and slow down execution.
// Minimize atomic operations where possible by restructuring code to reduce contention.
// Ensure shared memory usage is within hardware limits for optimal performance.
// Consider loop unrolling if n is small and predictable to reduce overhead in for loops.
