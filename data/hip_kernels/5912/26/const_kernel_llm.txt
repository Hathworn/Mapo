```
// Ensure global memory is accessed coalesced by using contiguous INCX values
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Consider warp-level reductions if ALPHA is computed or modified within the kernel
// Optimize occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size based on the GPU architecture
