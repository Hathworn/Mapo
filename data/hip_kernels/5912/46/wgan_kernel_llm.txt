```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning memory access within warps
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated data accesses within a block
// Assess memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory if used
// Minimize conditional branches within the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
// Implement loop unrolling if the loop iteration count is known and beneficial
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifier if there is no aliasing of pointers
