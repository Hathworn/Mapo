// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Ensure shared memory size (col_cache) is sufficient and adjust accordingly.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize loop with unrolling where applicable for better performance.
// Assess the possibility of coalescing global memory accesses, particularly in col_cache loading.
