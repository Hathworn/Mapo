// Optimize data copying with boundary checks to reduce global memory access.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize data transfer from global memory.
// Optimize copying back with boundary checks to avoid unnecessary global memory writes.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns are utilized for global memory operations.
