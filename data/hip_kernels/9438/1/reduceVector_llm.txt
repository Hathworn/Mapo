// Ensure optimal block size for memory coalescing
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory
// Synchronize threads to avoid race conditions when accessing shared memory
// Consider using warp-level primitives for further reduction optimization
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
