```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring data is contiguous for each thread
// Ensure TAM_V is a multiple of blockDim.x * gridDim.x for complete loop unrolling
// Avoid bank conflicts while accessing shared memory
// Consider prefetching data to registers if applicable
