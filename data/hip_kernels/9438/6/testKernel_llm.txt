```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when reading from global memory
// Consider loop unrolling to optimize computations for specific block sizes
// Use atomic operations to safely update shared memory if needed
// Align memory access to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Employ occupancy analysis to determine optimal block and grid sizes
```
