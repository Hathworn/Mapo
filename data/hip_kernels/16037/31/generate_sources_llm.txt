```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize warps divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Align data structures to improve coalesced memory accesses
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for your hardware
// Ensure memory accesses are contiguous for improved cache performance
