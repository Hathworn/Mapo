// Use coalesced memory access for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider optimizing block size based on the architecture for maximum occupancy
// Reduce memory latency by ensuring 'p' is aligned with warp size boundaries
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring 'p' is accessed in a coalesced manner
