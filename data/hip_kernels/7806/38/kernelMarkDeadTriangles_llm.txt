// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for cmarker and cnewtri arrays.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer parameters to help compiler optimize memory access. 
// Reduce divergent branching by using ternary operations as shown in the condition.
