// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory alignment.
// Use shared memory for data that is repeatedly accessed by threads.
// Use coalesced memory accesses for better performance.
// Reduce redundant global memory accesses where possible.
// Consider using asynchronous memory copy to optimize data transfer.
