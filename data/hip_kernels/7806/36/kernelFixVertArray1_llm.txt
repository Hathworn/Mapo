```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Group memory accesses to enable coalesced memory accesses, reducing memory transaction overhead.
// Minimize atomic operations or use atomic operations that are contention-free to improve performance.
// Optimize thread block sizes to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient use of computational resources.
