```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous memory patterns.
// Minimize memory divergence by accessing voronoiPtr sequentially.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access in cboundary.
// Prefetch patternPtr data into registers for reuse within the loop.
// Optimize loop to reduce dependency chain and improve ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
