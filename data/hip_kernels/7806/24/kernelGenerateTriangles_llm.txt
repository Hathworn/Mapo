```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve data locality
// Prefetch data whenever possible to hide latency
// Consider loop unrolling for the while loop to improve throughput
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for increased bandwidth efficiency
// Try to minimize divergent branches within the switch-case statement
