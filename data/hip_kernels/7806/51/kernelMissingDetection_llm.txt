```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous global memory to improve throughput.
// Consider allocating cactive and cvertarr in a single linear memory segment to avoid memory allocation overhead.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier if possible, to provide hints to the compiler about non-aliasing data for optimization.
