```
// Consider optimizing memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed arrays.
// Use coalesced memory accesses for better performance when accessing cnewtri and cprefix arrays.
// Ensure that data accesses in loops are coalesced to minimize memory access latency.
// Evaluate the use of registers to store frequently used variables such as value and indexes.
