// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for triangle vertices
// Coalesce global memory accesses of ctriangles[] for better memory performance
// Consider rearranging data layout for cvertarr[] to improve memory coalescing
// Evaluate if reducing atomic operations is possible for better parallel efficiency
