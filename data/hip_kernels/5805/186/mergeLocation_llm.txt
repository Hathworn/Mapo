```
// Use a stride loop for better memory coalescing and efficient utilization of GPU threads
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory if the data reuse can be identified within a block
// Optimize the number of blocks and threads to fully utilize the GPU
// Use appropriate scale factor calculation to prevent redundant computations
