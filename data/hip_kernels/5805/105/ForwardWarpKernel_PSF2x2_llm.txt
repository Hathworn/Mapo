```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache `u`, `v`, and `src` for better memory access patterns.
// Use texture memory for `u`, `v`, and `src` if they are read-only to take advantage of caching.
// Optimize the global memory access by coalescing loads from `dst`, `normalization_factor`.
// Consider adjusting the block size to better fit the GPU architecture's occupancy and reduce warp divergence.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by restructuring the algorithm to reduce contention.
// Precompute repeated expressions such as `flow_row_offset + j` to reduce redundant calculations.
