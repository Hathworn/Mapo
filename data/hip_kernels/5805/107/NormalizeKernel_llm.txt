```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput.
// Ensure normalization_factor and image arrays are aligned for better performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses to normalization_factor.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized operations to optimize memory bandwidth.
