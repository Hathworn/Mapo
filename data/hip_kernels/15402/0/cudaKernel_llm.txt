```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for optimal performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize the block size and grid size for better resource utilization
// Minimize branching within the kernel to enhance warp efficiency
// Employ loop unrolling to increase execution speed
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques to hide memory latency
```
