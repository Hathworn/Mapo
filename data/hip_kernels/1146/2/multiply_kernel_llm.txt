```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structure or accessing consecutive memory locations.
// Assess using a larger block size to maximize occupancy and balance between computation and memory latency.
// Explore use of constant memory if accessing the same data across multiple threads.
// Evaluate use of vectorized memory operations for improved memory throughput.
