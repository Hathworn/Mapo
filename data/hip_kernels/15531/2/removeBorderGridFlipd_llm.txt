```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data access patterns to minimize bandwidth usage.
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and memory throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to enhance execution efficiency.
