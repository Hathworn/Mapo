```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently used variables like alpha and delta
// Avoid redundant reads by loading data into temporary variables
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase speed
// Consider coalesced access patterns to minimize memory transaction overhead
// Optimize thread block size for best occupancy and performance
