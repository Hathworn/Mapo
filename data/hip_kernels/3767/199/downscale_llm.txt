```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to gradInput_data and gradOutput_data for better performance
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses and minimize memory latency
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by aligning loop iterations with warp size
// Evaluate potential use of asynchronous memory prefetching to optimize memory access patterns
```
