```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency if shared data is frequently reused
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction throughput
// Evaluate occupancy rate to determine if more threads per block could improve performance
