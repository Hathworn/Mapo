```
// Consider increasing tile size for higher data re-use in shared memory
// Align memory accesses to ensure coalesced memory access
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring memory accesses are well-aligned
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Optimize loop bounds and conditions for reducing overhead
