```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed src data
// Optimize access patterns by ensuring coalesced global memory accesses for src and dst
// Reduce atomic operations by aggregating results in shared memory before writing back to global memory
// Verify correct use of __forceinline__ for performance benefit in critical functions
// Ensure grid and block sizes optimize occupancy while minimizing warp divergence
