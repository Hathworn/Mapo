```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access in fetching flow values
// Use texture memory for read-only image data to improve memory access patterns
// Group threads into warps that access memory locations contiguously to utilize coalesced memory access
// Preload frequently accessed variables into registers to minimize repeated global memory access
// Ensure blocks are sized appropriately to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency
