```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory reads, especially for non-cached reads.
// Check if loop unrolling could improve performance for this computation.
// Ensure the kernel is launched with an optimal number of threads per block.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find optimal performance.
// Analyze the memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts.
