```c
// Optimize shared memory usage to improve cache hits
// Align shared memory loads with warp size to reduce bank conflicts
// Use loop unrolling in critical sections to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap computation with data loading
// Evaluate replacing fminf/fmaxf with integer operations if precision permits
// Minimize calls to __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
```
