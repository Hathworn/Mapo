```
// Use memory coalescing while loading data into shared memory.
// Ensure shared memory usage is minimized to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider using thread loop unrolling to improve load/store efficiency.
// Overlap computation with memory operations to hide latency.
// Reduce warp divergence in conditional statements to maintain efficiency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by evaluating if overlaps can be avoided.
