```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures if possible.
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for better reuse.
// Load constants into registers if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Remove excessive use of __syncthreads if not required for inter-thread communication.
```
