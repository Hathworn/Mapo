```
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Reorganize the thread computations to ensure coalesced global memory access
// Consider using memory padding to ensure 32-byte alignment
// Optimize the loop bounds to improve performance
// Combine conditional statements to reduce branching
// Use the bitwise AND operation for modulo calculation to enhance performance
// Unroll loops or replace loops with arithmetic operations if possible
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction operations to improve efficiency
