```
// Use shared memory to cache d_Data values for threads in a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring linear access patterns in d_Data and d_Result.
// Ensure optimal block size and grid size to maximize occupancy and efficiently use the GPU resources.
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning shared memory accesses appropriately.
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable to optimize compiler memory access assumptions.
