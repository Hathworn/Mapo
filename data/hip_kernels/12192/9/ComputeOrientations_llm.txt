```
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory access
// Clamp xi and yi to avoid accessing out of bounds memory
// Avoid divergent branches by using shared memory efficiently
// Precompute Gaussian weights to reduce repetitive computations
// Use atomic operations if concurrent writes to shared memory are possible 
// Use loop unrolling for combining histogram values to improve performance
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to ensure all threads have finished computations before further processing
