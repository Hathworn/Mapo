```
// Use shared variables for improved memory access times
// Avoid repeated calculations, reuse results
// Utilizing intrinsic functions for better performance
// Use __fdividef for fast division when precision is acceptable
// Simplify multiplication in index calculations
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for global read operations
// Review use of constant memory for frequently accessed read-only variables
