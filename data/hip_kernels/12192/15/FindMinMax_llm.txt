// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory with boundary check
// Loop unrolling for processing 16 consecutive rows
// Min/max reduction
// Parallel reduction with loop unrolling
// Avoid unnecessary checks in reduction
// Store final results for each block in global memory
