```cpp
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve performance.
// Consider using shared memory if there is data reuse among threads.
// Reduce divergent branches by reorganizing conditional logic.
// Minimize atomic operations to essential cases to decrease contention.
// Leverage warp-level primitives for synchronization within a block.
