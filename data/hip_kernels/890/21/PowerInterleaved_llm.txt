// Cache src values in registers to reduce global memory accesses
// Use shared memory for intermediate results if necessary for further reduction of memory latency
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Ensure enough parallel work to hide memory latency by using a sufficient number of threads per block
