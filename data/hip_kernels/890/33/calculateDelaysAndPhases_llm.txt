```cpp
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads and writes where possible.
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory transactions.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path as much as possible.
// Consider using constant memory for any parameters that are read-only and frequently accessed.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for floating-point operations to improve access speed and efficiency.
// Avoid type conversions in performance-critical sections to minimize overhead.
