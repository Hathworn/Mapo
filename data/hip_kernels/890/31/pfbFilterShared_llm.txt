```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for loading taps into shared memory
// Consider increasing block size if shared memory allows, to improve occupancy and performance
// Ensure that the shared memory allocation is optimal for the hardware architecture
// Align shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts
// Avoid redundant calculations by pre-computing repeatable values outside loops if possible
