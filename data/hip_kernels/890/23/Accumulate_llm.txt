```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Use vectorized loading/storing where possible for better bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop
