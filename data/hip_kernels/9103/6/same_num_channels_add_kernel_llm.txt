```
// Use shared memory to further enhance memory access speed if data reuse occurs within the block
// Use loop unrolling if the number of elements processed per thread is known and fixed
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better memory access patterns and efficiency
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce memory access latency
