```c
// Consider unrolling loops within the kernel to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Increase block size if register pressure allows, to maximize occupancy.
// Align data access to 128-byte boundaries to make use of coalesced memory access.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure that data_r size does not exceed shared memory capacity per block.
