```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better bandwidth utilization
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access nearby data elements
// Consider loop unrolling if kernel performance improvement is required
// Balance workload among threads to avoid warp divergence
// Assess the usage of constant memory for frequently accessed data
