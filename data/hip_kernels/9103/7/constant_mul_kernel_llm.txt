// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by using consecutive indices.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data fragment.
// Use vectorized operations if suitable to process multiple data elements per thread.
// Adjust block and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy based on the specific GPU architecture.
