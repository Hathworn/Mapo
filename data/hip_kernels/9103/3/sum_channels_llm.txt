```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Use appropriate memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts
// Evaluate the grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Consider using asynchronous memcpy and streams for better concurrency
