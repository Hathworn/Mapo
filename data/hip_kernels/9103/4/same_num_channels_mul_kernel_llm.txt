```
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve global memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Perform loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead and increase ILP
// Ensure grid and block dimensions optimize the use of available SMs
// Utilize appropriate memory access patterns to take advantage of memory coalescing
