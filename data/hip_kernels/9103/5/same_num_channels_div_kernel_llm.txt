// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize global memory reads and writes.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Utilize vectorized data types for loading and storing multiple elements at once.
// Ensure the kernel is launched with optimal block and grid size configuration.
