```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses across threads.
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data to leverage L1 cache.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage.
// Try vectorized loads/stores to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize grid and block size for better occupancy and efficiency.
