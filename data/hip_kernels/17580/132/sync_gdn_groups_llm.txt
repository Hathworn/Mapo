```cpp
// Consider reducing global memory access by using shared memory
// Allocate shared memory to store intermediate results within blocks
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy
// Reduce synchronization where possible to minimize overhead
