// Use shared memory to load normalization factors to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesced memory access for normalization_factor to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling if there are additional computations on each pixel.
// Use __restrict__ with pointers if the data is guaranteed to not alias for better optimization.
