```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data, reducing global memory accesses.
// Consider coalesced access patterns for reading from and writing to global memory.
// Minimize divergent warp execution by ensuring branches are well-optimized.
// Ensure each thread accesses consecutive memory locations for optimal memory throughput.
