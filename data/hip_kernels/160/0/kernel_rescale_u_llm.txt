// Consider coalesced memory accesses for u_dev to optimize memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses if possible
// Ensure enough thread blocks to cover the occupancy for full device utilization
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling could enhance performance depending on compiler optimization
