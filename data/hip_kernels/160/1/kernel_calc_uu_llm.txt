```
// Coalesced memory access is achieved since threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure proper alignment of data in global memory to optimize memory transactions.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need to access the same data to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring threads within the same warp follow the same execution path.
