```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous threads accessing contiguous memory locations
// Minimize global memory accesses by loading data into shared memory, if beneficial
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to the data and its size
// Align data structures to ensure optimal memory usage and access patterns
```
