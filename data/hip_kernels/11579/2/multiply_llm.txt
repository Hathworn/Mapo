```c
// Use local variables to reduce register pressure.
// Store intermediate results in shared memory to decrease global memory access.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed their operations before accessing shared memory.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in contiguous patterns.
