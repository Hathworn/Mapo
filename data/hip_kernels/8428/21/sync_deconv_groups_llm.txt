```c
// Review memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory when possible
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to improve performance
// Ensure that no warp divergence occurs within this kernel
// Verify that all threads within a block are being utilized efficiently
```
