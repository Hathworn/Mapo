```
// Use shared memory to cache data within blocks for faster access
// Align data access to ensure coalesced memory transactions
// Optimize block size to exploit GPU architecture for better occupancy
// Consider using float3 instead of float4 for memory efficiency if alpha channel is not needed
// Avoid branching inside the kernel by using conditional assignments or predefined tables
