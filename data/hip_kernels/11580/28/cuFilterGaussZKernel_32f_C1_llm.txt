```
// Consider using shared memory to store a tile of src to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use float2 to load data in coalesced fashion if possible.
// Optimize for memory coalescing by aligning data accesses in contiguous memory blocks.
// Ensure the thread block size is a multiple of the warp size to avoid idle threads.
// Perform loop unrolling for the loop calculating Gaussian weights if kernel_size allows.
