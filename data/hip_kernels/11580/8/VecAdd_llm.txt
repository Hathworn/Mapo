```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure A, B, C are aligned in memory
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous data
// Minimize branch divergence within warp
// Utilize warp shuffling for data within the same warp
// Pre-fetch data to hide global memory latency
// Group memory operations to reduce instruction overhead
