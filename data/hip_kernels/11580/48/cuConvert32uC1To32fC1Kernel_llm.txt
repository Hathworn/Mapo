// Use shared memory for strided access to reduce global memory transaction count
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring aligned shared memory access for both src and dst
// Ensure synchronization (__syncthreads) occurs to prevent data races in shared memory
// Minimize branch divergence by limiting conditional statements within critical paths
// Adjust shared memory size (32x32) if necessary to match hardware constraints
