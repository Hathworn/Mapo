// Use shared memory to store intermediate values to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch values from global memory to reduce latency
// Coalesce memory access patterns to maximize memory throughput
// Ensure stride is correctly aligned to maximize memory coalescing
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data with read cache benefits
