```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads to memory addresses
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate values if necessary
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads within warp execute same path
// Reduce global memory access by using registers for frequently accessed variables
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve cache utilization
```
