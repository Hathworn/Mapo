// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within each block.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by structuring data and access patterns accordingly.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory to increase memory throughput.
// Reduce the number of redundant global memory transactions.
// Utilize vectorized memory loads and stores to improve memory bandwidth usage.
