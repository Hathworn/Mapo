```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes.
// Consider using float4 for source to leverage aligned memory access.
// Utilize shared memory to load data in blocks to reduce global memory access.
// Pre-load data into registers to minimize latency during computation.
// Ensure data access patterns remain consistent to fully utilize memory bandwidth.
