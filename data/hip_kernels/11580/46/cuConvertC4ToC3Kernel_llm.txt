```
// Pre-calculate indices to avoid redundant arithmetic operations
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing float4 and float3 with aligned indices
// Load float4 once to minimize read transactions and enhance throughput
// Use __restrict__ keyword to assist compiler optimizations for non-overlapping data
