```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider aligning data with memory coalescing to improve access efficiency.
// Experiment with different block sizes to achieve optimal occupancy and performance.
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize memory latency.
// Reduce register pressure by using local variables wisely.
// Ensure that loop does not suffer from branch divergence across different threads.
