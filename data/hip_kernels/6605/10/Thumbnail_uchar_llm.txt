```
// Use warp-level primitives to further reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using vectorized loads to improve memory throughput
// Coalesce global memory accesses to enhance memory bandwidth
// Implement loop unrolling if possible for iterative operations within the kernel
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed constants
