```
// Consider using texture cache for improved memory efficiency
// Prefetch texture data to shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __fdividef for fast division wherever applicable
// Inline calculation of scale factors to reduce repeated computations
// Consolidate texture fetch operations to leverage spatial locality
// Use shared memory to buffer frequently accessed data to minimize latency
// Optimize boundary checks to avoid redundant thread execution
