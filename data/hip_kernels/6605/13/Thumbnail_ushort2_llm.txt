```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency for histogram accumulation
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by using blockDim.x for localHist indexing
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize shared memory writes before reading
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized to reduce serialization
