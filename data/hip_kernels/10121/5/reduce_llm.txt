```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Align block size to power-of-two for better reduction performance
// Remove bounds check if the input size is guaranteed to align with blockDim.x
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() where possible to reduce synchronization overhead
// Prefer warp-level primitives for reduction inside a warp
// Avoid atomicAdd in global memory by performing a tree-based reduction across blocks
