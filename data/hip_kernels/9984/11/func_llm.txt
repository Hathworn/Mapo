```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory is used efficiently by maximizing occupancy
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory whenever possible
// Ensure all threads have loaded data before proceeding with computations
// Consider coalesced loads to improve global memory throughput
