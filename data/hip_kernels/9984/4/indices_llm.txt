```
// Precompute sqrt to avoid recalculation
// Removed __syncthreads(); as it is unnecessary in this context
// Consider using shared memory if sqrt values are reused across threads
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Check occupancy and adjust block size for better utilization
// Use printf only for debugging purposes, as it can affect performance
