// Optimize shared memory access to reduce bank conflicts
// Consider using 1D thread blocks for better memory coalescing
// Use loop unrolling for accumulation to reduce instruction count
// Optimize global memory access by using vectorized loads/stores
// Evaluate and adjust shared memory size for efficient memory usage
