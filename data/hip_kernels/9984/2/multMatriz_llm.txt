```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning threads with data layout
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring data accesses are within separate memory banks
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by reusing loaded data for multiple computations
// Optimize loop unrolling to maximize data reuse within shared memory
// Balance computation and memory access to optimize overall performance
