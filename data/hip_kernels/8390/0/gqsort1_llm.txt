```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring threads read contiguous data
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Explore loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure efficient global memory accesses by aligning data
// Evaluate if using shared memory could reduce global memory access frequency
