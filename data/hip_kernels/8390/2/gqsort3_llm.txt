```
// Use shared memory to improve performance by minimizing global memory accesses
// Load data into shared memory at the beginning to reduce redundant global memory reads
// Access shared memory within the loop to replace global memory accesses, reducing latency
// Ensure that the number of threads corresponds to the data size to efficiently use shared memory
// Consider further optimizing shared memory usage by minimizing its footprint
