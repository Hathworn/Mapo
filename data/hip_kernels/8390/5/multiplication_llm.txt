```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Load sub-matrix tiles into shared memory to optimize memory coalescing
// Ensure alignment of shared memory allocations to maximize bandwidth
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by adjusting tile dimensions if necessary
// Exploit loop unrolling in the tile computation loop for better performance
// Consider occupancy and register usage for optimal block size selection
