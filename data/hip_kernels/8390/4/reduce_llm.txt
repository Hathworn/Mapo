```
// Implement loop unrolling for the stride loop to reduce loop overhead.
// Use shared memory to decrease global memory access time during reduction.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider adding warp-synchronous programming to avoid __syncthreads() if possible.
