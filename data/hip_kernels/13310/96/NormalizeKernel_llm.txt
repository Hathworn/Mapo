```
// Use shared memory to store normalization_factor in blocks to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using float4 loads if data is aligned to enhance memory coalescing
// Group reads and writes to encourage memory coalescing
// Employ loop unrolling technique for better performance
// Check if using a different memory layout improves cache utilization
// Ensure optimal block size to maximize occupancy
