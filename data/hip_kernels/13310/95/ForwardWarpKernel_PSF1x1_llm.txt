```cpp
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring u, v, and src are accessed sequentially
// Minimize bank conflicts by using padding in array strides when possible
// Use shared memory to temporarily store frequently accessed data if applicable
// Optimize the use of shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads
// Adjust block size to achieve a better balance between occupancy and performance
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to minimize control overhead
// Use float2 operations where possible to capitalize on hardware acceleration
// Ensure atomic operations are absolutely necessary to avoid performance bottlenecks
