// Use coalesced memory access for loc_ to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure all threads access memory in a pattern that maximizes cache efficiency
// Consider padding shared memory if utilized, to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize instruction usage by minimizing arithmetic operations inside the loop
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize GPU occupancy and efficiency
