```
// Use constant memory to store frequently accessed data like `value` if it doesn't change
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and using shared memory
// Prefer accessing image elements with atomic operations if needed to avoid race conditions
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by organizing data properly
```
