```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed variables like src and normalization_factor.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns in contiguous memory.
// Reduce the use of atomic operations for performance by exploring parallel reduction techniques.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize the overhead of indirection and condition checking.
// Evaluate using texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of caching.
