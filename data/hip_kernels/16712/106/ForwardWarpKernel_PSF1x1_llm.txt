// Use shared memory for `u` and `v` to reduce global memory access
// Use shared memory for `src` to improve memory access times
// Consider using texture memory for `src` for better caching
// Explore cooperative groups for more efficient parallelism
// Use constant memory for `time_scale` as it doesn't change
