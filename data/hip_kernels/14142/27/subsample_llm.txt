```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for input and output.
// Use shared memory to cache input subregions to reduce global memory reads.
// Use loop unrolling for the inner loops to increase instruction throughput.
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries to optimize memory transactions.
// Precompute stride offsets to minimize arithmetic operations inside loops.
