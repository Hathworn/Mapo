```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses.
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring branches are well-predicted.
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size.
// Use vectorized memory operations if applicable for improved bandwidth.
