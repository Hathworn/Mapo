```
// Use coalesced memory access for gradInput and gradOutput
// Minimize redundant calculations by reusing values within loops
// Consider using texture memory for weight when it is read-only
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Evaluate grid and block dimensions for occupancy optimization
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance performance
