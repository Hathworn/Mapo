```
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce global memory access latency
// Use shared memory to further reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling to improve arithmetic throughput
// Evaluate whether using more threads per block might improve occupancy
