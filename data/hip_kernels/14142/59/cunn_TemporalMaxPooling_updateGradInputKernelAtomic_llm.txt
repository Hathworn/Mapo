```
// Move constants out of loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to minimize global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for gradInput, gradOutput, and indices
// Align memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure optimal occupancy by adjusting block size according to hardware specifications
