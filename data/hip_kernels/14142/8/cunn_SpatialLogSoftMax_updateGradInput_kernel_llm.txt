```
// Optimize global memory access by coalescing the reads and writes
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Avoid divergent branches within the warp for better performance
// Minimize the use of expf by pre-calculating values where possible
// Use atomics for sum calculation if needed to ensure thread safety
