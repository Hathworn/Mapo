// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within each block.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced accesses for the input and output arrays.
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize thread divergence.
// Check if computation of linear index can be minimized or done outside of the critical path.
