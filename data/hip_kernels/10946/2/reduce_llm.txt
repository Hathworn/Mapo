```cpp
// Use thread coarsening to reduce loop iterations within a block.
// Try to access global memory in a coalesced manner.
// Ensure that `l2` is a power of 2 to optimize the reduction logic.
// Minimize synchronization by unrolling the loop when possible.
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for intra-warp communication to reduce shared memory usage.
