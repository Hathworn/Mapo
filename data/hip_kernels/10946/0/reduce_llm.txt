```
// Optimize global memory accesses by ensuring coalescing where possible.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory load latency.
// Consider reducing the number of necessary synchronizations if possible.
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a power of two for consistent parallel reduction.
// Explore possible techniques to minimize divergence within warp execution.
// Implement loop unrolling techniques to further optimize reduction steps.
