```
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize the number of divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Ensure memory access patterns coalesce where possible.
// Consider utilizing warp-level primitives to optimize the sorting operation.
// Investigate alternative sorting algorithms for potential performance improvements.
// Use constant memory if colorMode or THRESHOLD are frequently accessed and remain unchanged.
