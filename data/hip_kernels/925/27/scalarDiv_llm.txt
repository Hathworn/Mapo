// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring data is read/written in contiguous blocks.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses and improve memory bandwidth.
// Ensure that loads and stores are aligned to avoid bank conflicts and uncoalesced accesses.
// Optimize for memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
