// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning input array access with warp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Reduce synchronization by reorganizing the reduction pattern
// Minimize thread divergence for optimized performance
// Consider using warp shuffle for further reduction optimization
