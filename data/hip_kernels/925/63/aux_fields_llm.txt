```c
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access for px, py, pz.
// Use a loop unrolling technique for operations on similar data structures.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Reduce the number of frequent divisions by pre-computing reciprocal values.
// Optimize thread utilization by ensuring each thread does sufficient work.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses by properly aligning data.
// Explore warp-synchronous programming paradigms to improve performance.
