```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access for better performance
// Load data from global to shared memory to exploit data locality
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used after loading data to shared memory for synchronization
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access for improved throughput
// Consider the occupancy and adjust shared memory size according to the block size for optimal use
