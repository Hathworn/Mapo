// Reduce global memory access by using shared memory for frequently used data.
// Use constant memory for omega and dt if they remain unchanged throughout the operation.
// Minimize the number of arithmetic operations inside the kernel to reduce instruction latency.
// Coalesce memory access patterns to increase memory throughput.
