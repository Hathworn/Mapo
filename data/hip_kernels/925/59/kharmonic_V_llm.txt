```
// Use of registers to store item variables for reduced global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses where possible, e.g., x[xid], y[yid], z[zid], Ax[gid], Ay[gid], Az[gid], and V[gid]
// Consider shared memory for frequently accessed variables if there's data reuse within the block
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to improve cache efficiency
// Minimize divergence by ensuring branches within the kernel are uniformly followed by threads in a warp
