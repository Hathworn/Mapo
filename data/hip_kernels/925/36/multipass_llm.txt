```cpp
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better efficiency
// Ensure shared memory bank conflicts are avoided
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block
// Reduce unnecessary synchronization points
// Load and write operations should be optimized for memory bandwidth
// Leverage occupancy for optimal performance by tuning block and grid sizes
```
