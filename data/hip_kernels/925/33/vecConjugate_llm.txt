// Use memory coalescing by ensuring threads access sequential memory addresses
// Ensure threads operate within their own data blocks to minimize bank conflicts
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data within blocks
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better memory throughput and occupancy
