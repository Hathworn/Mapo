// Consider using shared memory to store commonly accessed values.
// Optimize memory access patterns to avoid strided access.
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Explore the use of registers for frequently used variables.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
