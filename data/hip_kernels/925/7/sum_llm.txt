```
// Use shared memory to cache data from global memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Consider loop unrolling if there are repetitive independent operations for potential increase in throughput
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize GPU occupancy and minimize warp divergence
// Use __ldg() to load read-only data for potential performance improvement on supported CUDA hardware
