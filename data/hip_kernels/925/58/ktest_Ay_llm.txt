```
// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Optimize block and grid size configuration based on the hardware and problem size for better memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store common data accessed by multiple threads within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure that data types are aligned for better memory access efficiency.
// Assess the possibility of loop unrolling or restricting data type usage for better kernel performance.
