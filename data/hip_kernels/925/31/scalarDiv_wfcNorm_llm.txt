```
// Consider caching pSum[0] in shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for in and out arrays
// Consider using __restrict__ to limit pointer aliasing
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimal for the GPU architecture
// Align data structures to improve memory access speed
