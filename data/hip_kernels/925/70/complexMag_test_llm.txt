// Use coalesced global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for further optimization
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop for better warp execution efficiency
// Ensure data alignment to avoid unnecessary memory transaction overheads
