```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Load data into shared memory in chunks for coalesced access
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed the limit per block
// Consider unrolling loops for better performance
// Synchronize threads after shared memory operations to avoid race conditions
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to minimize overhead
