// Consider coalescing memory accesses for x, y, and z arrays to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to store pre-fetched data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Evaluate unrolling loops for blocks to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize data alignment to ensure efficient memory transactions.
// Explore minimizing register usage by optimizing variable scopes.
