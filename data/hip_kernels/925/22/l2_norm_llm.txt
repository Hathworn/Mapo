```cpp
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory elements.
// Use shared memory for temporary storage if the kernel reuses data.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned for optimal throughput.
// Avoid branch divergences within the warp while executing the kernel.
```
