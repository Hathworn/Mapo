```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads to access consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive calculations to reduce instruction overhead
// Optimize registers usage by minimizing the use of local variables
// Evaluate use of warp-level primitives to further optimize data exchange within a warp
