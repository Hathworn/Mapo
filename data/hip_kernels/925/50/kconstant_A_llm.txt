// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefer coalesced memory access patterns to enhance memory throughput
// Minimize branch divergence by simplifying conditional logic where possible
// Consider loop unrolling for small loops to reduce overhead and improve throughput
