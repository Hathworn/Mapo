```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently used items array for faster access
// Precompute and store 1 / (items[i] * items[i]) in a shared variable for reuse
// Use constant or texture memory for the 'items' array if these values do not change frequently
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to enhance parallel execution
// Consider unrolling loops for better performance, if applicable
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory latency
