```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store input data temporarily to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize latency
// Ensure kernel launches with a configuration that maximizes occupancy
// Check for proper memory alignment to avoid uncoalesced accesses
// Assess the need for loop unrolling if applicable
