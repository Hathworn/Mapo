```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by arranging data linearly
// Minimize shared memory usage unless it is necessary for complex calculations
// Consider using loop unrolling if the data size is known at compile time
// Prefetch data to L1 cache if the compiler and architecture support it
// Monitor memory access patterns and reduce bank conflicts in shared memory
// Evaluate and optimize the occupancy by adjusting block and grid sizes
