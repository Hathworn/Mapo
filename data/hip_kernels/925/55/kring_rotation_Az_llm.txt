// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider data prefetching techniques to hide memory access latency.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures properly.
// Avoid unnecessary memory operations within the kernel by minimizing global memory accesses.
// Optimize the block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy without causing excessive memory usage.
