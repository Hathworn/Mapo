// Reuse common subexpressions to minimize redundant calculations
// Reduce number of operations by pre-computing constant values
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access
// Maximize usage of registers to store frequently accessed variables
// Improve data locality by loading data into shared memory if beneficial
