// Use shared memory for 'in' and 'evolution_type' to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for 'in', 'evolution_type', and 'out'.
// Increase block size for better workload distribution and higher occupancy.
// Minimize divergent branches in 'make_complex' by restructuring conditional logic.
