// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to achieve better performance.
// Investigate the use of shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Analyze the grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and efficiency.
// Utilize vectorized memory operations if the hardware supports it.
