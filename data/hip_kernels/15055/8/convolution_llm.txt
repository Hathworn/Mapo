```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data tiles for threads
// Optimize memory access by coalescing loads from inData
// Minimize redundant calculations of cx and cy by pre-computing them outside the inner loop
// Utilize constant memory for kernel if kernel is small and known at compile time
// Reduce bank conflicts by ensuring appropriate padding of shared memory arrays if used
```
