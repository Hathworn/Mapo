```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Perform coalesced memory accesses when reading "u" and "v"
// Use loop unrolling for predictable patterns within pixel updates
// Optimize atomic operations by reducing contention through cooperative thread approaches
// Align data structures to memory boundaries for faster access
