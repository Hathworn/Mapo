```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning atomic operations in continuous memory blocks.
// Use memory access patterns that favor coalesced reads and writes.
// Evaluate if the use of shared memory could reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling in the nested loops for potential performance gains.
// Check if atomic operations are necessary and if they can be replaced with reduction techniques.
// Minimize bank conflicts by adjusting thread block dimensions or memory access offsets.
// Investigate potential use of warp-level primitives for operations.
// Profile memory bandwidth and optimize access where contention is identified.
// Assess padding strategies that may align memory access patterns favorably.
// Utilize compiler flags that focus on optimizing memory throughput and access patterns.
