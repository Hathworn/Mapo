```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure shared memory size is sufficient for the block's processing.
// Use __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions when accessing shared memory.
// Organize memory access patterns to coalesce global memory reads.
// Balance workload among threads to maximize occupancy.
// Experiment with block and grid sizes to optimize performance based on hardware.
