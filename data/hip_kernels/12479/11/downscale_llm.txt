// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Check for opportunities to reduce the number of atomicAdd operations
// Utilize loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reductions to improve performance
