```
// Align memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Minimize pointer arithmetic by calculating offsets outside the loop
// Increase data locality by using shared memory where possible
// Unroll inner loops to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Prefetch gradOutput data to registers to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure thread block dimensions are optimal for the target architecture
