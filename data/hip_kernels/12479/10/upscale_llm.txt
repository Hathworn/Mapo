```
// Consider coalesced memory access by adjusting data layout if possible.
// Ensure input and output arrays are aligned to improve memory access performance.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions if data reuse is possible.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by appropriately aligning memory accesses.
// Leverage memory prefetch where feasible to hide memory latency.
