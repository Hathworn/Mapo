```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for d_MSD values.
// Consider coalesced access patterns for d_FIR_input and d_SNR_output.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Minimize divergence caused by branch instructions.
// Precompute invariant expressions outside of loops, especially those involving pos_x and pos_y.
// Align memory accesses to ensure peak performance.
// Use thread synchronization to manage shared memory if needed.
