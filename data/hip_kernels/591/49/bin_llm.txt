```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory transactions for binning operation
// Consider launching enough threads to fully occupy the GPU and hide latency
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts to maximize throughput
// Align memory accesses to leverage faster memory paths
