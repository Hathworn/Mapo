// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access times
// Preload MSD_DIT_widths into shared memory if it is frequently accessed
// Align data access patterns to warp boundaries to minimize bank conflicts
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve throughput
// Ensure variable initializations prevent uncoalesced access
