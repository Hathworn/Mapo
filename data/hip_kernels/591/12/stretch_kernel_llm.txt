```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize memory latency
// Utilize vectorized memory loads/stores if possible to increase efficiency
