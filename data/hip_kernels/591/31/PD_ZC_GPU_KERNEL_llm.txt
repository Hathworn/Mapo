```
// Move y_r calculation inside loop if dynamic and dependent on f
// Ensure x_r_base is coalesced for global memory read
// Align x_w_base to maximize memory throughput
// Reduce register pressure by simplifying x_w calculation
// Consider using shared memory for repeated data access
// Evaluate warp divergence from condition and optimize
