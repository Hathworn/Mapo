```
// Avoids out-of-bounds access by checking index
// Moved cutoff calculation inside loop to avoid recalculation
// Use faster sqrtf function for single precision calculation
// Consider coalesced memory access by adjusting data layout
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory if possible
// Reduce the impact of memory latency by unrolling loops
