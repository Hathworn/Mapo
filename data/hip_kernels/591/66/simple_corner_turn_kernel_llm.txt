```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for faster access
// Align memory access patterns to take advantage of coalesced memory access
// Use __ldg intrinsic function for read-only data to optimize memory bandwidth
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid bank conflicts
// Evaluate using larger thread blocks to increase occupancy
// Consider loop unrolling for potential instruction level parallelism
