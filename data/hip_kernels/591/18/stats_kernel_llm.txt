```
// Use shared memory to store partial sums to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by structuring loops properly
// Leverage warp-level primitives for reduction when optimizing further
// Optimize shared memory access by avoiding bank conflicts
// Balance computation and memory operations for efficiency
