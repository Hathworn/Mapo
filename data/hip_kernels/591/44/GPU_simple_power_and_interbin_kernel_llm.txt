// Use shared memory to store d_input_complex for coalesced access
// Consider loop unrolling for operations involving A
// Minimize repeated calculations for d_output_power index using precomputed variables
// Balance thread blocks for optimal occupancy
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory access latency
