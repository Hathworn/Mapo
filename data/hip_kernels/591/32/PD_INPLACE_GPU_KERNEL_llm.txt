```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Preload data into shared memory where possible to hide global memory latency.
// Align memory accesses to 32-byte boundaries when possible for optimal performance.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper access patterns.
// Optimize loop unrolling for the main computation to reduce loop overhead and enhance ILP (Instruction-Level Parallelism).
// Ensure that the work per thread is balanced to prevent idle threads within a warp.
