// Precompute commonly used values outside the loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Unroll loop for better performance if iterations are small, enhancing instruction-level parallelism
// Compute write index outside conditional checks for potential reuse and reduced overhead
// Perform memory sharing efficiently to optimize memory access patterns and enhance coalesced access
