```
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Implement warp-level primitives for more efficient reduction operations.
// Check if vectorized memory loads and stores can be applied.
// Ensure that memory accesses are within aligned boundaries for better performance.
// Analyze if occupancy can be improved by adjusting block and thread configurations.
