```
// Use shared memory for reduction to minimize global memory accesses
// Perform reduction within a block to reduce global memory usage
// Synchronize threads to ensure memory consistency after each reduction step
// Accumulate partial sums within shared memory for faster computation
// After reduction, write the result to global memory only once per block
