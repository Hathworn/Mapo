```
// Use shared memory for caching frequently accessed data
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth
// Align data in memory to ensure coalesced access
// Use float4 to load/store data when applicable for more efficient memory access
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Launch kernels with optimally sized thread blocks for maximal occupancy
// Minimize divergent branches within warps
// Minimize global memory accesses by utilizing registers efficiently
// Use asynchronous memory operations where possible
// Employ __restrict__ keyword for pointers to enable the compiler to optimize memory accesses
// Avoid using magic numbers; define constants for clarity and maintainability
