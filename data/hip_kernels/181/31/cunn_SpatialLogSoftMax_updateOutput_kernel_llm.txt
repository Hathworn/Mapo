```
// Use shared memory to store partial results to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce latency in reduction operations
// Investigate using half precision for storage if precision allows
// Align accesses to ensure proper cache line usage
```
