```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider aligning data to optimize for cache usage.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access within the kernel.
// Ensure all data is coalesced when accessing global memory.
// Avoid divergent branches to maintain warp execution efficiency.
// Profile memory access patterns to identify further bottlenecks.
