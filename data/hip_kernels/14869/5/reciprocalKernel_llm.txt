```
// Consider using shared memory for data if there's reuse across threads
// Align data access for coalesced memory reads
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing data layout
// Profile memory access patterns to ensure efficient use of L2 cache
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to optimize memory reads if applicable
// Reduce memory access latency by prefetching data into registers
