```
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize memory transactions
// Ensure data alignment for faster memory access
// Evaluate usage of shared memory if frequently accessed data is reused
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for further performance gains
// Ensure optimal grid and block dimensions to maximize device occupancy
