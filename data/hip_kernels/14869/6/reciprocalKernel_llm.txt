```
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access memory in a linear and contiguous manner.
// Minimize memory divergence by restructuring data access patterns to avoid conditional branches.
// Ensure optimal block and thread dimensions to fully utilize the GPU resources.
// Use shared memory if possible for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access overhead.
// Preload data into registers where appropriate to minimize repeated global memory accesses.
