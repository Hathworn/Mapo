```
// Consider using shared memory to cache sub-matrices of 'da' and 'db' to reduce global memory access.
// Implement loop unrolling on the 'k' loop to improve performance by enhancing instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize memory access patterns to use coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Ensure 'num' is a multiple of block dimensions to prevent unnecessary thread execution.
