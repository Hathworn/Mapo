// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access  
// Optimize memory coalescing by accessing memory in a sequential manner  
// Ensure synchronization after loading data into shared memory  
// Limit the use of __syncthreads to necessary points to reduce overhead  
// Reduce global memory access by reusing shared memory for accumulations
