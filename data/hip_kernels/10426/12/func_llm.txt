```
// Consider coalesced global memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Leverage shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure shared memory is accessed in a coalesced manner to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize the reduction pattern to utilize warp-level primitives if possible
// Consider using more threads and blocks for better parallel efficiency and load balancing
// Ensure global memory writes are minimized and coalesced for optimal performance
