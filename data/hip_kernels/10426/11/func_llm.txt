// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning accesses
// Minimize usage of atomic operations to avoid performance bottlenecks
// Consider loop unrolling techniques where applicable
// Utilize occupancy calculator to find optimal block and grid size
// Ensure bank conflict free access patterns in shared memory
