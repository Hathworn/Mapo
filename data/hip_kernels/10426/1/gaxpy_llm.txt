```
// Consider coalesced memory access for a[bid * n + tid] to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Load x[tid] into a register to decrease global memory access latency.
// Reduce the use of shared memory by optimizing the reduction step.
// Decrease synchronization overhead by utilizing warp shuffle operations for reduction.
// Explore using __restrict__ pointers to improve memory access pattern predictability.
