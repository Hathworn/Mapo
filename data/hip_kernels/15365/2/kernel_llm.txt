```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches within warps to improve efficiency
// Use vectorized memory accesses if possible to increase bandwidth
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data
// Check for memory alignment to prevent potential performance issues
