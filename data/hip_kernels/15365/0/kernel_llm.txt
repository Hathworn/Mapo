```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive threads to consecutive memory locations
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores if operations are on contiguous memory and data supports it
// Minimize thread divergence by avoiding warp-conditional execution paths
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to help compiler optimize memory accesses
