```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use warp-shuffle operations for data exchange if supported, to reduce shared memory usage and synchronization
// Minimize branching and divergent paths within the kernel
