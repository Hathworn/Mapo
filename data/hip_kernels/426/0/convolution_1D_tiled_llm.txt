// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data addresses
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize shared memory access patterns to prevent bank conflicts
// Load contiguous blocks of data into shared memory
// Minimize branch divergence in boundary checks when loading into shared memory
