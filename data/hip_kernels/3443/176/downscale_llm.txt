```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize divergent branches to retain optimal warp execution efficiency
// Ensure the use of `__restrict__` qualifiers where applicable to aid compiler optimizations
