```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for gradOutput_data
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Leverage memory coalescing by ensuring gradOutput_data accesses are sequential
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy and performance
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop with scale_factor if performance gains are observed
