// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to reduce global memory access time
// Try using shared memory to improve access latency and reduce bandwidth pressure
// Assess the use of atomic operations to avoid unnecessary serialization and improve parallelism
// Ensure proper memory alignment and padding to minimize memory access overhead
