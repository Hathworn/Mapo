```
// Consider using warp-level primitives for direct warp reduction to avoid excessive __syncthreads()
// Evaluate using atomics for reduction to potentially simplify code and improve parallelism
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning input data properly
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by carefully organizing access patterns
// Explore using fast math operations to increase computation speed
