```
// Optimize memory access by considering coalesced memory access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to the same data.
// Experiment with increasing the block size to maximize warp occupancy.
// Assess if memory padding can avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Investigate if loop unrolling could reduce pipeline stalls.
