```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a contiguous manner
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if applicable to help compiler optimize for potential aliasing
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize thread block size for maximum occupancy on the specific GPU architecture
// Explore using float4 or other vectorized data types for better memory throughput if applicable
