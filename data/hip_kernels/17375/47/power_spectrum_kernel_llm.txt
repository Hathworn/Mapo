```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and accessing contiguous memory.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant loads and optimize memory bandwidth.
// Optimize loop by minimizing divergent branching, e.g., the special case handling for idx == 0.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to leverage L1 cache and optimize read performance.
// Minimize use of sqrtf and fabsf functions where possible to reduce computational overhead.
