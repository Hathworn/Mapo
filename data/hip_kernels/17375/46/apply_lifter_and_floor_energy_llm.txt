// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for lifter coefficients
// Use parallel processing for efficient application of lifter coefficients
// Ensure synchronization after loading lifter coefficients to shared memory
// Apply energy floor only in the first thread to minimize redundant computations
// Minimize warp divergence by limiting conditional operations inside the main loop
