```
// Consider using shared memory to load gradOutput_data into local memory first
// Implement register blocking to accumulate results for multiple iterations at once
// Utilize constant memory for repeated data access patterns to reduce memory traffic
// Try to use memory coalescing techniques to improve access patterns
// Apply warp-level optimizations such as warp divergence reduction
// Investigate possible use of asynchronous copies for latency hiding
// Ensure that memory access patterns are aligned for cache efficiency
