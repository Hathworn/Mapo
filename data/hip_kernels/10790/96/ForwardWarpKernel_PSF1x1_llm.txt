```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses for u, v, and src
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions if possible
// Ensure adequate occupancy to hide memory latency
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider using half-precision floats if acceptable by accuracy requirements
```
