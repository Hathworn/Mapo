```cpp
// Use shared memory to store normalization factors to reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for improved global memory throughput.
// Ensure that load and store operations are aligned to enable efficient memory transactions.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to keep warp execution efficient.
