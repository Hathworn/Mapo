```
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory accesses.
// The use of atomic operations can lead to serialization; explore reduction algorithms for performance improvements.
// Analyze memory access patterns for spatial locality to enhance cache efficiency.
// Adjust the block size to ensure a suitable occupancy and good utilization of GPU resources.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling on the pixel update sections could yield performance gains.
