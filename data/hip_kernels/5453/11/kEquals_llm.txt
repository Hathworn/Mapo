// Use coalesced memory access pattern for improved bandwidth utilization
// Prefer using shared memory for data frequently accessed by threads within the same block
// Consider using loop unrolling if operations inside the if statement are complex
// Minimize conditional branching in kernel to reduce warp divergence
