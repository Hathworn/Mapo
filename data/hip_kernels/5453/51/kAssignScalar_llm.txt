// Unroll loop to improve memory access efficiency and reduce loop overhead
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latencies
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to fully utilize the GPU resources and minimize warp divergence
// Evaluate using float4 for vectorized operations to potentially improve throughput
