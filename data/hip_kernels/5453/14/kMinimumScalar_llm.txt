```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Consider warp-level primitives for potential further optimization
// Ensure target array is allocated in optimal memory space for faster access
// Use __restrict__ keyword if applicable to exploit additional compiler optimizations
