```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory throughput.
// Ensure that the data is aligned to achieve optimal performance on the GPU.
// Use memory access patterns that minimize transaction overhead and maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize shared memory utilization to lower memory latency and improve performance.
// Explore the use of warp shuffle functions to reduce shared memory usage where possible.
// Consider reducing control divergence by restructuring the loop if feasible.
// Pre-fetch data into registers where beneficial to reduce memory access time.
