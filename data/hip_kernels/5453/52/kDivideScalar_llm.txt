```c
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by organizing data access in a sequential manner
// Consider using vectorized data types to enhance memory throughput efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel to maintain warp execution efficiency
// Adjust block size and grid size to maximize occupancy and balance memory bandwidth utilization
