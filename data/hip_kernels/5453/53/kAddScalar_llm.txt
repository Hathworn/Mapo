```cpp
// Use coalesced memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring data alignment for improved cache performance.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple accesses to the same data occur within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Make sure to use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable better compiler optimizations if no aliasing occurs.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling in cases of repeated operations could reduce instruction overhead.
