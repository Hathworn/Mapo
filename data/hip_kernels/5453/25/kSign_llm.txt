```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data if there are repeated accesses by multiple threads.
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure that the input is aligned to improve memory access performance.
// Minimize divergence by reordering operations to avoid branches.
