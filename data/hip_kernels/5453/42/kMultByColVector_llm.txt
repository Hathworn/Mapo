// Use shared memory to cache vec elements for better memory access patterns
// Try coalesced access patterns for mat and tgtMat to improve memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for the main computation to reduce loop overhead
// Optimize stride calculation by avoiding redundant recalculations within the loop
