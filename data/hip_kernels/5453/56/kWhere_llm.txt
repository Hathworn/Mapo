```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring aligned access patterns.
// Minimize bank conflicts if shared memory is used.
// Adjust block size to achieve maximum occupancy and improve performance.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to enable additional compiler optimizations.
// Explore asynchronous memory prefetching to hide latency.
