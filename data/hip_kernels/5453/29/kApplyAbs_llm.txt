// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring mat and target arrays are aligned
// Use suitable block size and grid size to increase occupancy and reduce divergence
// Experiment with different loop unrolling techniques for potential performance improvement
// Assess the use of shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if possible
