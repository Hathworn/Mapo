```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Use __restrict__ pointers if data does not alias
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimal for your hardware
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning conditional logic
// Use shared memory if accessing data reuse is possible
```
