// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within a block is possible.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for both reading 'mat' and writing 'target'.
// Determine if loop unrolling would benefit performance in this scenario.
// Optimize the block and grid dimensions to match your specific hardware.
