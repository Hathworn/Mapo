```c++
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Align memory accesses to boundaries that match cache line sizes
// Take advantage of memory access patterns to minimize cache misses
// Explore loop unrolling for potential performance gains
