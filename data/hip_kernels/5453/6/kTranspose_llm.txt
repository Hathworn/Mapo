```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by reading rows and writing columns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory load/store operations
// Padding shared memory to COPY_BLOCK_SIZE+1 prevents bank conflicts
// Synchronize threads before accessing shared memory to ensure all values are loaded
// Limit memory access conditions to ensure no out-of-bounds memory access
