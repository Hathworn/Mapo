```
// Consider pre-fetching data into shared memory for coalesced access
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal and does not exceed hardware limits
// Use __syncthreads to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory
// Explore using warp-level primitives for reducing synchronization overhead
// Ensure memory alignment to achieve coalesced global memory access
