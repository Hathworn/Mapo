```
// Consider coalesced memory access for the source array to improve performance.
// Utilize shared memory for the kernel to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Ensure memory access patterns are sequential to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize warp occupancy.
// Avoid divergent branching by minimizing conditional checks within loops.
