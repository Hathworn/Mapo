```c
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better throughput
// Ensure memory accesses are within a single warp's scope to avoid divergence
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find optimal occupancy
// Check for memory alignment to exploit potential coalesced access further
