```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing sequentially for each thread
// Minimize memory access latency by using shared memory if needed
// Consider using float4 for vectorized operations if applicable
// Optimize kernel launch parameters (block size) for better occupancy
// Use __expf intrinsic function for faster computation
