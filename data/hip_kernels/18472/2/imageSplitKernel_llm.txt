```c
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Pre-calculate commonly used expressions to reduce redundant calculations.
// Use shared memory if there is a possibility to reduce global memory access.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable, although not necessary here.
