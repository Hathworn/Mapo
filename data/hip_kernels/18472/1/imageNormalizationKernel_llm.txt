// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory addresses
// Utilize shared memory to store intermediate results for threads in the same block
// Reduce global memory accesses by performing operations in registers when possible
// Pay attention to memory bank conflicts when using shared memory
