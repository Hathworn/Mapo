```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for input and output arrays to improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed weights for better memory access performance.
// Ensure thread block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy and match the architecture's warp size.
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns and throughput.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for input and output pointers to enable better compiler optimizations.
