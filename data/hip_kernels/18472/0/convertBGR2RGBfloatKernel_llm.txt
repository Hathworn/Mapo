// Ensure memory access patterns exhibit coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory if there is an opportunity for data reuse
// Check if using vectorized loads/stores provides performance benefits
// Consider memory alignment for better memory performance
// Adjust block size for optimal occupancy and resource usage
