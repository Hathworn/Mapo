```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory reads from global memory.
// Consider using shared memory to optimize the memory access pattern.
// Use texture memory if possible for improved bandwidth and caching benefits.
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency.
