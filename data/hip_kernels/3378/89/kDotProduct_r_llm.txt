```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Utilize a local sum variable to minimize shared memory accesses
// Implement a stride access pattern to improve coalescing
// Apply warp-level operations for efficient parallel reduction
// Perform final reduction using warp shuffle for intrawarp communication
// Avoid excessive synchronizations by using warp-level operations
// Ensure volatile keyword for shared memory access in warp shuffle
