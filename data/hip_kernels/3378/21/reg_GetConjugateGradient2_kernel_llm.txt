```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory transactions if multiple threads access the same data.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied to accelerate the computations.
// Verify if using warp shuffle operations can optimize the reduction patterns.
// Assess if using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers could help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Review the possibility of employing mixed precision to enhance performance without significant loss of accuracy.
