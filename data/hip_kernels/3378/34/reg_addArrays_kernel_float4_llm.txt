```c
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory reads
// Align data structures to improve memory coalescing and reduce unaligned memory access penalties
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to improve occupancy and workload balance
// Consider loop unrolling if there are repetitive operations within the same thread
