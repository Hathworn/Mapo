```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache matrix tiles and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Use stride loops to enhance processor use and avoid warp divergence
// Assess block and grid size configurations for optimal occupancy
// Minimize divergence by aligning work division with warp size
```
