// Consider coalescing memory access for arrays x and y to improve global memory throughput.
// Ensure that data alignment is optimal for the GPU architecture to reduce memory access overhead.
// Evaluate using shared memory for frequently accessed data to decrease global memory traffic.
// Minimize use of atomic operations if possible to reduce serialization and improve performance.
