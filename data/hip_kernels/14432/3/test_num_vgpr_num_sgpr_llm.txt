```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use memory access patterns that avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize for the GPU architecture by aligning data structures.
// Minimize register usage to improve occupancy and performance.
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory transactions.
// Use warp synchronous programming to maximize data throughput.
// Unroll loops to reduce the overhead of branches and increase ILP.
// Consider using stream compaction techniques to handle divergent branches.
