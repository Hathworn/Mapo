```
// Consider using shared memory for more neighboring pixel values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from or writing to global memory.
// Utilize warp-wide synchronization to improve efficiency of shared memory usage.
// Evaluate the block size and grid size to optimize occupancy and reduce unnecessary computations.
// Consider using constant memory for frequently used constants such as Sobel operator coefficients.
