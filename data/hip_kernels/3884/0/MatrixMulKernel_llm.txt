```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns in global memory to maximize bandwidth.
// Consider loop unrolling within the tile computation loop for further optimization.
// Adjust TILE_WIDTH for a balance between memory usage and computation parallelism.
