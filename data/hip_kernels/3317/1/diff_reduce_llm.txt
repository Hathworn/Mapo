```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently used data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns to improve throughput.
// Evaluate using half precision for computations where precision loss is acceptable to improve performance.
// Minimize divergence by restructuring conditional statements if possible.
// Consider employing warp shuffle instructions for reductions to reduce shared memory usage.
