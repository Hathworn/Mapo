```
// Use shared memory to store the division factor to reduce redundant calculations
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded the division factor
// Calculate the global thread index to ensure correct data access
// Use loop unrolling for larger arrays to improve memory throughput
// Ensure correct alignment and coalesced memory access patterns
