```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed subblock information.
// Use a grid-stride loop to maximize occupancy and work distribution.
// Employ coalesced memory access by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Optimize atomic operations as they can be a bottleneck in performance.
// If possible, reduce the usage of atomic operations by improving memory access patterns.
