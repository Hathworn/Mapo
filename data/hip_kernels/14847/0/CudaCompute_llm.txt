```
// Load x_sub in coalesced manner for better memory access efficiency
// Consider using warp-level operations for atomicAdd to reduce contention
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses for commonly used data
// Investigate usage of vectorized operations to optimize data movement
// Ensure memory alignment for shared_mem to take advantage of hardware capabilities
