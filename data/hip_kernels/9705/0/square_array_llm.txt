// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latencies.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better memory efficiency.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy and minimal idle threads.
// Avoid unnecessary calculations inside the loop that can be done outside.
