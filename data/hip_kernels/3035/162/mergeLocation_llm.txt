// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize divergent branches to optimize warp execution
// Optimize use of __restrict__ pointers to help the compiler with memory optimization
