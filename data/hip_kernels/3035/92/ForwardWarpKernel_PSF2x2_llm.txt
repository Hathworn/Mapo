```cpp
// Use __restrict__ pointers for potentially improved memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within each kernel block
// Prefetch data to minimize the impact of global memory latency
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Align data access to the warp size to increase memory throughput
// Combine atomic operations if possible to reduce contention
// Use float4 for coalesced memory access if multiple contiguous float values are read/written together
// Ensure data is allocated with proper alignment to avoid uncoalesced access
```
