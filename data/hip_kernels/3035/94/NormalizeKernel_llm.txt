```
// Use shared memory to cache normalization_factor into lower latency memory.
// Prefetch normalization_factor[pos] to registers to reduce memory latency.
// Consider using loop unrolling for better performance in the calculation.
// Minimize divergent branching by avoiding unnecessary conditionals.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the image array to improve throughput.
