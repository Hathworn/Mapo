```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses in the loop for improved performance.
// Optimize global memory accesses by ensuring data is co-located, reducing cache misses.
// Utilize shared memory for accumulating scores to reduce repeated global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure alignment of data to enable faster memory access patterns.
