```
// Ensure that input and weight are coalesced by aligning access patterns
// Use __restrict__ keyword for input, weight, and score pointers to increase optimization potential
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for reduction to reduce __syncthreads usage
// Reduce shared memory usage by ensuring MV_BUFFER_SIZE is as small as possible
// Consider double buffering in shared memory to hide latency
// Use float4 or similar data types for input and weight to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Prefetch data from input and weight to shared memory to reduce global memory latency
