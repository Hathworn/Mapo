// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for input arrays.
// Try to optimize memory access for 'target', 'mapping', and 'n_class_in_cluster'.
// Ensure memory alignment for output arrays to improve access speed.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for the 'score' variable within a block.
// Investigate if prefetching of 'logsum_k' can minimize latency.
// Evaluate the impact of warp-level primitives instead of explicit synchronization points.
