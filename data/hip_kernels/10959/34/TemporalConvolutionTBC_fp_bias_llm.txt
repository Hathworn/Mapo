// Consider optimizing memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed variables.
// Reduce global memory accesses by preloading bias[x] into a register before the loop.
// Explore the possibility of using warp-level primitives for coalesced memory accesses.
// Verify the kernel launch configuration to ensure that blockDim.x and gridDim.y are appropriately set for the hardware.
