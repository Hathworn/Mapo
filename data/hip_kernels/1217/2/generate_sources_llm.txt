```
// Ensure data is coalesced by having contiguous thread IDs access contiguous memory locations.
// Minimize branching inside the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Use shared memory if there are frequent redundant global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of the loop control statements.
// Try to maximize occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size.
// Avoid using global memory for intermediate variables, use registers instead.
