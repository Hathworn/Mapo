// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory throughput.
// Use memory prefetching if possible to overlap computation and data transfer effectively.
// Minimize the number of accesses to global memory by reusing data stored in registers.
