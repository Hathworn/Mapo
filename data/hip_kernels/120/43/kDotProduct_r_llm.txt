// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses, improving memory efficiency.
// Load data in chunks to maximize L1 cache utilization and reduce global memory traffic.
// Perform reduction using unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve occupancy.
// Utilize warp-synchronous programming to optimize the final reduction steps.
// Write results from shared memory to global memory in a coalesced manner.
