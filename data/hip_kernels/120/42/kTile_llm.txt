```
// Use shared memory if applicable to store part of the src matrix for faster access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for both loading from src and storing to tgt.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for src if there's significant reuse of data.
// Consider launching with thread block dimensions that match the warp size for efficiency.
