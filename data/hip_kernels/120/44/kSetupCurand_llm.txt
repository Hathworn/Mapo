```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring hiprandState is accessed coalesced
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage if applicable
// Consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization and data sharing
// Utilize appropriate block and grid sizes for better occupancy and resource utilization
// Ensure seed value is varied enough to generate diverse random numbers
