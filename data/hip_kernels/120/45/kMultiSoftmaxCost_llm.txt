// Consider coalescing memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Implement shared memory usage for caching frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Use loop unrolling for the for-loop iterating over numOut to enhance performance.
// Consider using registers for frequently accessed variables to minimize memory operations.
