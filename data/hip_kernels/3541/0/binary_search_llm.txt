```c
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structure
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable for further optimization
// Minimize divergent branches in the search algorithm for better warp efficiency
// Optimize conditional statements to reduce execution time
```
