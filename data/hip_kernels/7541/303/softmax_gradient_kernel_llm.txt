```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to optimize cache usage.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for Y, dY, and dX arrays.
// Consider using shared memory to store the entire reduction_buffer to minimize global memory access.
// Explore the use of __shfl_xor for warp-level reduction to potentially increase performance.
// Review the occupancy and ensure blockDim is maximizing GPU utilization.
