```
// Consider using shared memory to cache a tile of the source to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by processing contiguous chunks of memory where possible.
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Ensure enough blocks are launched to fully utilize the GPU's resources for better parallelization.
