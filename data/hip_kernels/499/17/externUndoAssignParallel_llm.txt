```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data such that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider utilizing shared memory if frequently accessed data is needed within a block.
// Use warp-synchronous programming to reduce overhead from divergent branches.
// Optimize grid and block size configuration to maximize occupancy and efficiency.
// Employ __restrict__ pointers if no aliasing to help the compiler with optimizations.
// Profile the usage of atomic operations, as they can create serialization points and affect performance.
