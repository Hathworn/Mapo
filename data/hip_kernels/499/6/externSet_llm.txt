```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider using vectorized memory access patterns to improve throughput
// Optimize memory allocation by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Use loop unrolling techniques to enhance parallel execution
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring conditional statements are optimized
// Reduce memory footprint by using half-precision arithmetic if applicable
