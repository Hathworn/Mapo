```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency if there are shared computations.
// Utilize warp shuffle functions for intra-warp communications to optimize performance.
// Ensure nounce variable does not cause bank conflicts if shared in any manner.
// If possible, increase the number of iterations processed per thread to reduce overhead.
// Consider increasing occupancy by optimizing register and shared memory usage.
