```
// Use coalesced memory access to optimize memory fetching
// Consider shared memory usage if data reuse among threads in a block is possible
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Align memory allocations to improve access speed
// Ensure data alignment to avoid misalignment penalties
