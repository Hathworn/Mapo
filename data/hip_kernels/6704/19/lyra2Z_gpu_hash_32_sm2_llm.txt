```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by using shared memory
// Align data accesses to improve memory coalescing
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
// Ensure g_hash and resNonces are accessed in a coalesced manner
// Investigate potential use of shuffle intrinsics to reduce shared memory usage
