```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to g_hash by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied if there are loops in the hash computation for better performance.
