```
// Optimize memory access patterns to enhance coalescing for global memory
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
// Ensure that data is aligned appropriately to avoid misaligned memory accesses
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency
