// Cache Ad[tx] value to reduce global memory accesses.
// Perform computation on cached value to minimize global memory usage.
// Reduce redundant global memory updates in the inner loop.
// Consider using __shared__ memory for frequent updates within the loop.
// Minimize the number of threads performing memory access checks for better performance scalability.
// Optimize memory coalescing for Ad and Bd access patterns.
