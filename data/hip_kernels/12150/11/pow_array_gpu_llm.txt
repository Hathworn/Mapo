```c
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse if multiple threads access similar data
// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory throughput
// Ensure that the block size is a power of two for optimal occupancy
// Avoid divergent branches by ensuring that all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider unrolling the loop for powers known at compile time to reduce loop overhead
// Prefetch data into registers if there is a possibility of memory access latency
