```cpp
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by proper indexing in global memory.
// Implement loop unrolling for performance gains in the reduction step.
// Synchronize threads after shared memory operations to maintain data consistency.
// Use defined constants to handle edge cases and reduce conditional overhead.
