```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to enhance coalesced memory access
// Ensure that shared memory usage does not exceed available resources to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider unrolling loops if possible to reduce loop overhead
// Prioritize reducing global memory accesses by maximizing shared memory utilization
