```
// Reduce global memory access by storing frequently accessed data in registers
// Eliminate bank conflicts in shared memory access to optimize performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput
// Minimize the use of divergent branches inside the kernel
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize threads only when necessary
