```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for coalesced access
// Ensure data is stored in a manner that maximizes memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if applicable
// Optimize thread block size for better resource utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory
