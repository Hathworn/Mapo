```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize memory latency
// Align memory accesses to ensure coalesced memory operations
// Use asynchronous memory copy where possible to overlap computation and data transfer
// Evaluate the use of higher occupancy configurations for better warp execution efficiency
