```
// Avoid bank conflicts: use padding in shared memory allocations
// Minimize global memory access: prefetch data into shared memory
// Coalesced memory access: ensure contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Utilize atomic operations to prevent race conditions
// Optimize occupancy: adjust block size and thread count for GPU architecture
// Reduce divergent branches: streamline loops and conditional operations
// Use __forceinline__ for frequently called device functions to reduce overhead
// Leverage warp-level operations for faster synchronization
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory transactions
