// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Synchronize threads after loading data to shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and increase efficiency
// Investigate potential for mathematical simplification to minimize operations
