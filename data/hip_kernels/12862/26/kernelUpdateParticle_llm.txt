```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads' data access patterns
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same gBest value to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if the operation on each element can be simplified
// Minimize branching to improve warp execution efficiency
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid bank conflicts
// Use constant memory for variables like d_OMEGA if they don't change during the kernel execution
