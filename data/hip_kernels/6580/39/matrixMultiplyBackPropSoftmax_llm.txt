```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for A and B to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider using float4 to load/store if possible for better memory access.
// Ensure shared memory access patterns avoid bank conflicts.
// Utilize occupancy calculator to maximize block size for best performance.
// Minimize __syncthreads() as much as possible to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Pre-fetch or double-buffer tiles to hide memory latency.
