// Consider using shared memory to store 'predictions' and 'target' for coalesced memory access.
// Ensure that data in shared memory is accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Use loop unrolling for blocks to reduce overhead.
// Evaluate memory access patterns for efficiency and potential bank conflicts.
// Minimize redundant arithmetic by factoring common expressions.
// Verify that 'size' is correctly divisible by the number of threads for load balancing.
// Organize memory access to ensure maximum coalescence.
