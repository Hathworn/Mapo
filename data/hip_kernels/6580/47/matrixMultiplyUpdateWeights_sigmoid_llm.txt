// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory with linearized indexing.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for matrices A and B.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage by optimizing calculations within the shared memory.
// Utilize a more efficient algorithm or techniques to reduce thread divergence.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for better performance in matrix operations.
