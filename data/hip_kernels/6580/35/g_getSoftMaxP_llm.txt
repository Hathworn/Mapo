```c
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations.
// Use more efficient memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if double buffering in shared memory could improve performance.
// Explore coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Review if the grid and block dimensions are optimal for the problem size.
// Check if using half-precision can be beneficial with low precision demand.
