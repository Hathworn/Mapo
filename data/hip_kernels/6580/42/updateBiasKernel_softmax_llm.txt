```
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve global memory access patterns
// Use warp shuffle operations for more efficient intra-block reduction
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure block size is a multiple of warp size to optimize reduction
// Evaluate prefetching data to shared memory to reduce latency
