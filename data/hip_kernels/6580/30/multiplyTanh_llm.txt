```
// Consider aligning data to improve memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses if the data is reused within blocks
// Evaluate the effectiveness of loop unrolling depending on GPU architecture and data size
// Ensure coalesced access patterns to enhance memory throughput
