// Use shared memory to load tiles of matrices A and B for faster access
// Zero-padding boundaries in shared memory load to avoid invalid memory access
// Synchronize threads after loading shared memory to ensure all threads have completed loading
// Synchronize threads after computation within the tile to ensure all threads have completed calculations
