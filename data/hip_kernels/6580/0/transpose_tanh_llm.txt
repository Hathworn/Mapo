```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Align shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts.
// Employ __syncthreads() to ensure consistent shared memory operations.
// Consider using vector loads/stores to further optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance on idata.
