```
// Use shared memory to cache data if the access pattern is suitable
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved throughput
// Consider using __syncthreads() if synchronization is needed between threads
// Ensure appropriate launch configurations for the GPU architecture
// Unroll loops if applicable for performance gains
