```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for dZ to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache dZ data for the y dimension to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Check if loop unrolling for the x dimension summation can improve performance.
// Optimize thread block size and grid size to maximize occupancy and reduce latency.
