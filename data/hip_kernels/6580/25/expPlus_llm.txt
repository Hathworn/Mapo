// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Utilize shared memory if possible to further reduce global memory access
// Consider adjusting block and grid dimensions to achieve optimal warp utilization
// Implement loop unrolling for better throughput in scenarios where it is beneficial
