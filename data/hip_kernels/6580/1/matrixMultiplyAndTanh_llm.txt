// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads from A and B.
// Consider potential cache utilization improvements by adjusting tile size.
// Optimize memory access by ensuring all threads in a warp access contiguous addresses.
// Ensure shared memory is accessed in a non-bank-conflicting manner to improve performance.
// Experiment with different values for TILE_WIDTH to balance between occupancy and memory usage.
