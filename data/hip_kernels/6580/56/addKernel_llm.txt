// Consider coalesced memory access for A to improve performance.
// Ensure that global memory accesses are contiguous.
// Minimize bank conflicts by using shared memory where possible.
// Use memory padding if necessary to prevent access patterns leading to cache line thrashing.
// Optimize launch configuration by adjusting block size for better occupancy and efficiency.
