```
// Use shared memory to coalesce memory accesses for better performance.
// Apply sigmoid function when loading to minimize the computation in the critical path.
// Add padding to shared memory to prevent bank conflicts during access.
// Sync threads after loading data to guarantee all data is available before transposing.
// Perform transposed writes to global memory to minimize memory access latency.
