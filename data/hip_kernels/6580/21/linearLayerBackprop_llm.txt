```
// Consider using shared memory to cache W and dZ to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for W, dZ, and dA to improve memory throughput
// Verify boundary conditions are efficiently checked to prevent unnecessary computations
// Optimize loop unrolling for the accumulation loop to improve computational efficiency
