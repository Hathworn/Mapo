```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to minimize global memory transaction overhead.
// Ensure that shared memory usage is optimized to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use __ldg() for read-only cache loads if supported by the architecture.
// Optimize thread block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only variables.
