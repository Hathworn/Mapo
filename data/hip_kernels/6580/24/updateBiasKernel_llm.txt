```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory read efficiency.
// Use loop unrolling for further reduction operations to enhance performance.
// Ensure data is loaded into shared memory as efficiently as possible to minimize latency.
// Consider using warp shuffles for reduction within a warp to reduce the need for __syncthreads().
// Adjust the shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
