```
// Use shared memory optimally by minimizing bank conflicts
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for predictions and target arrays
// Consider larger block size for fewer blocks and better occupancy
// Explore loop unrolling to accelerate reduction
// Use float4 to load data if predictions and target are large and aligned
