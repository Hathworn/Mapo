```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for improved memory throughput
// Minimize use of atomic operations or use atomic functions efficiently
// Employ optimal block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Leverage shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure effective use of warp-level synchronization and primitives
