```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access speed
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for efficiency
// Preload to shared memory and use __syncthreads() correctly
// Use loop unrolling for better performance
// Use registers optimally within the loop
// Precalculate iteration counts to reduce computations
// Use boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds access
