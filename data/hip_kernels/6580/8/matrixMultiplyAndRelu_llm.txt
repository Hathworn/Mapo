// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure tiles are collaboratively loaded into shared memory to improve coalesced access patterns
// Leverage shared memory to perform matrix multiplication in tiles, minimizing register usage
// Optimize memory transfer from global to shared memory using conditional logic for boundary handling
// Employ __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within the same block, ensuring data consistency
