// Consider coalesced memory access for improved performance.
// Investigate shared memory usage to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Experiment with different block sizes to achieve optimal occupancy.
// Explore use of padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
