```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for reading from and writing to global memory.
// Ensure all threads within a warp access consecutive memory addresses.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate computations to reduce global memory accesses.
// Reduce the number of synchronization points to optimize thread performance.
// Apply loop unrolling for the reduction phase to reduce loop overhead.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper memory alignment.
// Consider optimizing the computation of maximum using warp reduction.
// Use __syncthreads wisely to ensure that synchronization occurs only when necessary.
