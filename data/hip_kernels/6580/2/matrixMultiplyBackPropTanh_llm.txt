```
// Consider using warp-level primitives for efficient data exchange within shared memory.
// Ensure bank conflicts are minimized by using padding if necessary.
// Check for alignment of memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Use inline PTX assembly if appropriate for critical sections of the computation.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost computation loop.
