```
// Optimize memory accesses by using shared memory if in1 and in2 are accessed multiple times
// Ensure coalesced memory access to enhance memory bandwidth utilization
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for better memory throughput
// Investigate warp-level primitives for potential reductions in divergent branching
