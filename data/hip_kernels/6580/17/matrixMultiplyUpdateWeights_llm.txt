```cpp
// Consider performing loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve execution efficiency.
// Ensure bank conflicts are minimized when accessing shared memory.
// Use constant memory for learning_rate if it remains unchanged throughout execution.
// Optimize memory coalescing by appropriately aligning global memory accesses.
