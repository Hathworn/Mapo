```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly for efficient global memory access
// Use float2 or float4 for vectorized memory access to increase memory throughput
// Avoid atomic operations for better performance by utilizing warp-level primitives
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing shared memory bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling for the reduction operations to reduce instruction overhead
// Evaluate whether employing hierarchical parallelism can enhance throughput for large data sizes
