// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to store frequently accessed small arrays such as d_state_supply.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like d_state_transition if it has high spatial locality.
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring aligned data access in shared memory.
// Use warp-level operations to reduce synchronization overhead and improve parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning d_text and d_out to avoid misaligned memory loads/stores.
