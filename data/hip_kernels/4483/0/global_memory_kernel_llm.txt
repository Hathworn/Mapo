// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the pitch calculation to minimize the overhead in GPU memory transactions.
// Ensure all read operations are coalesced to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
