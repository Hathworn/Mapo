// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to minimize global memory access latency
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce the number of reads from global memory
// Ensure memory coalescing for better performance
// Implement loop unrolling within the main computation to enhance execution speed
// Consider improving thread indexing for better data alignment
