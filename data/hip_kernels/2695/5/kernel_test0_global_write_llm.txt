```
// Consider increasing memory coalescing by aligning accesses for consecutive threads.
// Reduce memory bank conflicts by ensuring accesses are spread evenly across memory banks.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if patterns allow data reuse.
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency.
// Use loop unrolling if possible to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Ensure that any mask calculation minimizes warp divergence.
// Consider using atomic operations if memory write order matters and to avoid races.
