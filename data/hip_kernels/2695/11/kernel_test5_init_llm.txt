```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved performance
// Ensure memory access pattern is efficient to utilize memory bandwidth
// Consider using vectorized types for memory access if possible
// Pay attention to memory alignment to avoid misaligned accesses
```
