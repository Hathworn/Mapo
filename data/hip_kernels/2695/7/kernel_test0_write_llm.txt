```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning memory accesses in warp
// Use shared memory where possible to reduce global memory access time
// Minimize divergent branches within warps for better warp execution efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and increase ILP
