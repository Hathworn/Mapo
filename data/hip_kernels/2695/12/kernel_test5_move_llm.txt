```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for ptr and ptr_mid to increase memory throughput.
// Use __restrict__ keyword to indicate non-aliasing pointers and help compiler optimizations.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing bank conflicts.
// Ensure optimal grid and block size to maximize occupancy and performance.
// Evaluate using loop unrolling for the transformations if the loop count is known at compile time.
// Check if the __syncthreads() can be minimized or avoided for concurrency.
