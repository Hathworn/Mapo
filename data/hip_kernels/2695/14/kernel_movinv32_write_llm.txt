```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Consider unrolling loop to reduce instruction overhead
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous memory copies for overlapping computation and data transfer
// Ensure end_ptr is correctly aligned to prevent access violations
// Potentially reduce block size to increase occupancy if register usage is high
