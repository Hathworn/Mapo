```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved memory throughput
// Use shared memory if there are data reuse opportunities to reduce global memory access
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to improve efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp to improve performance
// Try using warp-level primitives to optimize conditional checks
```
