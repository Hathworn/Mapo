```
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by aligning data structures and access patterns
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring condition checks are uniform across threads in a warp
// Use shared memory when accessing frequently reused data to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction level parallelism
```
