// Consider optimizing memory access by using shared memory for common data across threads.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to improve cache efficiency.
// Inspect data alignment to enable coalesced global memory accesses.
// Check if bank conflicts in shared memory access can be minimized.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for efficient reductions.
