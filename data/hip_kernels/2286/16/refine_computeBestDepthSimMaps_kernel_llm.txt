```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by using contiguous memory storage.
// Align memory access patterns with data layout to ensure coalesced accesses.
// Utilize texture or __ldg for read-only data to improve cache hit rates.
// Implement shared memory usage to cache repeated data accesses within blocks.
// Reduce divergent warps by minimizing branching and using warp-synchronous programming.
// Optimize the use of registers by avoiding unnecessary variables and operations.
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed iteration patterns if applicable in your kernel.
