```
// Use register for accumulation to minimize shared memory usage
// Reduce the number of synchronization points for performance gain
// Use volatile for finer control at warp-level reduction
// Coalesce global memory writes by storing final results in blocks
// Ensure continuous access pattern in global memory for a and b
// Optimize loop by ensuring numCols is a power of two, if possible
