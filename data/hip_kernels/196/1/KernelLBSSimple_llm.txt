```cpp
// Use coalesced access to load data from global to shared memory for better memory utilization.
// Adjust chunk_size for optimal shared memory occupancy based on bCount and NT.
// Ensure __shared__ array is efficiently utilized to prevent bank conflicts.
// Consider further unrolling the loop that loads data into shared memory for performance gain.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize threads only when necessary.
// Look into reducing the __syncthreads() count if shared memory dependencies allow it.
// Unroll the loop with #pragma unroll when accessing the shared and global memory to enhance performance.
