```
// Consider using texture memory for imgIn for efficient read access
// Replace powf with faster approximations if precision allows
// Ensure blocks cover the entire image dimensions for full parallel execution
// Avoid redundant calculations outside critical functions like powf
// Use warp-level operations to optimize data movement between threads within the block
