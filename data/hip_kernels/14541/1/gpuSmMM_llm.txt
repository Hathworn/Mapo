// Consider using coalesced global memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure the matrices are properly aligned to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Try to overlap computation and memory transfer for better performance.
// Verify if loop unrolling improves the inner loop execution time.
