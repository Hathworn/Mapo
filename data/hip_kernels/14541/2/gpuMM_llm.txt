```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache A and B submatrices for better memory access patterns
// Optimize memory coalescing by ordering memory accesses in a contiguous manner
// Try loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Experiment with a larger block size for better utilization of GPU resources
// Analyze bank conflicts in shared memory accesses and optimize access patterns
