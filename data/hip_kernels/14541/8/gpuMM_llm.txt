// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for A and B when loading into shared memory
// Synchronize threads after loading data to guarantee all threads have completed loading
// Optimize the tile size for better use of shared memory and to minimize bank conflicts
// Include boundary checks for row and col during the C array write to avoid invalid memory access
