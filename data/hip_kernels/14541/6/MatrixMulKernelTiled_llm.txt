```
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced by checking boundary conditions
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses for tiles
// Synchronize threads to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory
// Careful unrolling of loops could further reduce computation time if applicable
// Consider adjusting TILE_WIDTH for optimal occupancy and performance on given hardware
