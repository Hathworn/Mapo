```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Load a block of data into shared memory to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that all threads in a block synchronize after loading data into shared memory.
// Optimize the number of tiles by considering memory coalescing for large matrices.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access for better performance.
// Validate boundary conditions to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
