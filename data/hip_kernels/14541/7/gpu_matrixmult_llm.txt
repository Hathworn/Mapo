// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for gpu_a and gpu_b.
// Align shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads to only when necessary.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed data if applicable.
// Optimize block and thread dimensions based on hardware capabilities.
