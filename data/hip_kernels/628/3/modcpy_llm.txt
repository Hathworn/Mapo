// Use shared memory if suitable to reduce global memory access latency
// Use vectorized types like int4 to maximize memory throughput when possible
// Ensure memory coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency when working on large datasets
// Experiment with varying block and grid sizes for optimal performance on specific GPU architecture
