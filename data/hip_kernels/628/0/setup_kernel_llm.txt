// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data access to 128 bytes to take advantage of coalesced memory access
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider employing loop unrolling for potential instruction parallelism improvements
