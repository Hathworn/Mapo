```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns for array
// Use appropriate memory hierarchy by utilizing __shared__ memory efficiently
// Avoid redundant __syncthreads() to minimize synchronization overhead
// Optimize loop unrolling for the reduction loop to enhance performance
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to reduce divergence
// Minimize bank conflicts in __shared__ memory access
// Adjust BLOCK_WIDTH and grid dimensions based on the target architecture
