```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for temporary storage.
// Consider increasing block width for better utilization of memory bandwidth.
// Reduce synchronization overhead by minimizing __syncthreads() calls.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_input and d_cdf arrays.
// Use bank conflict-free access patterns in shared memory.
// Investigate use of warp shuffle instructions for further optimization.
