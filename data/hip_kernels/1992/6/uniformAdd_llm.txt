```c
// Reduce global memory access by using shared memory for the 'uni' variable.
// Calculate address using blockDim.x for coalesced memory access.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded 'uni' before proceeding.
// Use local variable 'local_uni' to minimize redundant accesses to shared memory.
// Perform operations on data in a coalesced manner to improve memory throughput.
