```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory access patterns for vx and vy
// Minimize register usage by utilizing shared memory for common terms
// Consider loop unrolling to increase pipeline efficiency
// Utilize warp-based intrinsics for reduction operations to enhance parallel computation
// Prefetch data into registers to hide memory latency and improve throughput
```
