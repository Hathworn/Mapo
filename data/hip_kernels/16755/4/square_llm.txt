```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize the block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Apply loop unrolling if the operation inside the loop is small to reduce overhead
// Utilize asynchronous memory copy operations to overlap computation and data transfer
