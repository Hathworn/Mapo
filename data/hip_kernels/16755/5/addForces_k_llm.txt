```cpp
// Preload fj for reuse and reduce global memory access
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed variables to prevent repeated global memory access
// Compute tx and ty minus r outside the loop for efficiency
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access for all threads
// Consider using loop unrolling for predictable loops
