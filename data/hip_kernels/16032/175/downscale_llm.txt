```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses in the loop to improve memory bandwidth
// Use memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing loop variables or using __restrict__ pointers
// Prefer float4 or float2 if applicable for vectorized access
// Avoid branching within loops to improve thread divergence
// Increase thread block size if performance is limited by occupancy
// Analyze the warp execution efficiency for potential warp-level optimizations
