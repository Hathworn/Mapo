```
// Use __restrict__ pointers for dT_seq, dTrace, and dScore to improve memory access speed
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for dT_seq to improve performance
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to cache frequently accessed data from global memory
// Pre-load necessary data into registers to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to optimize the for loop iterations
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use warp shuffle instructions to reduce the need for shared memory where applicable
