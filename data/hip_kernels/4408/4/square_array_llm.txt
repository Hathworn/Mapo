```cpp
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by coalescing global memory loads and stores.
// Evaluate the shared memory usage to ensure it's not limiting occupancy.
// Unroll loops if it improves performance without affecting readability.
// Consider using vectorized operations if the hardware supports it.
