```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory if the same element is accessed multiple times by different threads
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring conditions are met by aligned data and thread structures
// Utilize loop unrolling techniques if possible to enhance throughput
// Balance the number of threads per block to fully utilize the GPU's compute capability
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for the hardware
