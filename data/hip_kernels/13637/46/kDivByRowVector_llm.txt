```
// Use shared memory to cache the row vector for coalesced access
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring linear memory access
// Combine multiple small kernels if possible to reduce kernel launch overhead
// Consider increasing block size if occupancy allows optimization
// Avoid bank conflicts while accessing shared memory
// Use constant memory for vec if it is read-only and fits in constant memory space
```
