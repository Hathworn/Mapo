```
// Optimize: Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize: Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance.
// Optimize: Consider using __restrict__ keyword if there are no pointer aliasing issues.
// Optimize: Use loop unrolling for the main computation loop to improve throughput.
