```c
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve memory access optimization
// Consider using coalesced memory access pattern for better performance
// Utilize shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory accesses
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to match the architecture's occupancy requirements
// Profile with different compiler flags for potential optimizations
```
