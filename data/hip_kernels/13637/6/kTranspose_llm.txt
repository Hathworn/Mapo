// Use __shared__ memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve latency.
// Prevent redundant calculations by moving index calculations out of boundary checks.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for both input and output operations.
// Synchronize threads after shared memory read to ensure correct data is written back.
