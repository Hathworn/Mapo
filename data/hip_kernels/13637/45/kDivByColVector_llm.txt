```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to optimize memory access.
// Ensure vec[colIndex] is loaded into a register to reduce memory accesses.
// Explore opportunities for coalesced memory access for mat and tgtMat.
// Optimize block and grid dimension to match the hardware's warp size.
// Use shared memory if repeated access to vec is significant across threads.
