```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data that is accessed frequently.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive data elements.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to leverage memory coalescing.
// Limit the use of conditional statements inside the kernel to improve performance.
// Consider the use of vectorized data types for better memory access efficiency.
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead.
