```c
// Ensure the kernel launch uses optimal block and grid sizes for the hardware
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns
// Minimize the use of divergent branches for better performance
// Use float4 or float2 to load data in a coalesced manner
