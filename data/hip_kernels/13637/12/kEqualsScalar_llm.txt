```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'mat' and 'target'
// Consider using shared memory if repeated access patterns are detected
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize device occupancy
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop
// Consider vectorized loads/stores for better memory throughput
