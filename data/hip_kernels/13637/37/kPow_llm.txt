// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.
// Evaluate the possibility of using texture memory for read-only data to possibly improve memory access performance.
// Analyze memory coalescing pattern to ensure aligned accesses and reduce transaction overhead.
// Place frequently used variables and constants in registers to minimize memory access latency.
// Consider optimizing the data type size or using half precision if applicable to enhance throughput.
