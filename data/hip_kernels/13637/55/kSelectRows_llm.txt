```
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure indices are loaded collaboratively to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Adjust negative indices efficiently to prevent out-of-bound errors.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading indices.
// Use thread-wise loop for column copying to maximize parallel execution.
