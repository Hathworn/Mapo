// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for the vector
// Reduce the number of calculations for thread indices
// Ensure sharedVec size fits within shared memory limits of the device
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory
// Improve coalescing by using stride to access matrix elements
