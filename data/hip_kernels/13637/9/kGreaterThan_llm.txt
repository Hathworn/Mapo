```cpp
// Align memory access to ensure coalesced reads and writes if possible
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Use vectorized loads and stores if hardware supports it
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp
// Ensure grid size is optimized to fully occupy the GPU hardware
// Profile memory transactions to identify bottlenecks
```
