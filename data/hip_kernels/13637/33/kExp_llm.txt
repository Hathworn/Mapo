```cpp
// Use a stride loop and shared memory for coalesced access
// Ensure grid and block size are optimized for GPU occupancy
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Consider using __expf for faster computation if high precision is not required
// Align data access to warp size for coalesced memory transactions
