```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures.
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse between threads is high.
// Ensure the selected stride covers all data for efficient utilization.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if data is not aliased.
// Check if vectorized memory access (e.g., float4) can be applied to improve bandwidth.
