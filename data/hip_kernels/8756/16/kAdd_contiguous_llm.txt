```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure arrays 'a', 'b', and 'dest' are aligned and sized for optimal coalesced access.
// Consider using shared memory if future operations involve reused data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Adjust block size to match specific hardware capabilities for optimal occupancy.
// Ensure data transfer to/from the device is performed efficiently, possibly using asynchronous copies.
