```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory transactions
// Optimize bank conflicts in shared memory for better performance
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration
// Utilize warp-level primitives for faster intra-warp communication
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization when possible to enhance performance
