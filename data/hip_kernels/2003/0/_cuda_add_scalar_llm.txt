// Ensure that threads access contiguous memory locations for coalesced memory access
// Pre-compute values like stride outside loops to reduce redundant calculations
// Simplify arithmetic operations when possible to increase execution speed
// Exploit warp execution by ensuring the number of threads is a multiple of the warp size
