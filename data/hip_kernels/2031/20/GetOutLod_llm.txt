```
// Use shared memory to store num_erased values to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access for in_lod and out_lod0 arrays
// Use loop unrolling if lod_len is known at compile time and is small
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to help compiler optimize
