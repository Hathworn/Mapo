```
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data for reduced global memory access.
// Vectorize memory accesses where possible to improve coalescing and reduce bank conflicts.
// Consider using atomic operations for thread synchronization instead of globalState writes.
// Optimize random generation by reducing repeated global memory reads.
// Consider using loop unrolling for loops with known iteration counts.
// Ensure memory alignment for data structures to prevent misaligned access penalties.
