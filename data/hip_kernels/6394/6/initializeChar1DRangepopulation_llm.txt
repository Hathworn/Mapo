```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for globalState, reducing global memory access latency
// Ensure minimal global memory access by caching to shared memory
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for intra-warp communication to enhance performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by proper allocation and access patterns
