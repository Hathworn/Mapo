```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory transactions.
// Ensure that data allocated for hiprandState is aligned properly to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use __syncthreads() if necessary to prevent race conditions when using shared memory.
