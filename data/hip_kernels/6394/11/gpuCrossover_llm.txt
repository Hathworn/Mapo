```
// Consider ensuring coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses across threads
// Use shared memory to store temporary results to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce repeated global memory access when possible
// Optimize the use of hiprandState to avoid potential bank conflicts
// Use a separate kernel for mutation to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure loop variables and indices do not cause unnecessary divergence among threads
// Minimize the number of global memory writes by combining them when possible
