// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads such that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Minimize the use of conditionals within the kernel to reduce warp divergence.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads within a block will use the same data.
// Investigate potential register pressure and optimize variable usage to prevent spilling.
