```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Evaluate the option of using shared memory to further reduce global memory latency.
// Analyze the loop for potential unrolling to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Check if memory access patterns allow for the utilization of texture or read-only cache for better performance.
