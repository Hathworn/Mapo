```cpp
// Make sure memory access is coalesced to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory if needed to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure all threads within a warp follow the same execution path to improve efficiency
// Utilize the grid-stride loop to ensure all elements are processed, even for large N
// Double-check that thread synchronization is unnecessary; avoid if possible to reduce overhead
