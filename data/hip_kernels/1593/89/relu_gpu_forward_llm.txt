// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations in the loop.
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve caching.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to optimize for the specific hardware architecture.
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives for additional performance gains.
