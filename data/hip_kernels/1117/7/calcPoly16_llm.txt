```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for faster access
// Minimize redundant calculations of 'res' by caching repeated values
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures
// Consider loop unrolling for constant-length loops to increase efficiency
// Optimize data dependencies to reduce thread divergence
