```c
// Use shared memory for data that is reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loading data into registers for each thread to minimize access latency.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns to improve global memory read/write efficiency.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization where possible to increase kernel performance.
// Profile the kernel to identify potential memory bottlenecks and adjust data layout accordingly.
