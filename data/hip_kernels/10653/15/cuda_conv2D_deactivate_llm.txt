```
// Ensure memory access coalescing by using appropriate memory layouts
// Consider using __ldg intrinsic for read-only data like 'net' and 'activation'
// Optimize thread usage to ensure maximum warp efficiency
// Look into shared memory if 'activation' is accessed by multiple threads nearby
// Consider using register for storing frequently accessed data
