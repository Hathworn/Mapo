```
// Optimize global memory access by using shared memory for input and kernel data when possible.
// Perform unrolling of loops to minimize loop overhead and improve performance.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper memory alignment.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only input data to optimize cache usage.
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the number of calculations stored in registers.
// Group threads strategically to maximize use of memory coalescing and reduce divergence.
