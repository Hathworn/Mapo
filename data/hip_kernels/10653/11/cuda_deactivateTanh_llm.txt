```
// Consider coalesced memory access when copying pA to shared_pA to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure shared_pA size does not exceed the block size for optimal shared memory usage.
// If the kernel is memory-bound, try vectorizing to increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Check for occupancy limitations to potentially increase active thread blocks per SM.
