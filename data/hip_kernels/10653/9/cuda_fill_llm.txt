```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory if repeated access to memory locations occurs
// Avoid thread divergence by minimizing conditional statements within critical sections
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously as it may introduce performance overhead if overused
```
