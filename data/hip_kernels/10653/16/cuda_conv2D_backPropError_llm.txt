```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for better cache utilization
// Minimize thread divergence to improve warp efficiency
// Ensure loop interchange is optimized for cache locality
// Adjust block size and grid size for optimal hardware utilization
