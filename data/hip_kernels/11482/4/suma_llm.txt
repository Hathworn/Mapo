```c
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access.
// Calculate thread index outside conditional logic to enhance readability and maintainability.
// Implement warp divergence minimization techniques if applicable for the conditional statements.
// Consider vectorization to increase memory access efficiency if performing repeated operations.
// Review global memory coalescing strategies to ensure sequential memory access by threads.
