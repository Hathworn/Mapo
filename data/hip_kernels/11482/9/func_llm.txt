// Use shared memory for frequent data access to lower global memory traffic
// Consider using vectorized operations for better memory coalescing
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage unless absolutely necessary
// Optimize thread indexing for efficient parallel execution
// Ensure data alignment in shared memory for optimal access speed
// Consider reducing register usage per thread to improve occupancy
