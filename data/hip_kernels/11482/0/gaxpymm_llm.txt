// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring coalesced accesses to shared memory for better performance.
// Use loop unrolling in the dot product computation to reduce control overhead and improve throughput.
// Use memory access coalescing when reading from global memory for array 'a' and 'b'.
// Consider using half-precision floating-point data if precision can be relaxed to improve performance.
// Tune the dimensions of thread blocks and shared memory allocation for optimal occupancy.
