```
// Consider increasing TILE_WIDTH for better occupancy if shared memory allows.
// Ensure that the matrices are aligned in a way that coalesces global memory accesses.
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() calls while ensuring data dependencies are respected.
// Verify that WIDTH is a multiple of TILE_WIDTH to avoid boundary conditions.
// Consider using loop unrolling for the innermost k loop to improve performance.
