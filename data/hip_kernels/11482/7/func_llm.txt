```
// Consider minimizing bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Ensure data is coalesced when loading from or storing to global memory.
// Use __syncthreads to ensure proper synchronization at necessary points.
// Consider using a warp-synchronous technique if possible to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Ensure atomic operations do not become a bottleneck by minimizing their use.
// Evaluate the need for shared memory initialization to avoid unnecessary operations.
