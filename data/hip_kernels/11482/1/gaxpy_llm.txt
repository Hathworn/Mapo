// Consider optimizing the memory access patterns by using coalesced access for the global memory.
// Evaluate if using multiple warps for the reduction could improve performance by parallelizing the sum.
// Consider pre-fetching data into registers where possible to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure that shared memory allocation is optimal and evaluate if using warp shuffle could be effective for reductions.
// Assess if more threads for load balancing might improve kernel execution efficiency.
