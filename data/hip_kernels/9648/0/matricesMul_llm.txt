```
// Optimize data loading to shared memory by coalescing global memory access
// Experiment with different block sizes for better memory access patterns
// Increase occupancy by adjusting shared memory usage if possible
// Ensure memory bank conflicts are minimized in shared memory access
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Check for possible usage of warp shuffles for better performance
