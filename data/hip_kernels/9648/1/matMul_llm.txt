// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Align memory access to improve coalescing
// Use warp-synchronous programming to reduce overhead
// Explore loop unrolling for fixed number of operations
// Balance grid and block dimensions to optimize occupancy
// Profile to identify bottlenecks and adjust memory accesses
