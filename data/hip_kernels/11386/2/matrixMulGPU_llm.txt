// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Load data into shared memory to exploit data locality.
// Synchronize threads after loading shared memory to ensure all data is available.
// Use shared memory to accumulate partial results efficiently.
// Synchronize threads before each new iteration to ensure the previous computations are completed.
