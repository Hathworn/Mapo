```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning block and grid dimensions with memory layout
// Synchronize threads after loading data to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency
// Utilize shared memory effectively to store tiled sections of the image for local computation
// Leverage block and thread indexing to maximize parallelism and occupancy
