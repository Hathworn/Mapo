// Use shared memory to improve data locality.
// Load tiles into shared memory, checking bounds.
// Synchronize to make sure the sub-matrices are loaded.
// Synchronize to make sure that the preceding computation is done before loading new sub-matrices in the next iteration.
// Write the block sub-matrix to global memory, checking bounds.
