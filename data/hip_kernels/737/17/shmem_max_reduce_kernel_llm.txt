```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading from global memory
// Consider occupancy when setting block and grid size
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to minimize overhead
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts during reduction
// Optimize block size to balance between shared memory usage and parallelism
```
