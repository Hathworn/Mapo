```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for d_in to improve performance.
// Optimize the number of threads/block to achieve optimal hardware utilization.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Profile the code to identify bottlenecks in memory access patterns and adjust accordingly.
