// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure boundary checks to avoid illegal memory access.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads during shared memory operations.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning memory access patterns.
// Minimize global memory access within the kernel by loading data into shared memory buffer once.
