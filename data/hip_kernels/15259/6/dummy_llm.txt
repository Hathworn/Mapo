```
// Consider using shared memory for data that is frequently accessed by multiple threads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to minimize global memory transaction overhead.
// Experiment with varying block size to find the optimal balance for occupancy and performance.
// Analyze memory access patterns and reorganize data structures to enhance locality.
// Check for opportunities to reduce atomic operations as they may serialize performance.
