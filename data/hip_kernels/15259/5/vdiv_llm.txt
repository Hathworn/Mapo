```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in a.
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in b.
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in c.
// If applicable, use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring data elements accessed by consecutive threads are in different memory banks.
// Consider the use of vectorized memory loads and stores where possible to maximize memory throughput.
// Profile the kernel to ensure memory access patterns are optimal and do not cause unnecessary serialization.
