```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using consecutive threads to access consecutive elements.
// Use shared memory to store input data if performing further computations.
// Minimize memory transactions by utilizing vectorized types if applicable, such as float4.
// Consider kernel launch configuration to optimize warp utilization, balancing between block and grid size.
