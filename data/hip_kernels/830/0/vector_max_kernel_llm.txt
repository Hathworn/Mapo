```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns.
// Consider using larger block sizes if the GPU architecture allows it.
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce occupancy limitations.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling is beneficial for reduction loop.
// Assess the benefits of using warp-level primitives for reduction.
