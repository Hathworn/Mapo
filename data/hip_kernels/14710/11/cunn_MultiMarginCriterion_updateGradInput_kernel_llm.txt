```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input_k and gradInput_k
// Employ shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by aggregating in shared memory
// Optimize the loop to ensure full utilization of the GPU's resources
// Ensure proper alignment when accessing float arrays to maximize bandwidth
