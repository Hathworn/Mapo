```
// Use shared memory for vector_in to reduce global memory access
// Load vector_in into shared memory to exploit data reusability and decrease latency
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads to avoid race conditions
// Consider adjusting block size and shared memory usage for optimal occupancy
