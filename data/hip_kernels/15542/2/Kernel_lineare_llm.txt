```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread access patterns
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory reads if possible
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop if Nr_val is small and predictable
// Optimize access to ind[], Vp[], Vnp[] by loading into registers when applicable
// Maximize occupancy by adjusting block size to hardware specifics
// Use __restrict__ keyword on pointer arguments if aliasing is not an issue
