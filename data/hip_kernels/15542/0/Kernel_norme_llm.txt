```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for Vd to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to store Vp for better reusability and reduced global memory access
// Optimize loop unrolling for the computation of norma to increase performance
// Consider double buffering technique if applicable to further hide memory latency
