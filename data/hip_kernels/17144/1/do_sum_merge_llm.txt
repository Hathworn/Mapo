```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use warp-level primitives for efficient reduction within warps
// Avoid printf for performance improvements; remove it after debugging
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning data structure
// Optimize thread and block configuration for better occupancy
// Consider using atomic operations if data integrity issues arise
// Minimize divergence by avoiding complex conditional statements
