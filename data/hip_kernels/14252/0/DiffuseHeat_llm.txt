```
// Avoid using non-coalesced memory accesses for currentPoints and nextPoints
// Consider using shared memory for better data locality and reduce global memory access
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() as it can cause performance penalties
// Consider loop unrolling techniques in the while loop for performance improvement
// Ensure the data types used are optimized for the GPU architecture to maximize bandwidth
