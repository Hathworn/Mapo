```
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Ensure that grid and block dimensions maximize device occupancy
// Use shared memory if data reuse is high within each block
// Evaluate the use of vectorized data types to improve throughput
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations for latency hiding
