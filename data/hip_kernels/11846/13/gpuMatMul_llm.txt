```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() after loading data into shared memory
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring appropriate memory access patterns within shared memory
// Consider adjusting BLOCK_SIZE to optimize occupancy and memory usage efficiency
