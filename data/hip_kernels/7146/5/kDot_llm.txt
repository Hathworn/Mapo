```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for improved bandwidth
// Prefetch m2 data into shared memory to minimize latency
// Ensure __syncthreads() are used to avoid race conditions
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize the loop
// Avoid bank conflicts by adjusting shared memory access patterns
```
