```
// Optimize accessing memory by minimizing thread divergence and improving coalesced memory access
// Ensure m1 and m2 are stored in contiguous memory for best performance
// Consider using shared memory if matrices are accessed multiple times within the kernel
// If applicable, adjust grid and block size to match the hardware for maximum occupancy
// Ensure output data is accessed in a coalesced manner
