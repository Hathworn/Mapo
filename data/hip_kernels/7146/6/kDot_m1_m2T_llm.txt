```c
// Consider increasing occupancy by adjusting block size.
// Load m2 elements into shared memory to minimize global memory access.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access by padding shared memory.
// Synchronize threads within the block after loading m2 into shared memory.
// Ensure shared memory size does not exceed hardware limitations.
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to avoid unnecessary synchronization.
// Write output results back to global memory with coalesced access.
