// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve performance
// Use __restrict__ to suggest optimizer that pointers do not alias, improving load/store efficiency
// Minimize divergence in conditional statements to enhance execution efficiency
// Optimize the launch configuration to ensure optimal occupancy and resource utilization
