```c
// Ensure that the kernel launch parameters are optimized for occupancy.
// Consider using shared memory if possible to further improve performance.
// Align data access to improve memory coalescing.
// Optimize thread allocation to reduce memory divergence.
// Consider using vectorized operations if applicable.
