```
// Consider using __shared__ memory for repetitive data access to reduce global memory loads.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures and access patterns.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization barriers within the kernel to reduce overhead.
// Minimize the usage of printf, as it can interfere with parallel execution and performance.
