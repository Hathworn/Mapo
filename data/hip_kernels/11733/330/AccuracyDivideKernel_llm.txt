// Consider using __restrict__ keyword if accuracy is read-only for better memory access optimization
// Utilize shared memory if data needs to be accessed multiple times by threads within the same block
// Ensure coalesced memory access if accuracy is accessed by multiple threads
// Check if compiling with -O3 optimization flag for more aggressive optimizations
