// Consider using shared memory to store 5x5 region data for faster access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use constant memory for invariant data that every thread reads
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads follow similar execution paths
// Optimize loop unrolling for the region summation to reduce loop overhead
