// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access if N is used multiple times.  
// Ensure the alignment of accuracy pointer for optimal coalesced memory access.  
// Minimize global memory writes by storing results only when necessary.  
// Use atomic operations if accuracy might be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
