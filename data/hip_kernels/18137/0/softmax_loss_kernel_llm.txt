// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for faster data accumulation.
// Avoid redundant global memory access by using shared memory to store intermediate results.
// If possible, consider using atomic operations to simplify the reduction process.
// Align memory accesses for predict and target arrays to optimize throughput.
// Consider pre-fetching data into registers to reduce latency caused by memory accesses.
// Use warp-level primitives like warp shuffle to improve reduction performance within the block.
