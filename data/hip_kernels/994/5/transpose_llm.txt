// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to increase computational throughput
// Ensure enough blocks are used to maximize occupancy and utilize full GPU capabilities
