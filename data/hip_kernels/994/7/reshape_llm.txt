```c
// Consider using shared memory to improve coalesced access to src.
// Minimize divisions and modulus operations within the kernel by precomputing where possible.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for both src and dest.
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to fully utilize the GPU's parallel resources.
// Consider using texture memory for better cached access in read-intensive operations.
