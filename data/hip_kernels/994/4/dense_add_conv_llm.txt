```
// Consider using shared memory to cache src values to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize thread block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for dest for more efficient memory access.
// Consider adjusting bias_dim to match natural warp size for better alignment.
