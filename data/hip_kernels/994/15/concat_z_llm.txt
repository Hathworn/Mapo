```
// Use shared memory to avoid redundant global accesses
// Load data into shared memory to minimize global memory transactions
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Optimize memory access by reducing bank conflicts in shared memory
// Write results back from shared memory to global memory efficiently
