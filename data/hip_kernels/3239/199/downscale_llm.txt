```
// Precompute offset indices outside of the inner loops to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread data access
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access
// Optimize thread block size to ensure maximum occupancy and minimize idle threads
// Minimize divergent branching to improve warp execution efficiency
