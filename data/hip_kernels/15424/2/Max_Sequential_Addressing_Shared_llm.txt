// Use coalesced access patterns for loading data into shared memory
// Minimize shared memory usage by calculating the required size dynamically
// Consider using atomic operations for improved memory coherence
// Optimize synchronization by reducing the number of __syncthreads() calls
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance reduction efficiency
