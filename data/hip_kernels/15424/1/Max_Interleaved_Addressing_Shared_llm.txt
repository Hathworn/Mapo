```
// Use float4 data type for coalesced memory access
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reduction
// Minimize shared memory usage by starting the loop from the nearest power-of-two stride
// Ensure optimal block size to maximize occupancy
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for data pointer to improve compiler optimizations
