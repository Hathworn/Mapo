```
// Use shared memory for faster access and less global memory traffic
// Ensure all threads in the block have completed writing to shared memory
// Use a stride loop to efficiently reduce data within a block
// Boundary check to prevent reading out-of-bounds memory
// Use thread 0 to write the final block result back to global memory
