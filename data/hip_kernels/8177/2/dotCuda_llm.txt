// Consider coalesced memory accesses by aligning data and ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory.
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts during intermediate sums.
// Optimize global memory writes by minimizing the number of writes back to global memory at the end of computation.
