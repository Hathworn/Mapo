```
// Optimize: Use shared memory for trystr if multiple threads need the same data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize: Allocate res array on stack instead of heap if the size is known at compile-time to avoid malloc and free overhead.
// Optimize: Avoid frequent malloc and free in id2str; use preallocated buffers to improve performance.
// Optimize: Utilize warp shuffling to compute hashes collectively among threads for better performance in shc function.
// Optimize: Minimize control divergence by restructuring if statements and loops for better warp efficiency.
