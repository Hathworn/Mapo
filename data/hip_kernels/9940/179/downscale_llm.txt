```
// Use shared memory for output accumulation to optimize memory access
// Ensure shared memory buffer size matches block dimensions to prevent overflow
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring proper alignment
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data in shared memory
// Tune block and grid dimensions for optimal memory coalescing
