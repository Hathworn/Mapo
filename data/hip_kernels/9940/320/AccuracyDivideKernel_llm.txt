```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses when accessing the accuracy variable
// Consider using shared memory if the accuracy variable is used by multiple threads
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring uniform execution within the warp
// Minimize global memory accesses by reducing the use of atomic operations
