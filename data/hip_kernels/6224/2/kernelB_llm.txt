```
// Use shared memory to cache x, y, and z data within a block to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to optimize instruction throughput
// Adjust block size according to GPU architecture to maximize occupancy
