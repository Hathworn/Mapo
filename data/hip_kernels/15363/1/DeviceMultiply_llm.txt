```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses in the matrices
// Consider using shared memory to optimize data reuse within the thread block
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize thread and block dimensions for GPU occupancy
// Check for bank conflicts in memory access patterns
```
