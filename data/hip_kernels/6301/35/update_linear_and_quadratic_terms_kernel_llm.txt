```
// Load cur_weight to a register to reduce memory access latency
// Avoid redundant type casting to enhance computational efficiency
// Use thread indices to avoid branch divergence and improve parallel execution
// Prefetch quadratic elements into shared memory if they are reused
// Favor warp divergence over branch divergence for better thread efficiency
// Consider coalesced memory access for updating 'quadratic' to optimize bandwidth
// Use atomic operations minimally to avoid serialization and contention
