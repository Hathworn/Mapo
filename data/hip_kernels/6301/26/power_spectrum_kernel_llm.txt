// Consider using shared memory for `Ar` to reduce global memory access
// Align memory access by ensuring `float2` alignment for `Ar`
// Preload data into registers for improved access speed during computations
// Use `__restrict__` keyword to hint compiler about non-aliasing pointers
// Investigate loop unrolling for the primary computation loop for better throughput
// Ensure coalesced accesses for `Aw` to reduce memory transaction overhead
