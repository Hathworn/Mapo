```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Explore the use of warp-level operations to minimize divergence
// Check for memory bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Minimize the use of atomic operations where possible to improve throughput
