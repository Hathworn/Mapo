```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for optimal memory bandwidth utilization
// Leverage shared memory to store log_energy_floor to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid recomputation by storing computed values in shared memory
// Use a single thread to perform operations that don't require parallelization
```
