```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved memory throughput.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing size, if not all elements are frequently used.
// Use vectorized loads/stores if possible to benefit from wider memory transactions.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to enhance global memory access patterns.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage when not strictly necessary to reduce warp divergence.
