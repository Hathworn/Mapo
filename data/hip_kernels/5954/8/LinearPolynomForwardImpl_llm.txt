```c
// Precompute offsets for probabilities and values to reduce index calculations inside the loop.
// Use __ldg to load constant/global memory efficiently for read-only data (probs and values).
// Iterate over polynomId using gridDim.x to balance workloads across blocks.
// Use atomicAdd to safely accumulate results for each thread across different blocks and dimensions.
