```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by aligning data structures
// Use __ldg intrinsic where applicable to take advantage of cache for read-only data
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads with contiguous memory regions
// Minimize divergence by branching based on warp-synchronous conditions if possible
// Evaluate the usage of shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations inside tight loops
// Consider loop unrolling to lessen loop overhead and increase performance
// Assess the grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and utilization
