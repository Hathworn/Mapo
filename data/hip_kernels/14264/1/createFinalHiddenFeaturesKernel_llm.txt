// Use shared memory to store movie_rating_probs within the block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns by using coalesced memory access for weights.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like movie_rating_probs to leverage cached memory access.
// Evaluate loop unrolling further for the inner loop to improve performance by maximizing instruction throughput.
