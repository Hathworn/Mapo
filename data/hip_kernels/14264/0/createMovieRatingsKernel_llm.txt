```cpp
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as 'initial_hidden_feature_probs'.
// Explore coalesced memory access for 'weights' to improve memory throughput.
// Investigate using texture memory for read-only arrays to take advantage of cached memory access.
// Analyze the possibility of loop unrolling further if the number of hidden features is a compile-time constant.
// Ensure that thread blocks are well-occupying the GPU to maximize resource utilization.
