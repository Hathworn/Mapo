```cpp
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data properly
// Use texture memory for better caching and memory access speed
// Ensure minimal divergent branching for better performance
// Consider using shared memory for temporary data storage to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
```
