```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequent data use.
// Optimize flow_stride and image_stride access patterns to improve coalescing.
// Minimize atomic operations where possible to enhance parallel efficiency.
// Investigate using warp-level optimizations for more efficient reductions.
// Ensure memory alignment for the u, v arrays to prevent access penalties.
// Review the use of __forceinline__ for potential over-utilization impacts.
