```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance
// Minimize number of register variables to maximize occupancy
// Consider shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Use __ldg intrinsic for read-only data to leverage L1 cache
// Explore using float4 for memory reads to reduce latencies
