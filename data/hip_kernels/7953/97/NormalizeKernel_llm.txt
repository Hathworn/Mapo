```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Utilize vectorized operations if applicable, for better performance
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access if shared memory is used
// Optimize thread block size and grid size for maximum occupancy
