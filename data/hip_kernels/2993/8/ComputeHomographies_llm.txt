```cpp
// Optimize memory coalescing by accessing data in a sequential manner where possible
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Evaluate if double-buffering could help in overlapping computation and memory transfer
// Investigate if using tensor cores can accelerate matrix inversion operations
```
