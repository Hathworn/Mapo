```
// Ensure shared memory access patterns are coalesced to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Align data loading into shared memory to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use the constant memory where possible for often accessed data that does not change per thread.
// Optimize the block and thread configuration to fully utilize the GPU's processing capabilities.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization by minimizing __syncthreads calls where possible.
// Hoist invariant calculations out of loops when applicable.
