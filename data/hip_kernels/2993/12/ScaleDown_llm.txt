```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Use aligned memory accesses for `d_Data` to enhance performance.
// Prioritize reusing data loaded into shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Combine loop iterations when possible to decrease the number of synchronization points.
// Evaluate need for all values in shared memory to minimize shared memory usage.
// Unroll loops to potentially reduce loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for the GPU architecture being used.
