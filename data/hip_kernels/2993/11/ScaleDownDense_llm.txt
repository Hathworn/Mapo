```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to load data in tiles, reducing the number of global memory accesses.
// Ensure all threads within a warp are accessing consecutive memory locations where possible.
// Optimize the usage of shared memory by minimizing the allocated size, if possible.
// Minimize synchronization points within the kernel to improve performance.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from caching.
