```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory access for 'adj' as it's accessed with a row-major pattern
// Optimize memory access pattern for 'in' and 'adjIn' to improve cache usage
// Ensure 'mask' memory access is coalesced to maximize memory bandwidth
// Evaluate shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access
// Utilize vectorized loads if applicable for 'b' and 'localMask'
// Consider loop unrolling within the for-loop to reduce loop overhead
