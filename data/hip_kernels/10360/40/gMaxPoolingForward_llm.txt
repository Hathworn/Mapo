// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory reads for 'in' and 'mask'.
// Use constant memory for 'mask' if the size is small and read-only.
// Apply loop unrolling to improve throughput for the loop iterating over width.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for improved memory throughput.
// Use warp-level optimization to reduce divergence when accessing 'in' and 'mask'.
