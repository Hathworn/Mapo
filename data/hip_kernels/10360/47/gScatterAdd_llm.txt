// Consider increasing the shared memory buffer size for larger block sizes
// Optimize the global memory access by increasing coalescing through better memory alignment
// Evaluate if reducing the number of atomic operations improves performance for sparse add
// Investigate potential benefits of loop unrolling if applicable to this kernel
