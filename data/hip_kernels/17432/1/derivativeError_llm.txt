```
// Adjust shared memory size for better optimization based on access patterns
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for global memory reads
// Consider using vectorized types for improving memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling in reduction loop
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls where possible to reduce synchronization overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing its footprint
// Balance grid and block sizes carefully to maximize occupancy
