```
// Consider using shared memory for weights and outputs to reduce global memory access
// Use loop unrolling for small fixed size arrays to minimize branching
// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access consecutive memory locations
// Reduce bank conflicts by padding shared memory arrays as needed
// Analyze workload distribution and maximize occupancy by optimizing block sizes
