```
// Use coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts for better performance.
// Ensure that data_in and data_out are aligned to facilitate coalesced access in global memory.
// Experiment with different BLOCK_SIZE values to find the optimal balance between occupancy and memory usage.
// If the kernel size is small, consider using constant memory to store the kernel for faster access.
