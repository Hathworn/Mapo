```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations for velX, velY, velZ, and d_absv
// Avoid divergent branching by ensuring each thread within a warp executes the same instruction path
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads need to access the same data, though in this case it seems each thread strictly accesses unique data
// Minimize use of local variables to optimize register usage, especially if the kernel becomes more complex
// Ensure kernel launch parameters (block size) are optimized for the GPU architecture to maximize occupancy
