```
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated global memory accesses.
// Align data structures to achieve coalesced memory access patterns.
// Optimize thread block size for better occupancy and performance.
// Consider loop unrolling further by hand if compiler does not optimize adequately.
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier to help the compiler optimize memory accesses.
// Explore using asynchronous memory prefetch to improve bandwidth utilization.
