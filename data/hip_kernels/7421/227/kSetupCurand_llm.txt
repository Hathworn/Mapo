```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better access patterns.
// Minimize divergence by organizing threads to follow the same execution path.
// Investigate using registers for storing repeated computations.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and latency hiding.
