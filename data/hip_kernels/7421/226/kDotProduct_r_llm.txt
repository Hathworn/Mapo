```
// Use shared memory to accumulate partial results, reducing global memory access.
// Ensure efficient use of registers to minimize costly global memory transactions.
// Proper boundary checks prevent illegal memory access and ensure correct calculations.
// Implement loop unrolling for reduction, improving instruction throughput and efficiency.
// Utilize warp intrinsic functions to perform reductions within warps, reducing synchronization overhead.
// Store final block result in global memory only once per block, minimizing memory writes.
