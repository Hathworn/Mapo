```
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth.
// Utilize shared memory if data reuse within the block is possible.
// Align data structures to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Ensure optimal block and grid size configuration for the hardware.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory for intermediate computations.
