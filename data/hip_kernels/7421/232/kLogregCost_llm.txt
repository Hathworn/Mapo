```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant loads from global memory.
// Avoid branch divergence by replacing conditional statements with arithmetic operations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data and addressing patterns.
// Preload data to registers when possible to minimize global memory latency.
// Use warp-synchronous programming to optimize reduction operations for numMax.
