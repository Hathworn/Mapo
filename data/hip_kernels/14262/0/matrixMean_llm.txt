// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Avoid bank conflicts by using padding in shared memory arrays
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring uniform control flow
// Consider loop unrolling for further optimization
// Use more threads per block to optimize reduction process
