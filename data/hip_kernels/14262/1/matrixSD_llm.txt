// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize shared memory size by using only necessary data elements.
// Utilize float4 or vectorized loads/stores if possible for efficient memory access.
// Ensure that shared memory bank conflicts are avoided by proper shared memory alignment.
