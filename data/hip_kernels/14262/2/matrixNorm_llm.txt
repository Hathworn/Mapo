```
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure aligned memory access to prevent costly misaligned access
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring warp branches uniformly
// Optimize block size for best occupancy and performance
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
