```
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by assigning consecutive threads to consecutive data elements.
// Consider increasing thread block size to improve occupancy and throughput.
// Use shared memory if there are repeated access patterns in future optimizations.
// Evaluate performance and memory usage to adjust gridDim.x and blockDim.x for the best efficiency.
