```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives for potential performance enhancement
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for ingrad, outgrad, and indata to help the compiler optimize memory access
// Ensure the block size is selected to maximize occupancy and match the GPU architecture
