```
// Consider using shared memory if there are repetitive accesses to improve memory access times
// Ensure the data is coalesced in global memory accesses for better throughput
// Try to increase the block size to fully utilize available resources
// If N is large, consider using multiple GPUs or streams for better load distribution
