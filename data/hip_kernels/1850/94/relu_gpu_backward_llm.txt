```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous data structures
// Use __restrict__ keyword for ingrad, outgrad, and indata to optimize memory access
// Consider shared memory usage if there are repeated data access patterns
// Adjust block size for optimal occupancy and performance
// Use __syncthreads() if there is shared memory to maintain thread synchronization
