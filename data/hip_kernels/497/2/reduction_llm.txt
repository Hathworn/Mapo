```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for g_data[idx] to improve memory throughput.
// Reduce conditional checks in the loop to improve branch efficiency.
// Use warp shuffle instructions for intra-warp reductions to avoid shared memory usage.
// Ensure shared memory access is bank conflict-free to maximize memory access efficiency.
// Consider using a larger block size if shared memory limits permit to improve occupancy.
