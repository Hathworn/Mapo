// Use shared memory to cache destination offsets and reduce global memory accesses.
// Perform boundary condition checks and load additional data to shared memory.
// Avoid division by zero in_degree check, ensuring loop only executes when necessary.
// Accumulate contributions from source nodes within loop using cached destination offset boundaries.
