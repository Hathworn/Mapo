```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for output1 and output2 to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory effectively by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Reduce global memory access by having each thread load from global memory only once when possible.
// Ensure shared memory is aligned to prevent bank conflicts.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
