```c
// Use shared memory to cache destination_offsets for coalesced access
// Prefetch source_indices into registers to reduce global memory access
// Utilize warp shuffle operations for parallel reduction within a warp
// Improve thread occupancy by choosing a suitable block size
// Ensure __restrict__ pointers are used for all memory pointers to enable better compiler optimizations
// Balance load among threads to minimize thread divergence
```
