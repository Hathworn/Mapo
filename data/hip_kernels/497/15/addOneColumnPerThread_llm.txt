```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache columns and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Avoid divergence in warp by ensuring all threads follow similar execution paths
// Optimize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Check for memory bank conflicts in shared memory access
```
