```
// Optimize data access patterns by maximizing coalesced reads.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Minimize divergent branching within the kernel.
// Ensure memory alignment for optimal access speed.
