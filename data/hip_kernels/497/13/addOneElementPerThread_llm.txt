// Consider using shared memory for data accessed multiple times within the thread
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel for improved warp efficiency
// Ensure n is a suitable number to maximize utilization of available hardware threads
