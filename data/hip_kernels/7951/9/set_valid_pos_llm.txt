```
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block for better latency hiding
// Use cooperative groups if supported to reduce synchronization overhead
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Use memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns
// Avoid divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
