```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Reduce bank conflicts by aligning shared memory access optimally
// Ensure shared memory size is suitable for col_count bounds
// Consider using half precision if col_widths allow for reduced data bandwidth
