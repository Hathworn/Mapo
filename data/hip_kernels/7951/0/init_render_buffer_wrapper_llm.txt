// Consider reducing the number of global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Ensure to synchronize threads after loading and before writing to shared memory
// Consider using coalesced memory access for better performance
// Optimize the use of __syncthreads() to avoid unnecessary synchronization
// Ensure correct usage of shared memory size to avoid bank conflicts
