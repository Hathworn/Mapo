```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Check data alignment for improved access speed
// Minimize divergence by aligning branch conditions across warps
// Use half precision if appropriate to reduce memory bandwidth
```
