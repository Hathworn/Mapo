// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for better performance
// Optimize memory access patterns by loading data into shared memory 
// Ensure proper synchronization when using shared memory to prevent race conditions
// Utilize efficient indexing to minimize redundant calculations
// Handle edge cases separately to avoid unnecessary calculations within the main loop
