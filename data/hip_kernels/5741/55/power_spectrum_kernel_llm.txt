```
// Optimize memory access to improve coalescing by reorganizing data layout in memory
// Consider using texture memory for improved bandwidth in accessing A_in and A_out
// Prefer using fewer registers per thread to increase occupancy
// Use shared memory efficiently to store frequently accessed data and avoid redundant global memory access
// Reduce synchronization points to minimize overhead in parallel execution
// Consider bank conflict handling to ensure optimal shared memory access patterns
