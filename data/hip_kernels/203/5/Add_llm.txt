```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access.
// Evaluate the use of larger block sizes for potential performance gains.
// Experiment with loop unrolling for improved efficiency.
// Ensure alignment of data structures for optimal memory transactions.
