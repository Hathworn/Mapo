```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Consider using shared memory if there are data reuse opportunities within threads of a block.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to maximize memory throughput.
// Use __restrict__ keyword if safe to help the compiler optimize pointer aliasing.
