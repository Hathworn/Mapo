```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within each block.
// Use coalesced memory accesses for zx and zy arrays to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Perform loop unrolling for the divergence computations to reduce instruction overhead.
// Minimize divergence and branch overhead by refactoring boundary checks where possible.
// Pre-fetch data into registers to minimize redundant global memory accesses.
