```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for z1 and z2.
// Unroll loops to enhance instruction throughput.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for f, z1, z2, and g arrays.
// Apply memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to aid the compiler in optimization.
// Align data structures to match memory transaction sizes.
