```
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by using continuous indices
// Minimize memory access by prefetching values into shared memory if possible
// Consider using memory access patterns that reduce bank conflicts
// Utilize warp-level primitives to reduce divergent branching
// If applicable, explore using texture memory for frequent read-only access
