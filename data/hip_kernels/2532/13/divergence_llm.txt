```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access for v array.
// Consider using texture memory for frequent access patterns to avoid global memory bottlenecks.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Thread synchronization can be relaxed for independent computations within warp.
