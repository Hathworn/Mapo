```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimal to prevent bank conflicts
// Prefetch data to registers for improved memory utilization
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to enhance performance
