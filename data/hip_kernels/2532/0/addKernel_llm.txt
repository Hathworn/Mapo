// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns
// Use shared memory if data reuse within the block is beneficial
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and efficiency
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by proper alignment
// Consider leveraging constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data
