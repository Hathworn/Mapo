```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for repeated z values
// Optimize memory access by using memory coalescing for accessing z and f arrays
// Precompute and store repeated computations such as tf * lambda to improve performance
// Use loop unrolling for the divergence computation to minimize branch instructions
