```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for `f` to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to temporarily store data close to `idx` for parallel threads.
// Consider loop unrolling for operations that compute gradients for better performance.
// Analyze memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in accessing `z`.
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data `f` to optimize cache usage.
// Implement asynchronous memory prefetching if applicable to hide latency.
