```
// Consider using shared memory for f[idx] when accessed multiple times to reduce global memory accesses.
// Using vectorized operations for f[idx_px1] and f[idx_py1] could further enhance memory access efficiency.
// Ensure proper alignment of z1 and z2 accesses to improve memory coalescing and reduce latency.
