```
// Consider coalescing memory access for z1, z2, and f to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to load blocks of f into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Examine if loop unrolling would benefit the computation of a and b when calculating the gradient.
// Ensure the index calculations (px, py, idx) are optimal to avoid redundant computations.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like f to take advantage of cached reads.
