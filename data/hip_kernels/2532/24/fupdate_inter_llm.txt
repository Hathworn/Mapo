// Consider coalesced memory accesses for z and g arrays to improve memory efficiency.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Reduce divergence by ensuring warp execution paths converge.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for horizontal and vertical divergence computations.
// Consider using float4 for z array to exploit vectorized computations.
// Optimize conditional checks to minimize branching within the kernel.
// If possible, align data structures for better memory alignment and access patterns.
