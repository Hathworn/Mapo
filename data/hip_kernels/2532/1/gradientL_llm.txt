```
// Use shared memory to cache u values and reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring gradient computation logic
// Consider using a loop to load multiple elements per thread for higher throughput
