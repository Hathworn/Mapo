```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory reads.
// Prefetch data into registers to enhance memory access speed.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to avoid unnecessary memory fetches.
// Ensure proper alignment of input data for coalesced memory access.
// Adjust block size to match the size of the warp for optimal performance.
// Experiment with loop unrolling for the for-loop to increase instruction-level parallelism.
