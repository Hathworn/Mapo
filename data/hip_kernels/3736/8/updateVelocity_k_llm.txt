// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if there's spatial locality in memory access pattern.
// Experiment with different values of block size for optimal performance considering hardware occupation.
// Use loop unrolling for the loop to improve the performance by reducing loop control overhead.
// Align memory accesses properly to reduce memory transaction overhead, especially for coalesced memory access.
// Consider using float4 instead of float2 if proper memory alignment is maintained for better throughput.
