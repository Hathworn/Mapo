// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory access patterns
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used to avoid race conditions between loading and processing phases
// Optimize data reuse by leveraging shared memory for repeated access within the block
// Minimize use of global memory to avoid latency issues, particularly in heavily iterated loops
// Balance load to ensure all threads within a block have an even workload
