// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory for velocity data if it fits to reduce global memory bandwidth pressure
// Combine multiple arithmetic operations where possible to reduce instruction count
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to enhance load/store efficiency
// Optimize the index calculations to reduce redundant computations
