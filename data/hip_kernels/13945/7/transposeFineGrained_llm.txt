```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for input data and output data.
// Ensure shared memory is used efficiently to minimize register usage.
// Optimize the use of shared memory to reduce bank conflicts.
// Ensure synchronization to guarantee correct memory operations.
// Careful management of memory transactions to prevent redundant global memory access.
