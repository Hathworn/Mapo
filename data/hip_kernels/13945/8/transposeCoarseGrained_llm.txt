```c
// Consider increasing TILE_DIM for greater coalescing
// Ensure TILE_DIM+1 to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access
// Optimize BLOCK_ROWS to balance load among threads
// Ensure proper grid size to fully utilize GPU resources
// Minimize memory transfer by maximizing data reuse in shared memory
