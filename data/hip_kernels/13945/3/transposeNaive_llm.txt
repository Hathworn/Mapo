```
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced by reordering data access patterns
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve performance
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations to hide memory latency
// Align data structures to word boundaries to take full advantage of memory bandwidth
// Minimize the use of device-to-host and host-to-device memory transfers
