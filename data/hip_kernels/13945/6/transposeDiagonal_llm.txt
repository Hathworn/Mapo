```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads
// Consider memory padding to prevent bank conflicts in shared memory
// Unrolling loops can enhance performance by reducing loop overhead
// Align shared memory accesses to allow more efficient memory transactions
// Ensure 2D grid dimensions match the transpose kernel requirements
