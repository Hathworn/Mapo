// Ensure coalesced memory access by threads in the same warp
// Utilize shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Maintain coalesced writes back to global memory for efficiency
// Replace static shared memory size with dynamically allocated size if appropriate
// Verify if reducing the number of __syncthreads() improves performance
