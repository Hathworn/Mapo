```cpp
// Ensure block and grid sizes are configured for optimal occupancy
// Consider using shared memory for buf__ if multiple threads access nearby elements
// Use vectorized memory load/store operations if possible
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring idx calculation logic is efficient
```
