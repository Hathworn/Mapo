```
// Consider using shared memory for Mt_M, Mt_S, and invMt_M to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize the kernel launch configuration by choosing an optimal block size and grid size.
// Try to improve memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses within warps.
// Investigate if the loops over dy and dx can be unrolled for better performance.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned and review if float vs double precision affects performance critically.
// Check if the computations can be reduced or reused from previous calculations within the kernel.
