```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for affine_model_id if reused by multiple threads within a block
// Prefetch input data into registers to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced access pattern when reading from and writing to global memory
// Minimize divergent branches by optimizing condition checks
```
