```
// Use shared memory to store guide values and weights to minimize global memory access
// Consider prefetching guide values to reduce latency
// Use __expf intrinsic function for computing exponentials to enhance performance
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput
// Minimize the number of divisions by moving invariants outside of loops
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Optimize thread-block and grid size for maximum GPU utilization
// Align memory allocations to 128 bytes for better memory transfer rates
