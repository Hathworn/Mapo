// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth and reduce latency.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring data is reused effectively, minimizing global memory access.
// Investigate potential bank conflicts within shared memory and opt to adjust access patterns accordingly.
// Evaluate if padding or reshaping the data could help align accesses to hardware characteristics.
// Consider the trade-off of increasing shared memory usage to potentially reduce redundant computations.
