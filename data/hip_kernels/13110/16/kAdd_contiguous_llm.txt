```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by processing contiguous elements
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve throughput
// Consider using shared memory if reuse of data is possible to avoid global memory accesses
// Balance the workload across threads to ensure all threads perform a similar amount of work
// Minimize the use of conditionals inside the loop to reduce branch divergence
