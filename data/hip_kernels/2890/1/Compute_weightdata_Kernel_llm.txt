// Consider coalesced access patterns for global memory reads and writes
// Try reducing divergent branches by minimizing conditions inside the critical loop
// Use shared memory if applicable to store frequently accessed data within a block
// Balance threads per block and blocks per grid to maximize occupancy and use of available resources
