```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency when accessing neighboring pixel values.
// Minimize conditional branching to increase warp efficiency.
// Implement loop unrolling to improve performance of the insertion sort.
// Use integer arithmetic where possible to reduce computational overhead.
// Ensure memory alignment for efficient memory access.
