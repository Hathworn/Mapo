```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use half-precision computations if accuracy requirements permit.
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores with float2 or float4.
// Minimize branch divergence by reorganizing code segments.
// Consider unrolling loops to optimize performance.
