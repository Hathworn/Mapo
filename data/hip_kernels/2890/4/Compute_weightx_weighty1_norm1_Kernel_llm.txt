```
// Load frequently accessed data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider using vectorized loads if data is aligned to maximize memory throughput
// Use __ldg() to cache read-only global memory accesses for better performance
// Evaluate using warp shuffle operations to reduce shared memory usage when possible
// Check for memory coalescing opportunities to optimize global memory accesses
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the best trade-off between parallelism and memory bandwidth usage
