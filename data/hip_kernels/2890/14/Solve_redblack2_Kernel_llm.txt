```
// For memory coalescing, ensure that accesses to output, input, weightx, and weighty are contiguous.
// Use shared memory to cache commonly accessed data between threads, such as weightx and weighty.
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by calculating coefficients using registers.
// Consider loop unrolling for fixed iteration patterns to reduce instruction overhead.
// Minimize read-after-write dependencies to improve instruction throughput.
