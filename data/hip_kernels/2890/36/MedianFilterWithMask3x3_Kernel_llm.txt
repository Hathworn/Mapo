```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses for neighbor pixels
// Use loop unrolling to optimize the inner loops for performance
// Implement memory coalescing by processing multiple pixels per thread for better efficiency
// Avoid branch divergence, especially in conditions based on keep_mask
// Consider vectorizing operations if nChannels is a multiple of 4
