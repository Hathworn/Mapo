// Consider coalescing global memory accesses where possible
// Explore shared memory utilization to reduce memory latency
// Investigate reordering of memory accesses to improve cache locality
// Evaluate potential benefits of loop unrolling if applicable
// Optimize conditional branch prediction with likely/unlikely hints
