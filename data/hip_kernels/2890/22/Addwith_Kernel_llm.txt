```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better performance by aligning memory accesses of neighboring threads
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data within blocks to reduce global memory access latency
// Unroll loops further if the number of channels is small to maximize throughput
// Evaluate using vectorized operations to process multiple channels in parallel and reduce instruction overhead
// Check alignment and padding to ensure memory accesses are efficient and avoid bank conflicts
