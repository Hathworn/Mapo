```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal performance
// Consider using shared memory if Im1 and Im2 are reused across multiple threads
// Minimize register usage by avoiding complex arithmetic operations inside the loop
// Try to maximize the occupancy by tuning block size and number of threads
// Use vectorized memory operations if supported by the hardware
