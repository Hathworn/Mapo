```
// Use shared memory for better memory coalescing for input values
// Load input data into shared memory in a coalesced manner
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads load their respective data into shared memory
// Employ ternary operations for efficient boundary checks
// Optimize memory access by reading and writing data in continuous blocks
// Prefetch data where possible to hide memory latency
