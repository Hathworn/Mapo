```
// Consider using shared memory to store weightx, weighty to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce memory access for input and output arrays to improve memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling for accessing neighboring elements to improve performance
// Minimize the number of operations within conditional statements for efficiency
// Reinforce data locality by organizing data layout to leverage cache hierarchy effectively
