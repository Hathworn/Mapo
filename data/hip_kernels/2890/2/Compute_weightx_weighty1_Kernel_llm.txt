// Use shared memory to cache psi and phi values if they are reused across threads
// Consider using texture memory for absIx and absIy for improved memory access patterns
// Explore the possibility of loop unrolling in case any iterative operations are included
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory transactions for weightx and weighty
