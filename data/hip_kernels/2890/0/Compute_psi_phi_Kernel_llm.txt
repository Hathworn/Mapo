// Consider using __ldg() for read-only gAbsIx and gAbsIy to optimize memory access
// Prefetch data into shared memory if reused multiple times to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by verifying contiguous memory access patterns for gAbsIx and gAbsIy
// Use fast math intrinsics such as __fmul_rn() for multiplication to enhance computational efficiency
// Prevent potential bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring proper alignment
