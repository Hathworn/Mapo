// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for coalescing by using 1D traversal
// Utilize shared memory if multiple accesses to same data occur within the block
// Minimize access to global memory by optimizing thread-block assignments for efficient workload distribution
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations to hide latency during memory transfer
