```
// Utilize shared memory to cache psi since it's accessed multiple times
// Avoid using shared memory for phi as it's accessed sequentially and won't benefit greatly
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for global memory reads/writes
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide latency of global memory access
