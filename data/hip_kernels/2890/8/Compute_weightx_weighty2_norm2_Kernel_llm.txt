// Consider using shared memory for repeated access to common values like norm_for_smooth_term and eps to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that weightx and weighty are accessed consecutively in memory.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to improve compiler optimizations by hinting that the pointers do not alias each other.
// Avoid redundant calculations outside critical if condition to minimize unnecessary operations.
