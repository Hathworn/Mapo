// Optimize memory access pattern by ensuring coalesced reads and writes
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure data alignment to avoid non-coalesced accesses
// Assess the use of register variables to minimize repeated calculations
