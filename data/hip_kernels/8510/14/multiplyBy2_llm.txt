// Consider coalesced memory accesses for improved performance
// Ensure stride access pattern to utilize memory bandwidth effectively
// Align data structures to 128-bit boundaries if possible to reduce misaligned accesses
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory operations
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by proper indexing and padding
