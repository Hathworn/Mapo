// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Explore memory coalescing to optimize data access patterns in global memory
// Implement loop unrolling further if beneficial based on profiling results
// Check for potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage and optimize accordingly
