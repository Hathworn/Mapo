// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning the input and output arrays properly.
// Consider unrolling loops to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing its size to fit within hardware limits.
// Use appropriate memory barriers like __syncthreads() to synchronize threads effectively.
// Ensure proper occupancy by configuring block size and shared memory usage to maximize parallelism.
