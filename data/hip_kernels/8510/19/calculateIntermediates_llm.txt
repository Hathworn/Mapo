```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for xs for better performance
// Optimize shared memory usage if possible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could benefit performance in critical loops
// Use shared memory for intermediates if possible to increase data reuse
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access and address if necessary
// Ensure to optimize the grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
