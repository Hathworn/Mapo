```
// Load 'size' into shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Ensure 'shared_size' is initialized only once per block to improve performance
// Synchronize threads after initializing shared memory to prevent race conditions
// Access 'in' and 'out' arrays using coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
