```
// Utilize shared memory to cache inFreeArray accesses and minimize global memory latency
// Load sharedFreeArray only within a single warp to avoid redundant shared memory usage
// Ensure thread synchronization after loading data into shared memory to avoid race conditions
// Consider using vectorized loads if data alignment permits to further optimize memory access
