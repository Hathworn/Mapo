```
// Optimize thread index calculation by using efficient indexing techniques
// Cache memory access to reduce global memory loads
// Perform operation with cached values to minimize repeated memory access
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize data access within a block
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Minimize the use of double precision in performance-critical sections when possible
