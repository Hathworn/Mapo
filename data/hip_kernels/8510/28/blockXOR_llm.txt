```
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by aligning data structures.
// Consider using shared memory for data that can be reused by threads within a block.
// Use registers to store frequently accessed data for faster access.
// Minimize divergent code paths to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can be applied for improved performance.
// Check if the key can be accessed through constant memory for faster read speeds.
