```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible
// Use dedicated atomic functions for faster atomic operations if needed
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Avoid printf in performance-critical sections and use it conditionally for debugging
