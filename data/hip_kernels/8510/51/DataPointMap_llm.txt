```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for inputX and inFreeArray if possible
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider using vectorized operations to process multiple data elements simultaneously
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives to enhance parallelism and data sharing
// Profile and adjust block and thread dimensions for maximum occupancy and performance
