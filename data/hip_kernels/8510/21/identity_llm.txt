```
// Consider using shared memory for recurrent data access to reduce global memory traffic.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure the input and output arrays are aligned for improved coalesced memory access.
// Utilize appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
// Avoid branching within critical global function parts to improve performance.
