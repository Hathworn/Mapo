```
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Prefetch data from global memory to shared memory to improve cache efficiency
// Ensure coalesced access in global memory reads and writes for better performance
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper alignment
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to decrease overhead in loops
