```
// Ensure only the first block processes data to avoid redundant calculations
// Cache blockDim and threadIdx values in registers to reduce repeated memory accesses
// Unroll loops to reduce index calculation overhead and improve performance
// Use pointer arithmetic to efficiently traverse data and improve memory access patterns
```
