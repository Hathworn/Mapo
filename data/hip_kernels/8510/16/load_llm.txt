```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better performance
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory traffic
// Attempt loop unrolling if `size` and workload warrant it to improve computational throughput
// Align data on 128-bit boundaries if possible to enhance memory access efficiency
// Check for potential warp divergence and minimize it in conditional checks
// Use `__ldg()` for read-only data to leverage texture cache on supported devices
