```
// Load size into a register to minimize repeated global memory access
// Prefetch base[ix] and deviation[ix] into registers to reduce memory latency
// Consider loop unrolling if operations per thread are significant for performance gain
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for base and deviation arrays
// Use shared memory if thread data reuse across iterations is possible
