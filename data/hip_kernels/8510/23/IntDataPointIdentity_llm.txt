```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency and improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used to coordinate threads and ensure memory consistency in shared memory usage
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for both input and output arrays in global memory
// Evaluate whether prefetching strategies can be employed for further memory access optimization
