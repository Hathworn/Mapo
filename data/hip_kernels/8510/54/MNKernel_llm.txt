// Consider using shared memory to cache matrix tiles for faster access.
// Use memory coalescing by aligning data accesses to avoid bank conflicts.
// Employ loop unrolling to improve throughput and reduce loop overhead.
// Check for memory access patterns that can be optimized for better cache utilization.
