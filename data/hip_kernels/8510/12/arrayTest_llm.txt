```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure memory access coalescing for arr and result arrays
// Explore launching the kernel with an optimal block size for improved performance
// Utilize constant memory for const_arr1 and const_arr2 if they are read-only and fit within size limits
