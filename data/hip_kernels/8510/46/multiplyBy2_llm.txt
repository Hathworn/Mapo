```
// Consider optimizing the size of the shared memory to match the blockDim.x
// Use __syncthreads() efficiently to minimize its overhead
// Align shared memory size to the warp size for coalesced access
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization if not all threads are loading data
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize occupancy
// Check memory alignment to improve data access patterns
// Consider using vectorized operations if the problem allows
