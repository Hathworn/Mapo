```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input and output arrays
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if beneficial
// Unroll the loop manually for potential performance benefits
// Align memory accesses to natural boundaries to optimize throughput
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ keyword to help with compiler optimizations
