```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for matrices Md and Nd
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns
// Employ loop unrolling for the innermost loop to increase computational efficiency
// Try reducing the number of synchronizations if data dependencies allow
// Use constant memory if possible for static data to exploit caching advantage
// Consider larger TILE_WIDTH for better performance depending on hardware limits
