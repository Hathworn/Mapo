// Calculate row and col indices outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations
// Use a local accumulator to reduce memory accesses to C
// Perform conditional checks early to avoid unnecessary processing
// Access A and B sequentially within the loop to improve memory coalescing
// Minimize writes by storing the result in a register until the final write to C
