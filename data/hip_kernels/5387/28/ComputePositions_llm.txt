```
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns.
// Use shared memory if possible for frequently accessed data.
// Minimize divergent branches within if-conditions.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable within the logic.
