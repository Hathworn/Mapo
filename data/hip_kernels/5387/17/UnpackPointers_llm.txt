```c
// Review memory coalescing to ensure threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize atomic operations as they can serialize execution
// Evaluate warp synchronization to maximize concurrent execution
// Ensure that memory access patterns leverage cache effectively
```
