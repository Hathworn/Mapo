```
// Consider coalesced access to d_Data to improve global memory throughput.
// Use float2 instead of separate minvals and maxvals arrays for potential optimization.
// Experiment with loop unrolling for binary reduction pattern for further performance gain.
// Evaluate occupancy and shared memory usage for optimal block size adjustments.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used optimally to avoid unnecessary latency.
