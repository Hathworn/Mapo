```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Check alignment of d_Data1 and d_Data2 for potential access speedup
// Ensure result data is written in coalesced manner
// Minimize divergence by ensuring if statement is uniformly reachable
