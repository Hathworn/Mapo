```
// Coalesce accesses to global memory for improved performance
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching to hide latency
// Consider using vectorized data types for memory operations
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Use fewer shared memory arrays if possible to reduce shared memory usage
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by adjusting thread execution paths
