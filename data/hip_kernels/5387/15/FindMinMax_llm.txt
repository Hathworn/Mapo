```
// Use coalesced memory access for d_Data by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Use early return to avoid unnecessary computations for out-of-bound threads
// Unroll reduction loop to further enhance performance
// Implement instruction-level parallelism within warp for better utilization
