```cpp
// Consider using float2 for loading g_Data to reduce memory transactions
// Use __ldg() if data is mostly read-only and fits in the L1 cache
// Ensure alignment of shared memory arrays to prevent bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into shared memory in a coalesced manner
// Reduce shared memory usage by recycling arrays after use
// Apply loop unrolling for histogram reduction for better performance
// Optimize branch divergence by rearranging conditional statements
