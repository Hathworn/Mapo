```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access when fetching 'val' from 'minmax'
// Consider using __ldg() for reading 'val' if 'minmax' is read-only and frequently accessed
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure 'ptrs' updates are coalesced for improved memory throughput
// Reduce warp divergence in the 'if (val)' and inner loop conditions
// Suggest reducing the total number of global memory accesses by accumulating results in registers
// Consider adjusting grid and block dimensions for optimal occupancy and memory bandwidth usage
