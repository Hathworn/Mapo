// Ensure coalesced memory access for loading g_Data to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Reduce the number of `__syncthreads()` calls to prevent unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for the histogram reduction to improve performance.
// Optimize index calculations to prevent redundant computations in critical loops.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring consistent execution paths within threads of a warp.
// Reuse calculated values wherever possible to reduce redundant arithmetic operations.
