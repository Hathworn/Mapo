```c
// Use shared memory to store data and reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Unrolled memory load loop for coalesced memory access to improve performance
// Unrolled computation loop to decrease thread divergence and enhance efficiency
// Ensure shared memory access patterns avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize register usage to maintain occupancy and reduce register spilling
