```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and maximize reuse in inner loops.
// Preload data into shared memory to increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Manage bank conflicts in shared memory by padding arrays if necessary.
// Consider using memory access patterns that reduce memory divergence.
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing temporary variable usage.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized to achieve optimal performance.
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead if loop count is known at compile time.
