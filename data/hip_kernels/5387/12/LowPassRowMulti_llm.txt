```
// Ensure that data is coalesced for optimal memory access.
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data in future architectures.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access.
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory and try to minimize them.
// Optimize thread block size for maximum occupancy.
// Consider using float4 for memory access to increase throughput.
