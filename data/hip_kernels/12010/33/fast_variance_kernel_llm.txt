```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Implement loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Perform memory coalescing to optimize global memory access
// Ensure aligned memory access to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Consider using warp-level primitives for efficient reduction within block
