// Consider using shared memory to cache mean and variance for improved memory access efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access in loading x and storing the result for optimal performance.
// Investigate the potential use of loop unrolling for the spatial loop for faster execution.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to fully utilize the GPU resources available.
