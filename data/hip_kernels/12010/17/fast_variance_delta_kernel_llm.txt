```
// Utilize dynamic shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency.
// Implement loop stride to improve data access patterns and increase coalescing.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads complete local memory updates before reduction.
// Perform reduction within a block for efficient accumulation of results.
