```
// Use shared memory to hold partial results and reduce atomic operations
// Unroll loops to maximize memory coalescing and reduce loop overhead
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results to reduce global memory access
// Parallel reduction within block to minimize thread synchronization
// Reduce the number of synchronization points by optimizing reduction steps
// Avoid branches for better warp efficiency and performance
