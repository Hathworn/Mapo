```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses when reading weights to reduce access time
// Ensure shared memory is adequately sized to avoid bank conflicts
// Minimize atomic operations by reducing their usage or batching them where possible
// Check alignment of data to ensure optimal performance in memory accesses
// Use efficient block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy
