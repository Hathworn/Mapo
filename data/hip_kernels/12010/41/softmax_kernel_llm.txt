```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to utilize global memory bandwidth effectively.
// Minimize shared memory usage by only loading necessary data.
// Optimize shared memory loading and storing by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Reduce the number of synchronizations for better performance.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reductions to improve performance.
