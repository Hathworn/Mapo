// Use coalesced memory access to optimize global memory transactions
// Utilize loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Ensure shared memory allocation is optimal and does not exceed hardware limitations
// Minimize register usage by preferring shared memory for temporary data storage
// Implement warp-level parallelism to further optimize execution efficiency
