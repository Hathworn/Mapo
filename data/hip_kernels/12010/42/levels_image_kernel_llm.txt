```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced access when updating image values.
// Pre-load shared memory with commonly accessed rand values for faster access.
// Consider using half precision if accuracy permits for faster computation and reduced memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergence in warp execution by simplifying conditional statements where possible.
// Group image updates with fused compute to reduce memory access frequency.
