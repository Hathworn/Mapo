// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize warp divergence by aligning loop iterations with warp boundaries
// Consider using atomic operations if multiple threads update the same memory location
