```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize frequent access to data_im_ptr and data_col_ptr
// Reorganize data_im access pattern to ensure coalesced memory access
// Ensure data_col_ptr memory access is well-aligned to improve write efficiency
// Use loop unrolling pragmas efficiently to balance register pressure and instruction throughput
