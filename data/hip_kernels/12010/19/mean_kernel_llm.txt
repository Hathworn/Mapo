```
// Consider using shared memory to store partial sums for improved memory access speed
// Align data accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transaction overhead
// Prefetch data into registers outside of loops to minimize memory latency
// Increase block size if kernel execution is not fully utilizing the compute resources
