```
// Pre-calculate square root of variance outside of the loop if possible
// Consider using shared memory for variance and mean if they are frequently accessed and reused
// Use vectorized loads for reading input data if data alignment allows
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to improve memory access efficiency
