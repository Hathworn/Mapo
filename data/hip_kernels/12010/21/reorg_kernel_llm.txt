// Avoid uncoalesced memory accesses by aligning memory access patterns
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing unnecessary variable usage
// Implement shared memory to store commonly accessed values for threads in a block, if applicable
// Consider loop unrolling for small loops to reduce overhead
// Optimize thread block size and grid dimensions for better occupancy and performance
