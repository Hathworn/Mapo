```
// Prefetch data to shared memory for coalesced memory access
// Use constant memory for frequently used variables like B1 and B2
// Unroll the loop for better performance
// Minimize the use of pow() function by precomputing values outside the kernel
// Consider using half precision for eligible variables to reduce memory bandwidth
// Optimize the use of sqrt() by using fast math functions
// Ensure thread index doesn't exceed the array bounds
