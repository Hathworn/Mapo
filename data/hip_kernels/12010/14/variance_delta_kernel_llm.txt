```
// Consider coalesced memory access for `delta` and `x` by reversing loop order if beneficial
// Utilize shared memory to store `variance[i]` and `mean[i]` if reused multiple times by threads
// Apply loop unrolling for the inner loop over `spatial` to reduce loop overhead
// Assess if prefetching `delta` and `x` for subsequent iterations enhances performance
// Optimize global memory access patterns by aligning data structures if possible
