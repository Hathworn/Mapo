```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads from global memory.
// Investigate benefits of using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory fetches.
// Assess if loop unrolling could enhance performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Explore using atomic operations if necessary for variance accumulation under parallel conditions.
// Examine occupancy to ensure optimal use of GPU resources with current block and grid size configurations.
