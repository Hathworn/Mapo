```c
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses.
// Optimize the block size to better leverage the GPU's compute capability.
// Utilize vectorized memory access if possible to enhance performance.
// Ensure the kernel launch configuration (grid and block size) matches the hardware for optimal occupancy.
