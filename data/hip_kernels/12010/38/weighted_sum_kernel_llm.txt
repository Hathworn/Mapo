```
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed values of a, b, and s.
// Align memory access to improve coalescing and reduce memory divergence.
// Adjust block size for maximum occupancy, aiming for optimal thread count.
// Consider prefetching data for a and b via warp-level primitives.
// Use memory access patterns that favor L1/L2 cache utilization.
// Minimize conditional checks in the main loop, e.g., replace ?: with logic that avoids divergence.
