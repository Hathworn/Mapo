```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for input array to optimize memory throughput
// Ensure that shared memory is used efficiently and avoid bank conflicts
// Verify if using loop unrolling techniques can reduce loop overhead in accumulation
// Evaluate if block size and grid size configuration can be further optimized for better occupancy
