```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Consider loop unrolling for 'for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)' to improve performance
// Minimize divergent branches from 'if (index >= num_pairs) return;' by organizing blocks better
// Coalesce memory access for 'output' and 'delta' arrays to increase memory throughput
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory access latency
