```
// Use a shared memory buffer to enhance memory coalescing
// Align shared memory accesses to ensure efficient utilization
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Ensure data is loaded into shared memory before sync point
// Prefetch data to hide global memory latency
// Consider warp-level primitives for synchronization
```
