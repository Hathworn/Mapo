```
// Consider coalesced memory access for array 'a' to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure memory alignment for 'result' to take advantage of faster memory transactions.
// Utilize shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access latency.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to optimize occupancy and performance.
// Evaluate the use of fast-math functions or intrinsics for performance gains.
