```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using consecutive threads to access consecutive memory addresses
// Minimize divergence by grouping computations that can be vectorized
// Consider shared memory utilization if the kernel will benefit from intermediate storage
// Perform memory reads and writes in a way that maximizes memory bandwidth
// Consider using float precision carefully to avoid unnecessary performance loss
