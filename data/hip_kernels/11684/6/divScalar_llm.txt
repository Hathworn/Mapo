// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'a' and 'result'
// Consider using shared memory to cache 'a' values that are reused across threads
// Reduce thread divergence by avoiding unnecessary conditional statements
// Utilize floating-point operations to leverage hardware acceleration
// Balance workload across threads to improve utilization and throughput
