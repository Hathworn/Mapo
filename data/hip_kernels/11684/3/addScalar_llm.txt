// Consider using shared memory to cache 'b' and reduce global memory reads.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Assess if loop unrolling can improve performance for large dataset processing.
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are optimized based on the GPU architecture.
