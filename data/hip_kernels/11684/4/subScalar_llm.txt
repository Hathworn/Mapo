```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize for GPU memory bandwidth.
// Ensure data alignment for efficient memory access.
// Consider using shared memory if reusing data within threads is possible.
// Minimize memory accesses by storing frequently used variables in registers.
// Adjust block and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy and resource utilization.
// Avoid thread divergence by ensuring uniform branching in conditional statements.
