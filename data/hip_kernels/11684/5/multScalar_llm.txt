```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth usage.
// Evaluate usage of shared memory for repeated data access to minimize global memory reads.
// Check if prefetching data into registers or shared memory can improve performance.
// Review block and grid size configurations for optimal occupancy.
// Consider loop unrolling if there are any loops around the kernel execution.
