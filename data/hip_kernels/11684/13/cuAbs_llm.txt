```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers if no aliasing occurs to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Utilize shared memory for storing temporary results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Experiment with increasing work per thread to improve memory coalescing.
// Ensure that the memory layout allows for coalesced memory access patterns.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could be applied to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Align arrays to 128/256 bytes if possible to enhance memory access efficiency.
