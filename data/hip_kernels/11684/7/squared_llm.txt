// Consider increasing the shared memory size for better utilization if blockDim.x > 256
// Ensure proper memory alignment of shared memory for better access speed
// Evaluate using a stride loop if n is much larger than blockDim.x for better parallelism
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() if possible to reduce synchronization overhead
// Check bank conflicts in shared memory access to improve efficiency
