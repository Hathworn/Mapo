```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize memory access from global memory.
// Optimize access patterns to shared memory to reduce bank conflicts.
// Ensure all threads in a warp reach __syncthreads() for better performance.
// Consider launching kernels with a sufficient number of blocks to keep the GPU occupied.
