```
// Use coalesced memory accesses for loading d_pts1 and d_pts2 into shared memory
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize the memory loading process
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for intermediate scores
// Apply warp-level primitives to optimize reduction within the warp
// Balance the register usage by adjusting the loop unrolling factor
// Minimize __syncthreads to ensure synchronizations are used only when necessary
