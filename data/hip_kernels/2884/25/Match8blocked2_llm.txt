```cpp
// Consider reordering data access to achieve coalesced global memory access for better performance.
// Optimize shared memory usage to minimize bank conflicts during shared memory access.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use warp shuffle operations to reduce syncthreads overhead where possible.
// Tune block size and shape for better occupancy/utilization of GPU resources.
