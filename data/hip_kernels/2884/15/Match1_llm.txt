```
// Consider using shared memory to store d_pts1 and d_pts2 tiles for coalesced access
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory reads
// Minimize the use of registers by reusing variables where possible
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance
// Ensure memory alignment to reduce memory access latencies
