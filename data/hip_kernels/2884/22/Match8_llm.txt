```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Load data in a coalesced manner within loops
// Attempt to unroll loops where possible to enhance instruction-level parallelism (ILP)
// Ensure shared memory access patterns are conflict-free
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to avoid synchronization overhead
// Employ vectorized operations for efficient computation
// Reduce results within shared memory before final write-back to global memory
