```
// Load data into shared memory efficiently for improved memory coalescing.
// Use float4 loading to take advantage of vectorized memory operations.
// Ensure shared memory is completely filled for optimal usage.
// Employ loop unrolling to enhance computational efficiency.
// Perform inter-thread communication to store scores coherently.
// Use warp-level reductions or atomic operations for efficiency.
// Minimize thread divergence for consistent performance.
