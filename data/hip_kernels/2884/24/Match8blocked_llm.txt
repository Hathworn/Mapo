```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses for improved memory access efficiency.
// Use memory coalescing in global memory loads and stores to maximize bandwidth.
// Leverage loop unrolling to enhance instruction-level parallelism and reduce loop overhead.
// Implement efficient synchronization with __syncthreads() to ensure correct data sharing among threads.
// Optimize thread index calculations to improve memory access patterns and reduce computation.
// Apply constant memory for frequently accessed data that does not change to increase cache efficiency.
