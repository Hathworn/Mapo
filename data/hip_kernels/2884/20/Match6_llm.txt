// Coalesce memory accesses to d_pts1 to improve memory bandwidth
// Coalesce memory accesses to d_pts2 to improve memory bandwidth
// Unroll loops to enhance execution efficiency and reduce control overhead
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency
// Perform in-block reduction to minimize warp divergence and synchronization overheads
