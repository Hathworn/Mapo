// Consider increasing shared memory usage to store input data for faster access
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve vectorization
// Ensure that memory access patterns are coalesced for better bandwidth utilization
// Use float4 loads from global memory for efficient access and reducing load instructions
// Leverage shared memory to minimize repeated global memory accesses
// Synchronize threads appropriately to ensure data consistency within shared memory
