```c
// Consider increasing the shared memory size if registers become a bottleneck
// Use coalesced memory access for loading d_pts1 and d_pts2 for optimal performance
// Utilize __syncthreads() to ensure all threads reach synchronization points
// Apply loop unrolling to increase throughput where applicable
// Maximize utilization of the memory bandwidth by aligning memory access patterns 
// Evaluate potential benefits of using float4 for vectorized data processing
// Ensure that shared memory is accessed as efficiently as global memory
