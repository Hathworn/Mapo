```
// Ensure coalesced access to buffer1 to improve memory throughput
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts
// Consider using warp shuffle for reduction instead of atomic operations
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced for buffer2
// Explore loop unrolling for score calculation
// Use appropriate synchronization to avoid race conditions
// Make sure atomic operations do not cause serialization
