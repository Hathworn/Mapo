```
// Consider optimizing data loading by using coalesced memory access patterns.
// Unroll the innermost loops for better performance and optimized parallelism.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure all threads in a block sync before reading shared memory data to prevent race conditions.
// Optimize comparisons by consolidating conditional checks where possible.
// Consider optimizing memory storage patterns for scores and indices.
