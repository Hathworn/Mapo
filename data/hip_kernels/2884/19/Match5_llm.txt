```
// Optimize shared memory bank conflicts by adjusting memory access patterns.
// Consider using loop unrolling for better performance in tight loops.
// Use float4 to load/store multiple data points simultaneously for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage where possible to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for both global and shared memory operations.
// Align data structures to the warp size to maximize the efficiency of memory operations.
