```cpp
// Load input data into shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Use thread synchronization to ensure tiles are completely loaded before computation
// Perform computation using shared memory for faster access compared to global memory
// Synchronize threads again before continuing to the next tile
// Write the computed result back to global memory only after all threads have completed tile computation
```
