```c
// Use shared memory to cache tile of imageIn for coalesced memory access.
// Prefetch input image data to registers to minimize global memory access.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for imageIn and imageOut to improve memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling if loop iterations within the kernel are fixed and known.
// Optimize the calculation by using a register to store width * Row + Col computation.
// Reduce redundant calculation of memory indices for imageOut writes.
