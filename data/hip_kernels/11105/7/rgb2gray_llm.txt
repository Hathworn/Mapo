// Consider using shared memory to load data into the kernel to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns for d_Pin to improve memory throughput
// Explore the use of texture memory for read-only data to enhance cache performance
// Align data structures to 128 or 256-bit boundaries for improved memory access efficiency
// Evaluate the use of half precision arithmetic if precision requirements permit to reduce compute time
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp execution efficiency
