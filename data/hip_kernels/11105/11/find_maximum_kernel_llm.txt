```
// Unroll the data fetch loop to minimize memory access overhead
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Use coalesced memory access pattern for array reads
// Implement warp shuffle for reduction instead of using __syncthreads
// Consider using atomicMax instead of manual mutex lock for simplicity and performance
