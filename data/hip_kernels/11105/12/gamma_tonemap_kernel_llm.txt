```
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed input data within thread blocks
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Minimize redundant calculations, such as reusing computed index values
// Reduce arithmetic operations by precomputing constant values
// Consider using registers for frequently accessed variables such as B, G, R
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
