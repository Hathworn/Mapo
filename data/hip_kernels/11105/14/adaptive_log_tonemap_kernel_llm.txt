```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for imageIn and imageOut to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate values like B, G, R, and reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Prefetch *max, ld_max, and b into local registers to reduce global memory latency.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring threads within the same warp follow similar execution paths.
// Ensure idx calculation is optimized as it is frequently used.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for imageIn and imageOut pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Avoid redundant calculations such as multiple calls to rgb2Lum within the kernel for the same pixel.
// Investigate using float4 or similar vectorized loads/stores for 3-channel data to reduce memory access overheads.
