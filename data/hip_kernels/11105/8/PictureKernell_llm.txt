```
// Consider coalesced memory access by storing d_Pin in shared memory.
// Reduce global memory accesses by caching repeated computations in local variables.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to make optimal use of GPU memory bandwidth.
// Avoid redundant calculations within the kernel by pre-computing index.
