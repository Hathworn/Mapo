```
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Load data into shared memory in a coalesced manner
// Ensure threads in a warp access consecutive memory addresses
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage by reducing unnecessary synchronization
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce idle time waiting for data
// Align tile size with warp size to optimize memory bandwidth usage
