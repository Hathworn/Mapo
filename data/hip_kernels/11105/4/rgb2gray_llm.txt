```
// Consider feasible block sizes to optimize shared memory usage
// Ensure shared memory allocation respects hardware limits
// Use const qualifier for constants like RGB coefficients for optimization
// Minimize redundant memory operations by avoiding unnecessary loads/stores
// Align memory accesses for coalesced memory reads
// Consider loop unrolling if repetitive operations are identified
```
