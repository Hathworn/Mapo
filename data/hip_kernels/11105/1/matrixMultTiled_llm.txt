```
// Use __restrict__ pointers for d_A, d_B, and d_C to help the compiler with aliasing.
// Consider using vectorized types (e.g., float4) for loading tiles to reduce memory transactions.
// Ensure data is aligned to the alignment requirement of vectorized types if used.
// Try using loop unrolling inside the computation loop for potential speedup.
