```
// Consider caching the value of N in a register to reduce memory access overhead
// Ensure that accuracy is stored in shared memory if it will be accessed repeatedly by threads in different kernels
// Utilize warp shuffle functions for any potential data exchange among threads, if applicable
// Minimize the synchronization points to enhance performance
