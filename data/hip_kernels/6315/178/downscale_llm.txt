```cpp
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to enhance coalescing.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure the threads access global memory in a coalesced manner.
// Minimize divergence by optimizing the loop structure.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to improve compiler optimization opportunities.
// Optimize index calculation to avoid redundant computations.
