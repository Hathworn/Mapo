```
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for coalesced access.
// Rearrange shared memory loading to minimize bank conflicts.
// Ensure data reuse through shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align data loads and stores for optimal memory throughput.
// Prefetch data elements to hide memory latency where possible.
