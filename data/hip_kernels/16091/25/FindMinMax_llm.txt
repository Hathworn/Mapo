// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced loads for better performance
// Consider using half warp or warp-level primitives to optimize parallel reduction
// Use atomic operations for reduction to avoid race conditions in shared memory
// Ensure minimal use of __syncthreads() for better efficiency
// Test different block sizes for optimal shared memory utilization
// Use texture or surface memory for read-only data to optimize memory access
