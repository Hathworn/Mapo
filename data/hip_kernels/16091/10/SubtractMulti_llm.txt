```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory patterns.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure that loads and stores are coalesced and aligned.
// Consider loop unrolling if appropriate for further optimization.
// Explore memory access patterns to maximize L2 cache hit rates.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data.
