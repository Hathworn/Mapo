```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses along warp boundaries.
// Consider loop unrolling if further arithmetic operations are needed after subtraction.
// Minimize condition checks by rearranging code structure for better warp execution efficiency.
