```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses where possible
// Consider splitting register-heavy computation across threads for better resource utilization
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses during histogram computation
// Precompute constant values outside of critical loops to minimize redundant operations
// Perform as many arithmetic operations in parallel using multiple threads to increase throughput
