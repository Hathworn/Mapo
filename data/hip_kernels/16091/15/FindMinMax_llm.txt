```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Initialize shared memory to prevent unnecessary global memory reads.
// Unroll loop to improve performance by reducing the loop control overhead.
// Apply warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Ensure a single thread writes the final result to global memory to avoid race conditions.
