```
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing reads from global memory.
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts in accessing `data` array.
// Precompute Gaussian values outside the critical path to reduce redundant computations.
// Align memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization when loading data into shared memory.
// Consider using loop unrolling techniques to further optimize the gradient calculations.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls where possible to decrease synchronization overhead.
// Ensure proper alignment of shared memory size with hardware warp size to maximize efficiency.
// Explore vectorized memory operations for loading data when possible to reduce load instructions.
// Optimize the reduction operation in histogram consolidation to minimize shuttle store interactions.
// Consider using texture or read-only cache for `g_Data` to leverage caching benefits.
