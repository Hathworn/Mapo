```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Improve memory throughput by using coalesced memory access patterns
// Employ loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase performance
// Synchronize threads with __syncthreads() to safely share data in shared memory
// Utilize #pragma unroll to force unrolling of loops for better performance
