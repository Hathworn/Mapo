```
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure proper memory coalescing when accessing global memory
// Minimize memory divergence by aligning data with warp boundaries
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
// Use float3 to handle data in bulk for better memory access patterns
// Synchronize threads efficiently to avoid race conditions and ensure data consistency
