```cpp
// Use shared memory wisely to avoid overuse and bank conflicts
// Minimize the use of global memory access by caching data in shared memory
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses with warp size
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed data if applicable
// Consider reducing memory allocation size by optimizing array dimensions
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in registers
