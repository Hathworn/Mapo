// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory accesses.
// Unroll loops where possible to increase instruction throughput.
// Minimize the number of instructions inside the critical section.
// Ensure the use of warp-level primitives to manage thread divergence effectively.
// Optimize shared memory usage for maximum occupancy.
