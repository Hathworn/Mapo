// Consider coalescing memory accesses for gradOutput_data and gradInput_data
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize divergence by aligning conditional structures within the loop
// Explore opportunities for loop unrolling further where applicable
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
