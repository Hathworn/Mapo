// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for upper[] and cormat[]
// Experiment with different block sizes to find optimal configuration
// Consider loop unrolling for further optimization within if conditions
// Ensure memory alignment for efficient access
