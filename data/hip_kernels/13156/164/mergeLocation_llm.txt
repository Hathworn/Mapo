```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access
// Utilize shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Implement loop unrolling if iterative structures are present
// Consider memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Minimize divergent branches for efficient execution
