```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures and accesses to warp size.
// Minimize divergent branching by aligning thread accesses within warp granularity.
// Use __ldg() for read-only global memory accesses to leverage L2 cache reads.
