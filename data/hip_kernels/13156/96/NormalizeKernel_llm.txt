// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed normalization_factor values.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for the image array to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize conditional operations within the kernel to enhance performance.
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by adjusting block size and grid size for better thread utilization.
