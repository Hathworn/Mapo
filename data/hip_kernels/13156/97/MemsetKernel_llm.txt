```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced access pattern to global memory by organizing index computations efficiently
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory if shared memory is used
// Evaluate warp divergence and try to minimize it for better performance
// Check if reducing the precision of floating-point operations affects the necessary computation accuracy positively
// Consider using asynchronous memory copies to overlap memory operations with computation
