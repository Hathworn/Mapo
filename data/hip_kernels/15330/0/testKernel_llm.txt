```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Analyze memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts
// Utilize loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure proper usage of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions
// Consider warp divergence and optimize control flow
