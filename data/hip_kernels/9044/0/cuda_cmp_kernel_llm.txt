```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring data is coalesced for aptr and bptr
// Evaluate the use of shared memory; might not be necessary for small data sizes
// Use warp-level primitives if applicable for better performance over atomic operations
// Check if reduction operations can take advantage of warp intrinsics
