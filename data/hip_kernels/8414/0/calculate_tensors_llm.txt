```
// Consider using shared memory for fields data to reduce global memory access latency
// Investigate if loop interchange could provide better coalescing of memory accesses
// Evaluate using texture memory for read-only data like fields to improve cache hit rates
// Assess if using warp-level primitives like __shfl_sync could optimize reducing sums
// Explore the possibility of breaking large loops into multiple kernels for better load balancing
