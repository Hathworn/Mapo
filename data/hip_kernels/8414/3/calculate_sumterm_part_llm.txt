```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data that is frequently accessed.
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by reusing data.
// Collaborate between threads using shared memory when accessing identical data.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for all global memory reads and writes.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ keyword to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Seek opportunities to reduce divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Re-access arrays in a coalesced manner for optimal memory bandwidth usage.
