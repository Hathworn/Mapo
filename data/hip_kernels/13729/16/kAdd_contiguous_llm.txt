// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous arrays
// Assign each thread multiple elements to perform computation for better occupancy
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize block and grid size for the hardware to maximize occupancy
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance
