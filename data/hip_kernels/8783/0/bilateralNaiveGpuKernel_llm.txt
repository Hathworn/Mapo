```
// Precompute currentPixel outside the loop to reduce repetitive global memory access
// Minimize bank conflicts by ensuring aligned memory access
// Use shared memory to store input image block to reduce global memory access
// Unroll the loop to minimize loop overhead and use registers efficiently
// Combine small operations to reduce instruction count
// Use texture memory for read-only data to benefit from caching
// Consider using atomic operations for better parallel performance where applicable
