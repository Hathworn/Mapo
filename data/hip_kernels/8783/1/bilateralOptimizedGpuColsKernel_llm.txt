```
// Use shared memory to cache inputImage within each block to reduce global memory access.
// Consider aligning memory access patterns for coalescing to improve memory bandwidth.
// Recompute repeated expressions outside of loops when possible to minimize redundant calculations.
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed constant variables like sigmaD and sigmaR.
