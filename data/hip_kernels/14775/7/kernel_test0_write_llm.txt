```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures to cache line size
// Minimize bank conflicts by accessing memory in stride-1 patterns when possible
// Avoid unnecessary recomputation by storing repeated calculations in registers
// Optimize loop unrolling to maximize instruction throughput
// Use shared memory to further reduce global memory access where appropriate
```
