```c
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced accesses where possible
// Consider prefetching data in advance to hide latency
// Ensure all threads within a warp follow a similar execution path
// Reduce redundant computations within each loop iteration
// Align data pointers to improve global memory access efficiency
```
