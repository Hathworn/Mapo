// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by verifying that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid misaligned memory transactions that can degrade performance.
