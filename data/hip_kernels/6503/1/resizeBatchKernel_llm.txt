```
// Consider using shared memory to improve memory access performance
// Precompute scaling factors outside the kernel to reduce redundant calculations
// Use texture memory for potentially better cache locality when accessing source image
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures and access patterns
// Optimize thread block size considering GPU architecture for maximal occupancy
// Explore the use of asynchronous memory transfers and streams to hide memory latency
