```c
// Consider aligning pV210 and tt memory accesses for better performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where applicable
// Ensure memory access coalescing by verifying the access pattern
// Minimize the number of arithmetic operations inside the loop
// Consider loop unrolling for the RGB conversion loop for better efficiency
