```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to enable coalesced memory accesses
// Use appropriate data alignment to avoid misaligned memory accesses
// Minimize divergence in warp execution by ensuring uniform branching conditions
// Unroll loops where possible to reduce loop overhead
// Balance the workload across threads to avoid idle threads
// Consider using vectorized types or operations for better memory throughput
