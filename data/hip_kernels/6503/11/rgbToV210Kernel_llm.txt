```cpp
// Use coalesced global memory access for pSrc reads by optimizing the way indices are calculated.
// Consider using __ldg() intrinsics for read-only data to potentially improve cache usage.
// Ensure that shared memory access is coalesced to maximize efficiency.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper alignment and usage.
// Unroll the loops for better ILP and potentially lower latency.
// Optimize the way indices are calculated to utilize registers efficiently.
// Minimize the use of division operations in index calculations where possible.
