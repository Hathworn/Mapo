```c
// Consider reducing the number of global memory accesses for better performance.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a contiguous way.
// Explore the use of texture memory to take advantage of caching.
// Ensure the kernel launches with a suitable block size for occupancy and performance.
