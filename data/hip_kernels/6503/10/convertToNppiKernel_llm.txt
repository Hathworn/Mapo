```
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning thread access patterns with memory addresses
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction pipelining and reduced branch overhead
// Minimize redundant calculations and reuse previously computed values where possible
// Balance work distribution across threads to avoid warp divergence
