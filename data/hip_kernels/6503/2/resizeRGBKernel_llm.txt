```
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads by aligning data access
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure that the memory indices are calculated to maximize memory coalescing
// Consider using texture memory for potentially better read efficiency
// Avoid divergent branches to maintain warp execution efficiency
// Prefetch data to reduce latency if beneficial within the kernel
