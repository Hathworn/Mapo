```
// Consider using texture memory for p_Src as it offers better caching performance for repeated access patterns.
// Use shared memory to store p_Src data used by multiple threads within a block to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for p_Src to maximize memory throughput.
// Consider unrolling loops where possible to minimize overhead and take advantage of instruction-level parallelism.
// Leverage faster 32-bit arithmetic by using common techniques like shifting and masking operations.
