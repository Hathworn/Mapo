// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive elements within a warp.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring aligned memory accesses.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts by making stride accesses.
// Consider double buffering or shuffle intrinsic for further reduction optimization.
