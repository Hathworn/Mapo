// Precompute scaled dimensions to reduce repeated calculations
// Reduce multiplicative operations in loops for performance improvement
// Use atomic operations for thread safety in memory write operations
// Consider thread coarsening to reduce atomic operations pressure
// Analyze memory access patterns for possible coalescing opportunities
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow similar execution paths
