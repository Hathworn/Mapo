```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal performance
// Minimize use of global memory by utilizing shared memory if possible
// Avoid thread divergence for better efficiency
// Consider using atomic operations if multiple threads might access accuracy
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if aliasing is not possible
// Limit operations within the kernel for reduced execution time
