```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for input to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize the reduction process
// Minimize shared memory usage by reducing unnecessary allocations and synchronizations
// Ensure atomicAdd is not a bottleneck by optimizing the number of thread blocks
// Check for half-warp divergence in reduction loop and optimize accordingly
