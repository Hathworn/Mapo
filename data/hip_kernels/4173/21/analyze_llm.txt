// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and improve performance
// Consider padding cache to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Ensure the input size is a multiple of blockDim.x to avoid handling out-of-bounds threads
// Use atomic operations cautiously to minimize serialization and contention
