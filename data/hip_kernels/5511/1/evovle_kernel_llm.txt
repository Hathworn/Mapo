```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for neighborhood calculation
// Coalesce global memory accesses when loading oldGen
// Minimize the use of atomic operations by introducing block-level checks
// Implement loop unrolling for neighbor summation if feasible
// Consider using texture memory for frequent read-only access patterns
