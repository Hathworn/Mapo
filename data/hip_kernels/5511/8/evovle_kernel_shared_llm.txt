// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure threads are synchronized before accessing shared memory.
// Utilize atomic operations for efficient data updates across threads.
// Consider optimizing block and grid dimensions for better resource utilization.
// Focus on minimizing idle threads by optimizing thread indexing.
// Consider alignment and memory coalescing for better performance.
