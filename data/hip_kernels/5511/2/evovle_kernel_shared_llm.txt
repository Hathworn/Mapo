```
// Consider using texture memory to exploit cached accesses and reduce global memory latency.
// Try to increase block size if shared memory usage allows it to enhance parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory when loading oldGen into shared memory.
// Evaluate the use of warp-level primitives for synchronization or reduction operations.
