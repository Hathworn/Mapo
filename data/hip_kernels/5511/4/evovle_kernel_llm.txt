```c
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Minimize divergent branches to enhance warp efficiency
// Align memory accesses to cache line size for improved cache utilization
// Optimize atomic operations to reduce contention and improve performance
```
