```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures correctly.
// Optimize memory access patterns to utilize shared memory if beneficial.
// Consider using memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing frequently accessed data in registers or shared memory.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls if they are not essential for synchronization.
