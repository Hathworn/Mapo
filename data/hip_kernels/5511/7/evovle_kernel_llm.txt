```c
// Increase shared memory usage to reduce global memory accesses for neighboring cells
// Minimize use of atomic operations to reduce contention, consider alternate strategies
// Ensure block dimensions fit within the declared shared memory size to prevent overwrites
// Utilize memory coalescing strategies where applicable for the global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for neighbor summation to enhance performance if beneficial
```
