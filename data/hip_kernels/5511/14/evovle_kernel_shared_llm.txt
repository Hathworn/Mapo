```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning global memory access patterns
// Reduce branch divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider using memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Prefetch neighboring cells into registers to reduce shared memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling for operations on neighboring cells to improve performance
// Minimize use of atomic operations, consider alternative synchronization methods if possible
