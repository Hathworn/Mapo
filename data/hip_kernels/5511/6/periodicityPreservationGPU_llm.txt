// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to avoid bank conflicts.
// Explore shared memory utilization for frequently accessed data.
// Maximize the number of threads per block for optimal occupancy.
// Evaluate and adjust block size to better utilize GPU resources.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads follow similar execution paths.
