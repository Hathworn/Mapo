```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads for neighboring cells
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve data locality
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize instruction overhead for neighbor calculations
// Align data structures to cache line boundaries for improved cache performance
// Use memory prefetching techniques to reduce latency from global memory loads
