```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for neighbor calculations.
// Minimize atomic operations by using thread-private counters before final reduction.
// Consider loop unrolling for neighbor accumulation to optimize performance.
// Implement memory coalescing strategies to ensure efficient access patterns.
