// Use coalesced memory access by aligning data load from global memory
// Minimize redundant data loading by leveraging shared memory
// Maximize occupancy by adjusting block size and shape
// Minimize divergent control flow by ensuring boundary checks are consistent
// Optimize atomic operations by reducing contention
