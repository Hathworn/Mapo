```
// Reduce memory access by storing reused calculations like stride
// Ensure coalesced memory access in global memory operations
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed elements if applicable
// Consider vectorizing load and store operations where possible
// Align data access to memory boundaries to enhance throughput
// Optimize for occupancy by balancing block size and register usage
// Investigate memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts
