```cpp
// Use __restrict__ keyword to minimize pointer aliasing and enhance memory access speed
// Implement boundary condition checks to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
// Consider using shared memory or registers for frequently accessed data within blocks if array operations become more complex
// Prefetch data to reduce memory access latency if operations become compute-bound
```
