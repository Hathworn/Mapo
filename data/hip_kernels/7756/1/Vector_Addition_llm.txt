```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations.
// Ensure memory alignments to avoid misaligned access penalties.
// Investigate shared memory usage to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize block and grid sizes to ensure maximum GPU occupancy.
// Utilize constant memory for any read-only data to speed up access.
