```
// Use shared memory for faster data access if applicable
// Ensure data coalescing by having consecutive threads access consecutive data elements
// Minimize global memory access inside the loop to improve performance
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop body is small enough
// Align data structures to memory boundaries for optimized access
