// Use shared memory to optimize access patterns and reduce global memory reads
// Add padding to shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during access
// Ensure memory reads from global memory are coalesced to maximize bandwidth
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory
