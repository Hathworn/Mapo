```
// Consider prefetching matrix elements to shared memory for coalesced access.
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns.
// Ensure threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations for efficiency.
// Investigate grid-stride loops for better occupancy and load balancing.
