// Optimize memory access patterns to improve cache performance by ensuring coalesced memory access.  
// Load matrix dimensions and repeated scalars into shared memory if used frequently to reduce global memory access.  
// Consider splitting the conditional expression to reduce comparison operations if profiling indicates bottleneck.  
// Verify occupancy and adjust block sizes for optimal use of GPU resources.
