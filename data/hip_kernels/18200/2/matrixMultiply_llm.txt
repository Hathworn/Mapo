```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory accesses
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage where possible to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure that the use of shared memory does not exceed available space to avoid potential bank conflicts
