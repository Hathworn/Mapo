// Optimize data access by utilizing shared memory to minimize global memory reads  
// Ensure all threads load data into shared memory before synchronization  
// Use __syncthreads() to guarantee all threads have written to shared memory  
// Replace global memory reads with shared memory accesses for faster computation  
// Make sure that the shared memory size is configured properly for kernel launch
