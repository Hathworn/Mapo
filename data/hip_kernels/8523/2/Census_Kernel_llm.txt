// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for neighboring pixel values.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Apply loop unrolling to optimize the internal loops, as done in the #pragma unroll directive.
// Consider optimizing conditional branches to minimize divergence within warps.
// Explore warp-level parallelism to improve performance when accessing neighboring pixel values.
