```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring RGB_Image is accessed in a contiguous manner for different threads
// Use shared memory if possible to stage RGB data before processing to reduce global memory access latency
// Investigate whether using texture memory could benefit frequent read access patterns such as those in image processing
// Explore loop unrolling or other techniques to minimize arithmetic operations for RGB to grayscale conversion
