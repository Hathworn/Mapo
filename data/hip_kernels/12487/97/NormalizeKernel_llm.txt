// Use shared memory to cache normalization_factor to reduce global memory access
// Use vectorized types such as float4 for coalesced memory accesses and improved throughput
// Consider using loop unrolling for better performance in compute-intensive operations
// Explore memory access pattern for reduction in strided access and enabling coalesced accesses
