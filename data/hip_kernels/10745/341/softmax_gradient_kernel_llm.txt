```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers to enable compiler optimizations for pointer aliasing
// Use float4 vector types for coalesced memory access and reduced global memory transactions
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring data fits within the available limit per block
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() as it incurs overhead and may reduce warp efficiency
// Utilize warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of shared memory for better performance
