// Use a register for accumulation to minimize reads and writes to memory.
// Unroll comparison and blocking accesses to improve instruction throughput.
// Store intermediate sum in shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use loop for reduction with warp-synchronous programming to optimize parallel reduction.
// Use warp-level reduction to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Store result for this block directly in global memory without extra computation.
