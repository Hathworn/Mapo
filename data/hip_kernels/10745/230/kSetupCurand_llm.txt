```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider larger block sizes to improve memory access coalescing
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp execute similar instructions
// Prefer vectorized data access to increase bandwidth utilization
// Profile memory bandwidth to identify bottlenecks and optimize access patterns
