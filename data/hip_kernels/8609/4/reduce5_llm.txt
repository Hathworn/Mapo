```
// Consider increasing the block size to better utilize the GPU's parallel capabilities.
// Use a unified memory policy for optimal global memory access patterns.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses of threads within a warp.
// Minimize conditional statements inside critical loops for better warp execution efficiency.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts at the warp level.
// Replace volatile keyword with __syncthreads() if data consistency is critical across warps.
// Use atomic operations for reduction if further optimization is required for specific use-cases.
// Analyze and optimize instruction-level parallelism using profiling tools.
