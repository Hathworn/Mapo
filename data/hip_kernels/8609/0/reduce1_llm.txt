```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning global memory access patterns
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling further for improved execution efficiency
// Utilize warp shuffle instructions to reduce synchronization overhead
// Assess the use of atomics for potential optimizations in reduction
// Explore use of __ldg for read-only data accesses to enhance cache usage
