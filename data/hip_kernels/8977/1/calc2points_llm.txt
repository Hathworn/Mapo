```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory access patterns
// Prefetch data to shared memory if beneficial to reduce global memory latency
// Consider using vectorized types for improved memory throughput if data alignment allows
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling techniques for operations within the boundary condition
// Align data structures to warp boundaries to optimize memory access efficiency
// Monitor register usage to minimize potential register spilling which can affect performance
