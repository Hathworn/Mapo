```
// Consider coalesced memory access by storing data in shared memory
// Minimize global memory access with shared memory usage
// Use texture memory for potentially higher memory throughput
// Unroll loops if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Evaluate the possibility of occupancy optimization through block size adjustments
