```c
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by selecting appropriate block size
// Minimize divergence by reordering conditional checks
// Use shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for further performance gain
// Align data to 128/256 bytes where possible for better memory throughput
