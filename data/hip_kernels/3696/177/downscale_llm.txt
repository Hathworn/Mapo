// Consider using shared memory to improve memory access speed
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Use __restrict__ pointers to reduce aliasing overhead
// Reduce the number of operations in the loop to enhance performance
// Consider using warp-level operations to minimize iteration overhead
// Ensure data is contiguous in memory to further improve access speed
