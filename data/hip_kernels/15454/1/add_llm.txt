// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations in the loop.
// Evaluate if using float4 data types for x and y can improve memory throughput.
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target hardware architecture.
