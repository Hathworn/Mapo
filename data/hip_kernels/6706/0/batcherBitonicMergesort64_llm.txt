```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access with warp size.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Apply loop unrolling for the innermost substage loop for reduced loop overhead.
// Experiment with different block sizes for potentially improved performance.
// Consider using vectorized data types for further memory access optimization.
