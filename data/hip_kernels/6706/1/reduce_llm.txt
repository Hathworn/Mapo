// Load data in larger chunks to reduce global memory transactions.
// Consider using cooperative groups for warp-level operations.
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Consider using asynchronous copy and prefetching techniques.
// Experiment with block and thread dimensions for optimal occupancy.
