// Use coalesced access patterns to load data from global to shared memory
// Consider using atomic operations for the final reduction to improve performance
// Optimize shared memory access by minimizing bank conflicts
// Employ loop unrolling techniques for better instruction throughput
// Ensure proper synchronization mechanisms are in place to avoid race conditions
