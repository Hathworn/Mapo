// Use shared memory to store data for the current block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for further optimizations in data access.
// Avoid excessive use of branching, use ternary operators where possible for better efficiency.
