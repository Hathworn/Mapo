```
// Cache frequently accessed values from global memory in local variables to reduce global memory access.
// Pre-compute constant expressions outside of loops to avoid unnecessary calculations.
// Use integer division to compute bin_index efficiently by minimizing floating-point operations.
// Write results back to global memory in a coalesced manner to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
