```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal performance
// Minimize divergence by simplifying conditional execution paths
// Leverage shared memory for frequent data reuse where applicable
// Reduce redundant memory loads by using registers for intermediate variables
// Maximize occupancy by optimizing block and grid sizes
