```
// Use shared memory to store normalization constant to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have the updated normalization_constant
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring sequential thread access in global memory
// Consider using vectorized memory operations if possible for improved throughput
