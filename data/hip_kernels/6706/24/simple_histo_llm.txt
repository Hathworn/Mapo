// Ensure coalesced memory access to d_in for improved memory access patterns
// Ensure that d_bins accesses are within L2 cache line to reduce global memory transactions
// Use shared memory to accumulate histogram counts locally before writing to global memory
// Ensure use of warp reductions to optimize the accumulation process in shared memory
