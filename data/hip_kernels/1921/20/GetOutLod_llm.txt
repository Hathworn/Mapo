```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for optimal global memory performance
// Consider using shared memory if num_erased is accessed multiple times to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize block and grid sizes based on the GPU architecture to ensure maximum occupancy
// Check if data reordering can improve memory access patterns
