```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring x and y are contiguous
// Minimize warp divergence by maintaining consistent control flow within a block
// Ensure the usage of shared memory if multiple threads access the same data simultaneously
// Try using memory prefetching if supported, to reduce memory latency
// Align memory allocations to memory boundaries for faster global memory access
