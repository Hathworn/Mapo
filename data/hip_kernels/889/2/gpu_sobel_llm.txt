// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access  
// Implement memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns  
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive operations  
// Explore vectorization to process multiple elements in a single instruction  
// Optimize thread indexing to minimize bank conflicts
