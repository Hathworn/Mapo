```cpp
// Use loop unrolling in gpu_applyFilter to reduce overhead
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts in Gaussian filter
// Preload data into shared memory to optimize memory coalescing
// Reduce redundant memory accesses in gpu_applyFilter
// Use double buffering for overlapping computation and data transfer
