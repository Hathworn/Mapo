```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache input data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by having consecutive thread indices access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using float4 for RGBA based operations to potentially exploit alignment optimizations.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if there is no aliasing to allow the compiler to make more aggressive optimizations.
