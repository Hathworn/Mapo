// Coalesce memory accesses in the global kernel function.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Consider strided access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Fuse loops or operations to reduce kernel launch overhead.
