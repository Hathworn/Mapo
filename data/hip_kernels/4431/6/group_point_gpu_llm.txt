// Consider using coalesced memory access for reading points
// Load indices into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory
// Use shared memory to hold temporary computation results
// Ensure efficient memory access patterns during data copy
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Minimize redundant calculations within inner loops
