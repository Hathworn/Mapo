```
// Use shared memory to cache xyz1 data and reduce global memory access.
// Consider using half-precision floats if accuracy permits to increase cache efficiency.
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns to xyz1 and xyz2 to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Align data structures and memory accesses to avoid misaligned memory access penalties.
// Consider optimizing the distance calculation by removing sqrtf if only comparing squared distances.
