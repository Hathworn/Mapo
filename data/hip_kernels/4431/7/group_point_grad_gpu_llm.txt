```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory reads
// Consider using float2 or float4 types for coalesced memory access and higher throughput
// Optimize the use of atomic operations or explore warp-level primitives to minimize performance impact
// Investigate the use of warp shuffle to reduce unnecessary memory accesses
// Profile and fine-tune grid and block size for better occupancy and memory bandwidth utilization
// Assess the impact of loop unrolling to alleviate loop overhead
