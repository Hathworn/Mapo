```
// Use shared memory for improved performance in data access patterns
// Copy data from global memory to shared memory in coalesced blocks
// Minimize synchronization by reducing shared memory use conflicts
// Ensure efficient load and store operations to shared memory
// Align shared memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Prefetch data to shared memory in advance outside critical loops
