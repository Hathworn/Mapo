```
// Use shared memory to cache xyz2 data and reduce global memory access
// Consider coalescing memory access for more efficient global memory reads
// Use registers to cache xyz1 data inside the loop
// Minimize use of shared memory to only necessary variables to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling inside the second for loop for better performance
