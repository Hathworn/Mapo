```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses for each thread.
// Ensure that idx and val arrays are accessed sequentially to improve memory access efficiency.
// Optimize selection sort with a parallel reduction technique if possible.
// Minimize register usage by reusing variables where feasible.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to reduce the loop overhead.
