```cpp
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure coalesced reads from global memory
// Utilize shared memory to cache 'points' data for faster access
// Avoid redundant calculations by pre-computing and storing frequently accessed values
// Analyze if loop unrolling can improve performance for small 'c' values
// Consider using texture memory if spatial locality exists in 'points' data
// Minimize register usage by structuring loops for efficient variable usage
