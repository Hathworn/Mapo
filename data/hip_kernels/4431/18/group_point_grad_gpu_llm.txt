```
// Consider aligning memory accesses for idx_ptr, grad_out_ptr, and grad_points_ptr to improve cache performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to maximize bandwidth utilization.
// Investigate potential for shared memory usage to reduce global memory reads and writes.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could provide a performance benefit in the inner loops.
// Assess the grid and block dimensions for better workload distribution.
