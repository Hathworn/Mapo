```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Ensure that reads from global memory are aligned to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider using __ldg() intrinsic to take advantage of the read-only data cache.
// Minimize the use of branching to improve warp execution efficiency.
