```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading into shared memory
// Synchronize threads after loading to ensure all data is available
// Iterate efficiently by calculating global index based on block and thread index
// Use modulo operator to handle wrapping around source dimensions
