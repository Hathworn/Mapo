// Use shared memory to store intermediate values for reduced memory access.
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring access to global memory is contiguous.
// Consider unrolling the loop for better performance on architectures with fewer registers.
// Use atomic operations to reduce synchronization overhead and potential bank conflicts.
