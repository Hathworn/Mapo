```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for improved memory throughput
// Prefer shared memory as much as possible to reduce global memory latency
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to decrease synchronization overhead
// Consider reducing shared memory size for larger problem sizes to avoid occupancy issues
// Align data access patterns to take advantage of memory transaction granularity
// Double-check the input data alignment for optimal performance on input loading
