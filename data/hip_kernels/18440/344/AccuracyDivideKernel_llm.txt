```cpp
// Ensure optimal usage of shared memory by avoiding bank conflicts
// Minimize the number of threads that perform global memory writes
// Consider using atomic operations if multiple threads write to the same memory location
// Verify that the `__syncthreads()` call is necessary to avoid performance penalties
// Evaluate if more data can be utilized in shared memory to further reduce global memory access
