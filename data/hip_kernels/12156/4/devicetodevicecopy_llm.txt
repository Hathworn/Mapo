// Consider coalesced memory accesses for dphi, dpsix, and dpsiy arrays
// Use shared memory to temporarily store tile data and reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to ensure full occupancy of GPU resources
// Minimize divergent branches within the if statement
// Prefetch data to shared memory and use it within the if block
