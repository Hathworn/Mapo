```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring continuous threads access continuous memory addresses.
// Reduce divergent branches by restructuring boundary condition checks.
// Use loop unrolling techniques if possible to reduce loop overhead in calculations.
// Prefetch data to registers where applicable to hide memory latency.
