```c
// Use shared memory to cache x and y values to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for xadv and yadv reads.
// Optimize memory access by using warp size aligned tile sizes.
// Consider using atomic operations if updating tracker in concurrent situations.
// Evaluate usage of __restrict__ pointers to minimize pointer aliasing overhead.
