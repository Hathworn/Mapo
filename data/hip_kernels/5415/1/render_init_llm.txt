```
// Utilize shared memory if data reuse is possible between threads
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize the use of global memory by leveraging registers
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
// Align data structures to achieve optimal memory access speed
// Ensure kernel launches use a sufficient number of threads to saturate the GPU
