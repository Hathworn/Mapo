```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve performance.
// Use shared memory wisely to exploit fast on-chip memory for thread collaboration.
// Ensure proper utilization of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations and their impact on performance, potentially reducing them.
// Optimize block size to ensure efficient use of GPU resources and occupancy.
