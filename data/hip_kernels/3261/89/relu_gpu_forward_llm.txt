```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Utilize shared memory for data that is accessed frequently by multiple threads.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to enhance performance further.
// Ensure kernel launch parameters are optimized for hardware capabilities.
