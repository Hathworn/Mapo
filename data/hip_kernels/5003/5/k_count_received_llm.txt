```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced by aligning data structures
// Consider using shared memory if data is reused between threads within the same block
// Utilize __restrict__ pointers to assist the compiler with optimization
// Investigate the possibility of increasing block size for better occupancy
// Profile the kernel to determine if memory bandwidth is a bottleneck
