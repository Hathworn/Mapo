```
// Optimize memory access pattern to ensure coalescing for d_spine_sums.
// Consider using shared memory if d_spine_sums exhibits spatial locality.
// Ensure alignment of d_spine_sums to guarantee efficient memory transactions.
// Minimize use of __ldg unless beneficial due to conflicting memory access patterns.
// Evaluate reducing global memory access by utilizing warp-level primitives when possible.
