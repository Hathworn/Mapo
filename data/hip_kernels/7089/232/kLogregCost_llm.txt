```
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results of parallel reduction
// Minimize thread divergence to improve performance
// Prefetch data to shared memory to enhance memory coalescing
// Use warp shuffle operations for more efficient intra-warp communication
// Consider loop unrolling for improved computational throughput
// Avoid use of atomic operations when possible to reduce contention
