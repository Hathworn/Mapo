```
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimal for the number of threads per block
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding sharedSrc if needed
// Consider coalesced global memory access during initial src loading to shared memory
// Evaluate if loop unrolling would benefit the preload and copy process
// Use constant memory for any read-only data that multiple blocks require
// Employ occupancy calculator tool to tune block and grid sizes for performance
