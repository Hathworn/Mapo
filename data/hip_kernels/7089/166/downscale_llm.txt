```
// Consider using shared memory to cache gradOutput_data segments to reduce global memory access latency.
// Explore memory coalescing by adjusting data layout or access patterns to optimize memory transactions.
// Ensure enough thread blocks and threads per block for full GPU utilization to hide memory latency.
// Assess different grid and block dimensions for maximizing memory throughput and load balancing.
