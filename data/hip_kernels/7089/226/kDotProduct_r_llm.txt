```c
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures and accesses
// Consider increasing shared memory usage to hide global memory latency
// Optimize loop unrolling to enhance parallelism
// Utilize warp shuffle functions for reduction to minimize shared memory use
// Consider occupancy tuning by adjusting DP_BLOCKSIZE and grid configuration
```
