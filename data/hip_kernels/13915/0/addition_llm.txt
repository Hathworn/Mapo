```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths among threads
// Consider using the __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to improve memory access efficiency
