```
// Consider coalesced memory access for the input arrays 'a' and 'b' to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access and improve occupancy.
// Ensure loop unrolling is balanced with register usage to prevent register spilling.
// Optimize the block-level reduction to minimize warp divergence for better performance.
// Evaluate block and grid dimension choices to optimize occupancy and resource utilization.
