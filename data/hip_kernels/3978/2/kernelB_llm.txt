```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache x[i] and y[i] for better memory access patterns.
// Ensure r, x, y, z are allocated with enough memory and the size is valid to avoid out-of-bounds access.
// Use memory coalescing techniques for better global memory access efficiency.
// Check if using constant memory is feasible for any read-only data.
// Balance the block size and grid size for optimal performance depending on the specific GPU architecture.
