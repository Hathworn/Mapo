```
// Consider increasing block size if resources allow for better occupancy
// Prefetch data to reduce global memory latency
// Minimize the use of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory reads
// Double buffer shared memory to hide latency in data transfer
