```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for coalesced access and avoid repeated loads from global memory.
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced, which is already well-aligned for vx and vy arrays.
// Pitch memory is used for writing outputs, which is good for alignment but make sure it is effectively utilized.
// Minimize the divergence within the warp by ensuring the conditional checks do not split warps.
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations inside the loop by hoisting invariant calculations out where possible.
// Consider occupancy or wavefront optimizations if register or shared memory use becomes restrictive.
