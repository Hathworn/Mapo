```
// Consider using coalesced global memory access to improve memory bandwidth.
// Optimize block size and grid size for better occupancy and performance.
// Preload data to registers if possible to reduce latency from shared memory access.
// Ensure that dynamic shared memory size is optimized for the target architecture.
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage to decrease synchronization overhead.
