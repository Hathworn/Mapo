```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as 'v' to reduce global memory access latency.
// Perform loop unrolling in the 'for' loop to increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Optimize address calculation with pre-computed variables to reduce computation time.
// Use __ldg() for read-only data like 'vterm' to take advantage of GPU read-only data cache.
// Investigate coalesced memory access patterns for accessing 'part' and 'v' to enhance memory throughput.
