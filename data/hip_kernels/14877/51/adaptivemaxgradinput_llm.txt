```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for gradOutput_plane by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory.
// Optimize gradInput_plane access by reducing the number of atomic operations if possible.
// Ensure indices_x_plane and indices_y_plane accesses are coalesced for efficient memory reads.
// Evaluate using shared memory to store frequently accessed elements like gradOutput_plane for faster access.
// Test different block sizes for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Minimize divergent threads to ensure warp efficiency.
