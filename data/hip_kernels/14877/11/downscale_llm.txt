```cpp
// Unroll the outer loop to improve parallelism and instruction throughput
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access to gradOutput_data
// Use shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Consider reducing memory traffic by caching repeated calculations
