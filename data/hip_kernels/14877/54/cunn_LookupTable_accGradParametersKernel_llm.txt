```
// Use improved block size calculations to optimize load balancing and reduce thread divergence.
// Exit early when bounds are exceeded, reducing unnecessary computations.
// Avoid processing already processed input values, reducing redundant calculations.
// Precalculate constants to prevent recalculations in the kernel.
// Employ shared memory to cache values, avoiding repeated global memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling to optimize memory accesses and calculations.
// Implement conflict-free memory access patterns to shared memory.
// Ensure early termination of loops for inputs with duplicate values.
