```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for coalesced memory access
// Ensure input and output arrays are aligned to enable efficient memory transactions
// Reorganize data layout in memory to improve cache hit rates
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latencies if applicable
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal memory bandwidth utilization
