```
// Consider increasing the size of shared memory if the block size or data size grows.
// Ensure shared memory accessed is contiguous to enhance memory coalescing.
// Minimize global memory accesses by maximizing shared memory usage.
// Use __syncthreads() carefully to ensure that memory operations are complete for all threads.
// Reduction of shared memory bank conflicts can optimize performance further.
