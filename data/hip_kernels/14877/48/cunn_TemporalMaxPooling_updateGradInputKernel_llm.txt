```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache small chunks of gradOutput_data to reduce global memory reads.
// Exploit memory coalescing by ensuring threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations.
// Consider increasing TILE_SIZE to improve data reuse and reduce effective memory bandwidth.
// Investigate if reducing bank conflicts in the use of shared memory can provide performance gains.
// Experiment with different block sizes and grid configurations to optimize balance between computation and memory access.
