```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Explore the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize register usage to allow more threads per block for higher occupancy.
// Ensure efficient use of L1/L2 cache by maintaining data locality.
// Optimize the use of loop unrolling in the kernel to reduce the number of loop iterations.
