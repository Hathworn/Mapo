// Ensure coalesced memory access for gradOutput pointer
// Ensure coalesced memory access for gradInput pointer
// Optimize memory access for indices_x by ensuring coalesced reads
// Optimize memory access for indices_y by ensuring coalesced reads
// Consider using shared memory for repeated accesses to gradOutput
// Minimize repeated computation of y_start and x_start
// Avoid divergent branches inside the kernel
