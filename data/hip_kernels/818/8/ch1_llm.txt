```
// Use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses
// Avoid redundant memory accesses by reading neighboring pixel values once
// Optimize the thread block size to maximize occupancy and memory throughput
// Utilize vectorized memory operations if supported on the target architecture
