```c
// Consider utilizing shared memory to cache a and b values if multiple accesses are needed
// Ensure coalesced memory access for arrays a, b, and c to maximize memory throughput
// Adjust block size and grid size based on target GPU architecture for optimal performance
// Experiment with different loop unrolling factors to find the best balance between performance and register usage
// Check for register pressure which might increase due to unrolling and adjust accordingly
