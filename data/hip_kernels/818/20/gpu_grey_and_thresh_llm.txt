```
// Ensure memory access coalescing by aligning data and access patterns
// Minimize global memory accesses by storing reused values in registers
// Utilize fast intrinsic operations for arithmetic calculations to improve performance
// Consider using shared memory for storing intermediate values to reduce memory bandwidth demand
