```
// Use shared memory to cache pixel data for faster access and reduced global memory transactions.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper alignment and padding.
// Consider loop unrolling for the blur operation to reduce loop overhead.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed kernel configurations like `k_size`.
