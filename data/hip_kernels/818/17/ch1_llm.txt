// Use shared memory to leverage memory coalescing.  
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce global memory traffic.  
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access to improve performance.  
// Minimize global memory access by using local variables when possible.  
// Ensure aligned memory access for better performance.
