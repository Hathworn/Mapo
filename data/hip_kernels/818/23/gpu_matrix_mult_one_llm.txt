```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses by storing submatrices.
// Ensure enough threads per block to efficiently utilize shared memory.
// Synchronize threads after loading shared memory to ensure data consistency.
// Consider optimizing BLOCK_SIZE for maximum occupancy on the target GPU.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting memory access patterns.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning global memory accesses.
