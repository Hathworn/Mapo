```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for input data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize boundary checking by handling edge cases outside the main computation loop.
// Utilize texture memory for better cache efficiency if applicable.
// Combine adjacent threads' computations to maximize arithmetic intensity.
