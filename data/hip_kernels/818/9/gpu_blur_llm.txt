```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory access within the loop to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize use of division operation, potentially use bit-shift if k_size is a power of 2
// Avoid recalculating values within loops, store in local variables instead
// Consider unrolling loops for small kernel sizes to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure that block size is optimized for the GPU architecture to achieve high occupancy
// Use texture memory for read-only data to potentially improve memory access times
