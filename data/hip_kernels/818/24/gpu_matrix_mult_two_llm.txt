```
// Improve coalesced memory access by adjusting data layout
// Consider increasing tile size for better performance
// Preload more data into shared memory to decrease global memory accesses
// Use warp-wide operations where possible to optimize synchronization
// Optimize loop unrolling factor to balance between registers and cache usage
// Re-evaluate boundary conditions to ensure minimal global memory access latency
