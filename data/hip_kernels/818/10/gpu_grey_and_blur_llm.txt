```
// Utilize coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive data.
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing threads to handle adjacent data elements.
// Consider padding shared memory to handle bank conflicts.
// Increase shared memory size based on optimal blockDim configuration to enhance data reuse.
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads() after each shared memory operation.
// Experiment with varying the blur kernel size and shared memory layout for optimal performance.
