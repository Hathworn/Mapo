```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for row processing
// Check memory alignment for coalesced access
// Increase occupancy by optimizing block size for the given GPU architecture
// Use __restrict__ keyword to hint compiler for independent memory accesses
// Analyze if loop unrolling could improve performance
