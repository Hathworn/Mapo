// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring sequential threads access consecutive memory locations.  
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce redundant global memory accesses.  
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that all threads in a warp follow the same execution path whenever possible.  
// Align memory accesses to optimize global memory transactions speed.  
// Check for read/write conflicts and consider employing atomic operations or avoiding them for better performance.  
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal execution configuration for your specific hardware.
