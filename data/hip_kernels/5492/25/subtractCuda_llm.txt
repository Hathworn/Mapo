```
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Align data structures to ensure optimal loading and storage in memory 
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure all pointers are 8-byte aligned for memory access efficiency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could enhance performance within bounds
