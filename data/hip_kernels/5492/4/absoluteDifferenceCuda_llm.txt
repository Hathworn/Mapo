// Use __restrict__ keyword to indicate that pointers do not alias, optimizing memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring data structures are aligned with warp size
// Minimize bank conflicts by having aligned access patterns for shared memory variables
// Load data into registers before performing arithmetic operations to reduce load latency
// Consider loop unrolling if loops are used within kernel to increase instruction throughput
// Use memory padding if necessary to ensure aligned memory access across different elements
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to match the specific architecture for performance efficiency
