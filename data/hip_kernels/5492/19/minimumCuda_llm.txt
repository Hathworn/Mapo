```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for each thread.
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data access patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling for potential performance benefits.
// Optimize index calculations to avoid redundant arithmetic operations.
// Check the use of const and restrict qualifiers for pointers to aid compiler optimizations.
// Use warp-level primitive operations, if applicable, to speed up computations.
