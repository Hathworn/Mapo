```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant memory accesses and improve cache locality.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory throughput.
// Optimize the use of registers to minimize variable usage and reduce register pressure.
// Evaluate the usage of texture memory for potential performance gains with 2D data.
// Ensure memory alignment for better performance and reduced access costs.
