```cpp
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from and writing to global memory
// Consider using loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Explore occupancy limiting factors and adjust block size for optimal performance
```
