```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Ensure projection array is allocated with sufficient size to avoid overflows
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize atomic operations as they can be a bottleneck; consider reducing their frequency
