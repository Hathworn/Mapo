```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for optimal global memory loading
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access
// Use loop unrolling for improved instruction-level parallelism
// Optimize atomic operations to reduce contention and increase parallel efficiency
// Ensure proper occupancy by configuring block and grid sizes
