```
// Use shared memory to store the lookup table for faster access
// Load the lookup table into shared memory only once per block
// Synchronize threads after loading shared memory to ensure all threads have access
// Ensure memory bounds checking to avoid out-of-bound memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
