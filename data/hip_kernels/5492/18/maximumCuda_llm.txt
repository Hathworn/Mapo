```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in memory
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access if needed
// Optimize block size to balance between parallelism and memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergence by ensuring that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data if access patterns are 2D spatial locality
