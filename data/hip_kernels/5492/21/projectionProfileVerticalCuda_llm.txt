// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Use atomic operations on shared memory instead of global memory.
// Consider coalesced memory access for better performance.
// Avoid redundant synchronization if possible.
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory.
