```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns
// Prefer warp-level operations to optimize thread cooperation
// Minimize divergent branching for better warp efficiency
// Leverage asynchronous memory copy for hiding latency
// Optimize block and grid size for better CUDA occupancy
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data access
