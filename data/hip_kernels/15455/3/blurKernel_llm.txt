```
// Consider decreasing the number of global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Load input data into shared memory before processing to improve memory coalescing
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed read-only data if applicable
// Minimize conditional statements inside the loops to enhance performance
// Balance workload between threads to avoid warp divergence
// Optimize the block and grid dimensions for maximum occupancy
