```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use vectorized loads (e.g., float4) for reading M and N to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize the memory access pattern to ensure that threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using memory padding to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory.
