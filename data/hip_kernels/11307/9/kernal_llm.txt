```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize thread block size to maximize GPU occupancy and minimize idle threads
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring aligned and consecutive memory reads
// Utilize warp-level programming to improve data processing efficiency
// Minimize divergence by aligning conditional statements across warps
```
