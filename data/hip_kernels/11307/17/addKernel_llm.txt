```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory
// Use __syncthreads to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory
// Minimize global memory access by reading data into shared memory first
// Ensure coalesced access by aligning data properly
// Use shared memory to reduce latency and increase throughput
