// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed variables
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths for threads
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for ptr array
// Optimize redundant calculations by using pre-computed constants
// Avoid atomic operations where consistent thread execution can be expected
