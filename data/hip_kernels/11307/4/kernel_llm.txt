```
// Precompute constants outside the loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses if possible
// Ensure thread coalescing by accessing global memory in a contiguous manner
// Optimize memory access patterns to leverage memory coalescing for uchar4
