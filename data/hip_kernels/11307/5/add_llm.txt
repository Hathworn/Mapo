```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory access for arrays a, b, and c.
// Use shared memory if there are repeated access patterns within blocks to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure proper memory alignment for arrays a, b, and c to maximize throughput.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers if no aliasing occurs to aid compiler optimization.
// Investigate occupancy and ensure the number of blocks and threads maximize SM utilization.
