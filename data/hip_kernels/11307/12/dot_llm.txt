```
// Consider using memory coalescing for improved memory access patterns.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Loop unrolling is applied to increase performance by reducing loop overhead.
// Use warp-level primitives to minimize synchronization between threads.
// Ensure alignment of data to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Use volatile keyword for shared memory variables to prevent optimization issues.
// Optimize data transfer by utilizing pinned memory for host-device communications.
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy, if beneficial for workload.
