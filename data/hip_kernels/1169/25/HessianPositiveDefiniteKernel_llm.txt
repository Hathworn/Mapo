```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring global memory accesses are aligned for better performance.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Use warp-level synchronizations to reduce the overhead of __syncthreads().
// Consider tiling techniques to improve memory access patterns for further optimization.
// Evaluate the use of register variables for frequently accessed data within the kernel.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting data layout if necessary.
// Investigate the use of texture memory or constant memory for read-only data to optimize caching.
