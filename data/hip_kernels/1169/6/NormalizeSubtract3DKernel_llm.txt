// Use shared memory to cache img_sub for faster access if there is data reuse.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads.
// Warp divergence can be minimized by ensuring all threads follow the main if-condition.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources and minimize idle threads.
