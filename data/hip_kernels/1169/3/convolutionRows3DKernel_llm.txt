// Ensure data loads are coalesced for optimal memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use tile-based loading to achieve better cache utilization
// Apply loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism
// Consider increasing block dimensions to enhance occupancy
// Ensure synchronization at appropriate points to prevent race conditions
// Validate effective usage of shared memory size for kernel execution
