```
// Ensure effective use of shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Avoid redundant global memory accesses by loading data once into shared memory
// Unroll loops to optimize memory load patterns and increase throughput
// Utilize boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data before proceeding to computations
// Streamline computation by optimizing inner loops and unrolling to maximize parallel execution efficiency
