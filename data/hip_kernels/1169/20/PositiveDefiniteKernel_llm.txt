```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for hessian elements
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Reduce memory transactions by loading data using vectorized float4 loads where possible
// Minimize conditional branching and divergence by organizing threads into coherent warps
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned for better performance
// Consider using atomic operations for writing to hessian_pd to avoid conflicts
