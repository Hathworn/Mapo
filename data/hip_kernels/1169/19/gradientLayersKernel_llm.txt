```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve data locality
// Employ unrolling to decrease the overhead of loop control
// Align shared memory accesses along warp to maximize coalescing
// Load data in coalesced manner by adjusting the pointer arithmetic
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded into shared memory before computation
// Avoid bank conflicts by padding shared memory appropriately if needed
// Ensure boundary checks are minimal to reduce conditional branching
