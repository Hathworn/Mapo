// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Perform unrolled loops to reduce loop overhead & increase instruction throughput
// Ensure proper memory alignment to facilitate coalesced memory access
// Favor minimal branching to reduce divergent threads
// Optimize access patterns to maximize memory coalescing
// Minimize bank conflicts by organizing shared memory access efficiently
