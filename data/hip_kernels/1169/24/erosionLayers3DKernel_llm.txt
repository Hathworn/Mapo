```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth for each thread block
// Use unrolling to improve memory latency hiding and increase instruction level parallelism
// Make use of USHRT_MAX to initialize boundary conditions efficiently
// Consider increasing the size of ER_LAYERS_BLOCKDIM_X/Y/Z while ensuring occupancy remains high
// Synchronize threads to ensure shared memory contents are consistent before computation
