```
// Consider using constant memory for commonly accessed static data
// Optimize block size to achieve better occupancy and warp efficiency
// Ensure IG_BLOCKDIM_X, IG_BLOCKDIM_Y, and IG_BLOCKDIM_Z are tuned for specific hardware
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage by ensuring warp-level synchronization
// Use coalesced memory access patterns where possible
