```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning baseX with block size
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by minimizing padding
// Use #pragma unroll to enhance loop performance, especially for the result computation
// Implement boundary checks to prevent out-of-bound access for d_Src
// Synchronize threads with __syncthreads() post loading to ensure all data is available before computation
