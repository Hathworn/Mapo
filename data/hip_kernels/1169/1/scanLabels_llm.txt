```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed labels data
// Minimize global memory transactions by coalescing memory accesses
// Use register variables for constants like Z1 and Y1
// Reduce warp divergence by ensuring that threads within the same block follow similar execution paths
// Consider loop unrolling if the iteration count is known to reduce loop overhead
// Minimize the number of atomic operations to reduce serialization of threads
