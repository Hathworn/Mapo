```
// Consider using shared memory for d_src, d_erosion, and d_dilation to reduce global memory accesses
// Implement memory coalescing strategies for better memory access patterns
// Explore using texture memory for read-only data like d_src, d_erosion, and d_dilation for cache efficiency
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory access speed
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching if applicable to hide memory latency
