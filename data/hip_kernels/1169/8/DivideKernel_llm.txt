```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Try reducing global memory accesses by utilizing registers
// Ensure coalesced memory access to optimize performance
// Reduce branching within the kernel where possible
// Evaluate if a larger block size could lead to better occupancy
