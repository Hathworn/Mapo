```
// Try to minimize shared memory size by reducing halo steps if possible.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data accesses.
// Explore reducing bank conflicts in shared memory access pattern.
// Ensure full coalesced access for global memory reads and writes.
// Check if loop unrolling factor is optimal for workload and register usage.
// Investigate if using 'volatile' keyword benefits memory read performance.
