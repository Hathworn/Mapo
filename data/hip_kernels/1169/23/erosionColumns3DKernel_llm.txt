```
// Optimize shared memory layout for coalesced global memory access
// Unroll loops to improve instruction-level parallelism
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads synchronize before computation
// Minimize global memory access by loading halos and main data into shared memory 
// Carefully manage halo data to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
