```
// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays h and g
// Use shared memory if frequent access to specific data patterns is needed
// Balance workload by ensuring each block processes sufficient amount of work
// Minimize divergent branches by aligning conditional checks with warp boundaries
// Ensure kernel launch configuration aligns with device's compute capabilities
