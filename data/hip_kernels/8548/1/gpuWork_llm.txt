```
// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays g and h
// Utilize shared memory more effectively for neighboring accesses
// Minimize global memory transactions by optimizing memory access patterns
// Check if loop unrolling benefits the reduction in shared memory
// Investigate benefits of using warp-synchronous programming for reduction
// Ensure memory banks are efficiently accessed in shared memory
// Align memory access patterns to reduce bank conflicts
// Use __ldg() for read-only data to optimize cache usage
// Explore half precision if accuracy allows for faster computation
