```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory loads and stores.
// Utilize shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient reduction operations.
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring proper access patterns to shared memory.
// Assess block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Ensure that the critical path computations are handled within low-latency registers.
