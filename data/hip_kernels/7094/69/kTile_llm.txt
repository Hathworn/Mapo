// Consider coalescing memory accesses for improved bandwidth utilization
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized by loading contiguous blocks
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by verifying access patterns
// Adjust block and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy and performance
// Profile and benchmark to identify further bottlenecks or improvements
