// Consider using more efficient memory access patterns, such as using coalesced access.
// Analyze the possibility of avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting memory layout.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations for global memory updates.
// Consider optimizing the loop by minimizing conditional branches and using loop unrolling.
// Ensure that shared memory usage is efficient and does not exceed available resources.
