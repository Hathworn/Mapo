```
// For memory coalescing, ensure gradOutput_data is accessed in a pattern that maximizes bandwidth
// Consider using shared memory to cache gradOutput_data for repeated accesses within the loop
// Check if loop unrolling can benefit performance by reducing loop overhead
// Determine if atomic operations are necessary when writing to gradInput_data
// Evaluate if having fewer threads with more work per thread would improve register utilization
