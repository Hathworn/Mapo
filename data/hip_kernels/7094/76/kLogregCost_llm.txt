```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for probs, labels, and maxProbs.
// Consider using shared memory to cache probs for each case if numOut is large.
// Avoid accessing global memory inside the for loop by using shared memory.
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling could benefit the for loop iterating over numOut.
