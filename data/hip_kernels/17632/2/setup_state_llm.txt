```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth
// Ensure that 'state' array is allocated in contiguous memory space
// Optimize the use of shared memory if applicable within the kernel
// Evaluate compiler flags for further inlining and unrolling opportunities
// Check for warp divergence and restructure code to avoid it
