// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling can improve performance for `n_loop` iterations
