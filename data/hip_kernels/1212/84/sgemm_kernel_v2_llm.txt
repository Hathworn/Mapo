```
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use shared memory to improve cache efficiency
// Ensure that only valid data is accessed to prevent out-of-bounds reads
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded before computation
// Use loop unrolling for the innermost product calculation to enhance performance
// Synchronize again after computation to avoid data hazards between iterations
// Update global memory only if indices are within proper bounds to prevent errors
