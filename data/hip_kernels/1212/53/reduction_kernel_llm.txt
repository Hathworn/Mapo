```
// Use grid-stride loops to efficiently load data to avoid divergence and improve coalesced memory access.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to improve reduction efficiency within a warp.
// Align shared memory access to avoid bank conflicts during the reduction process.
// Minimize global memory writes by storing intermediate results entirely in shared memory before writing final results.
