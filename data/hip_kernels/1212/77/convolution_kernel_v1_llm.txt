// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access during filter operations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for both reads and writes.
// Preload filter data into shared memory to reduce redundant global memory fetch.
// Minimize conditional branching for better warp execution efficiency.
// Compute memory indices once per loop iteration to avoid redundant calculations.
