```c
// Consider using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure that a and b arrays are aligned to improve memory access efficiency
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns within a warp
// Check for bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Overlap computation with memory operations using asynchronous data transfer where possible
```
