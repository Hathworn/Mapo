```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_input and d_output to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Reduce the number of synchronizations by optimizing the scan algorithm to reduce __syncthreads() calls.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring data access patterns avoid shared memory conflicts.
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives for a more efficient scan implementation.
