```
// Use shared memory to cache A and B tiles to reduce global memory access.
// Employ loop unrolling for the matrix multiplication loop to enhance performance.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for the B matrix to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Implement prefetching strategies to overlap data transfer and computation.
