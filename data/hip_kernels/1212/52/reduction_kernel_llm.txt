```
// Consider using coalesced memory access when reading d_in to improve memory throughput.
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Explore warp shuffle operations to further optimize data reduction.
// Evaluate using atomic operations for final output if applicable.
// Ensure bank conflicts in shared memory are minimized for better performance.
// Consider reorganizing data layout to leverage memory coalescing better.
