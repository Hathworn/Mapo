```
// Use a grid-stride loop to improve memory access patterns
// Store intermediate results in shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Use volatile keyword to avoid redundant memory operations during reduction
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for output write
// Consider using atomic operations for final accumulation in global memory if needed
```
