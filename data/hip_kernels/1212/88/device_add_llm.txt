```
// Ensure efficient memory access patterns by aligning data arrays
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to match the GPU architecture for better utilization
// Use memory coalescing techniques to improve data access efficiency
// Evaluate if larger blocks could enhance performance by minimizing global memory access latency
// Assess if asynchronous memory copy operations could further improve efficiency
