```
// Use shared memory to decrease global memory access latency
// Adjust the size of shared memory arrays based on block dimensions to maximize usage
// Ensure shared memory is used for data that will be accessed multiple times within a block
// Optimize loop unrolling for better performance in accessing shared memory
// Consider alignment and padding of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory
