```
// Consider using memory coalescing for better memory access patterns.
// Ensure shared memory access is conflict-free by aligning data structures.
// Optimize global memory reads by maximizing L2 cache utilization.
// Assess loop unrolling within the accumulation loop to enhance performance.
// Prefetch data if applicable to overlap I/O and computation.
