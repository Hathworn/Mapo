```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access and reduce global memory reads
// Consider increasing the tile size for better shared memory utilization if resources permit
// Optimize loop unrolling in the intra-tile computation to reduce loop overhead
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by padding or using appropriate access patterns
// Reduce the use of __syncthreads() wherever possible while ensuring data consistency
// Use vectorized memory loads if applicable to increase memory throughput
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to hide global memory latency
