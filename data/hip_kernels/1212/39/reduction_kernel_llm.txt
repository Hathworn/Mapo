// Consider minimizing memory access latency by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Use shared memory efficiently to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure memory writes are coalesced for optimal performance.
// Avoid spilling variables to local memory which could increase latency.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to prevent unnecessary synchronization overhead.
