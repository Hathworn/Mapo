```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for A and B
// Optimize memory coalescing for accessing matrices
// Consider using double buffering to hide memory latency
// Adjust block and grid size according to the hardware for optimal performance
// Consider loop unrolling with higher factor if registers allow
