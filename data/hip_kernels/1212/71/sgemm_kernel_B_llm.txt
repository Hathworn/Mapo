```
// Consider using vectorized memory loads for A and B to improve memory coalescing.
// Reorder data loading to maintain read patterns for increased memory throughput.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path.
// Use __builtin_assume_aligned for A, B, and C to inform compiler about alignment.
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring TILE_WIDTH fits within the hardware's shared memory size.
// Use loop unrolling for the inner accumulation loop to enhance instruction-level parallelism.
