```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to buffer random numbers and reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize thread block size to maximize memory throughput and minimize warp divergence.
// Ensure hiprandState_t is initialized properly before usage to avoid redundant calculations within the loop.
// Investigate the use of persistent threads to maintain state and reduce initialization overhead for each loop iteration.
