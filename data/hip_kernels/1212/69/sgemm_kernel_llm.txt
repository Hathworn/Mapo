```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Calculate row and col indices to map threads to matrix elements
// Load data into shared memory in tiles to optimize memory usage
// Use conditional checks to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data loaded before computation
// Multiply tiles in shared memory to lower global memory latency
// Synchronize threads again before loading next tile for correctness
// Combine partial results using alpha and beta for final output
