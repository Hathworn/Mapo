```
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores to optimize memory access patterns
// Utilize warp shuffle operations to reduce shared memory access and improve data sharing
// Optimize loop unrolling inside the kernel to reduce instruction overhead
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by rearranging data layout
// Profile and adjust shared memory size to balance occupancy and memory throughput
