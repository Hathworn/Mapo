// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced to maximize throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory to improve performance
// Minimize divergent branches to optimize execution efficiency
// Use appropriate loop unrolling techniques if applicable to enhance computation throughput
