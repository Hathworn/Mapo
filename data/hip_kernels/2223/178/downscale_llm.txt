// Use shared memory for partial results to minimize global memory access
// Consider cooperative groups for more efficient warp-level operations
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by padding
// Use warp-synchronous programming to avoid barriers and reduce latency
