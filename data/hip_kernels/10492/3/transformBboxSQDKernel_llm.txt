```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access latency
// Use __ldg intrinsic to load read-only data from global memory for improved efficiency
// Consider aligning data to warp size to improve coalesced memory access
// Check for memory access patterns to ensure maximum utilization of memory bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling for array access if applicable to enhance instruction-level parallelism
