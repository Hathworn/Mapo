```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced access by using adjacent threads to access adjacent data
// Minimize divergence by structuring conditional branches uniformly
// Opt for asynchronous memory access to overlap data transfer and computation
// Consider loop unrolling to increase performance
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory access
// Profile kernel to identify and eliminate bottlenecks
