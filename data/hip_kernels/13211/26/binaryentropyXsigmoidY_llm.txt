```
// Consider coalescing global memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory if possible to store values that can be reused by multiple threads
// Ensure that thread indices do not cause bank conflicts within shared memory
// Preload x[i] and y[i] values into registers to reduce global memory access latency
// Unroll loops if beneficial to reduce the loop overhead and improve performance
// Align data structures to cache line boundaries to optimize memory access patterns
