```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by using the stride loop
// Align data to appropriate boundaries for better cache performance
// Optimize grid and block sizes for maximum occupancy and efficiency
// Use shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access latency
// Reduce thread divergence by using consistent branching patterns
