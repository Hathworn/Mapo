```
// Use coalesced memory access for both reading from 'a' and 'b', and writing to 'c'
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimal to maximize memory bandwidth
// Consider increasing the block size and grid size to improve occupancy
// Optimize stride to reduce the number of iterations
// Ensure 'a', 'b', and 'c' are aligned to avoid memory bank conflicts
