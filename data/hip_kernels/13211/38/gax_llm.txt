```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing.
// Use vectorized data types like double2 to load/store multiple data elements in a single transaction.
// Evaluate using fewer threads or adjustable block size for better use of available shared memory and cache resources.
// Ensure that a[0] remains in register for quicker access during repeated computation.
