// Consider using vectorized memory operations to improve bandwidth utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring optimal data access patterns
// Ensure enough shared memory is allocated to avoid out-of-bounds access
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure proper alignment of data in shared memory for better performance
