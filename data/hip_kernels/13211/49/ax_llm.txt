```
// Use coalesced memory access for array b and c to optimize memory transactions.
// Consider using shared memory if b is accessed multiple times by threads within the same block to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to avoid uncoalesced memory transactions.
// Profile the kernel to identify potential warp divergence and eliminate it if possible.
// Consider vectorized operations if data alignment permits and the compiler supports it.
// Evaluate the occupancy of the kernel and adjust block and grid sizes to maximize it.
