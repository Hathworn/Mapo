// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for frequently accessed data
// Optimize kernel launch configuration based on the target architecture's occupancy
// Ensure kernel is memory-bound by analyzing memory bandwidth utilization
