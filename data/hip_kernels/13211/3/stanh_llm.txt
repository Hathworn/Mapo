```
// Use __restrict__ to hint compiler for memory optimization
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data
// Opt for a grid-stride loop to maximize GPU occupancy
// Double-check global memory loads/stores are optimized
