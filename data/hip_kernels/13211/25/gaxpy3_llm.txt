```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better performance.
// Ensure that data alignment is optimal for memory access.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data frequently.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources.
// Minimize the use of global memory and converge to shared memory where possible.
// Avoid memory divergence by ensuring threads within a warp follow similar execution paths.
