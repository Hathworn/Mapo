```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Ensure that input arrays 'a' and 'b' are aligned to improve coalesced memory access
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to benefit from cached access
// Use vectorized data types if elements are aligned to improve memory throughput
// Adjust the block size to maximize occupancy based on the specific hardware capabilities
