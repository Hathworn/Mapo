```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring that thread access to global memory is contiguous.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize use of division in kernel by computing inverse outside and multiplying inside.
// Ensure optimal occupancy by adjusting block size according to the hardware limitations.
