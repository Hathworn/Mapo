```
// Use shared memory if applicable for data reuse patterns
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Reduce the number of divisions by using multiplicative inverses
// Use FMA (fused multiply-add) operations if supported for efficiency
// Minimize branching in the kernel to achieve better warp efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop count is known and small
