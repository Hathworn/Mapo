// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for array 'a'
// Align data structures to ensure optimal access on GPU
// Verify memory access patterns to minimize latency
// Ensure the dimensions of grid and block balance load efficiently
// Investigate shared memory use to reduce global memory reads
