```c
// Consider coalescing memory access to improve throughput
// Ensure data alignment to reduce memory access latency
// Explore using shared memory to cache frequently used data
// Minimize divergence by having uniform control flow for threads
// Optimize block and grid configuration for target GPU architecture
```
