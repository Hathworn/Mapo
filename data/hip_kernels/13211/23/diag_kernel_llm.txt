```
// Use shared memory to cache elements during kernel execution
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Optimize block size for optimal occupancy and performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword to potentially improve load/store efficiency
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory latency
// Minimize branch divergence by restructuring the control flow if necessary
