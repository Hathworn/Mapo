```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'b' to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need access to shared data.
// Minimize divergence by reordering conditions or calculations within the kernel.
// Consider unrolling loops if applicable for performance gains.
// Use appropriate memory access patterns to improve cache efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of __restrict__ keyword to optimize pointer aliasing.
