// Consider using shared memory to reduce multiple loads of the same data
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal performance
// Use __ldg() for reading read-only data if appropriate
// Minimize thread divergence by grouping similar operations
// Validate whether loop unrolling would benefit performance
