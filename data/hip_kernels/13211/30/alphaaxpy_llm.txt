```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for array b and c to improve memory throughput
// Leverage shared memory for array b to reduce global memory access latency further
// Use loop unrolling for lengthC if applicable to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring the workload is evenly distributed among threads
