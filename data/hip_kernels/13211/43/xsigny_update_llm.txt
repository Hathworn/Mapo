```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data in contiguous memory blocks
// Consider using shared memory if 'a', 'b', or 'c' have reusable patterns within a block
// Minimize branch divergence by redesigning the logic if applicable
// Prefetch data into registers where possible to hide memory latency
