```c
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring 'a' and 'b' are aligned
// Utilize shared memory if there is data reuse within a block
// Ensure 'n' is a multiple of the block size for better occupancy
// Use memory padding to avoid bank conflicts if using shared memory
// Consider using loop unrolling for handling larger shifts
// Minimize the number of memory operations in the kernel
