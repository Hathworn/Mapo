```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for the arrays a, b, and c to improve throughput.
// Ensure memory accesses by each warp are sequential to utilize global memory bandwidth effectively.
// Explore shared memory usage if the dataset fits within limits to reduce global memory access costs.
// Use texture memory for arrays a and b if benefits from spatial locality and caching effects are observed.
// Assess the potential benefit of loop unrolling for very large values of lengthA.
// Align memory access with warp boundaries to prevent bank conflicts.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for improved occupancy and resource utilization.
