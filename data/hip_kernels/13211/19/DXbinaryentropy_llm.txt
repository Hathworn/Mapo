```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like 't[0]' to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize the memory access pattern to ensure coalesced access for 'x', 'y', and 'z' arrays.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergence and improve efficiency in calculations.
// Minimize the use of double precision unless necessary to achieve faster computation.
