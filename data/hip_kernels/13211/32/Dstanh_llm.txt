```
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Align data structures to prevent memory misalignment issues
// Use loop unrolling to increase throughput by handling multiple data elements per iteration
// Minimize use of global memory by using local variables wherever possible
// Design grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and balance workload
```
