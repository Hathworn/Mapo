```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures properly
// Consider prefetching data into registers to minimize latency
// Use larger block sizes to increase occupancy and hide memory latency
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp for better performance
