```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads in a block access contiguous memory
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize divergence among threads by ensuring all or none of the threads execute the conditional block
// Align memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth and improve load/store efficiency
