```c
// Consider using shared memory for reusable data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in memory.
// Experiment with different block sizes to maximize occupancy and thus device utilization.
// Utilize __syncthreads() intelligently if shared data is used to ensure correct synchronization.
