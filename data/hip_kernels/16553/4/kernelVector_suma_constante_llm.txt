```c
// Use shared memory if possible to further reduce global memory accesses
// Consider unrolling the loop for better performance
// Ensure array is aligned to prevent uncoalesced memory accesses
// Use __restrict__ keyword to help compiler optimize memory access
// Preload constant into registers if used frequently
```
