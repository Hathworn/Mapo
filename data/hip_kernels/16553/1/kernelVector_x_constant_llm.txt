```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if there is data reuse within a block
// Ensure that the kernel launch configuration (block size) is optimal for the GPU architecture
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring all threads within a warp reach the same branches
