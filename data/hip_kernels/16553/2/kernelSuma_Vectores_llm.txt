```
// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that block size is a multiple of the warp size to optimize execution efficiency.
// Consider utilizing shared memory if multiple threads require access to the same elements to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize for occupancy by tuning the block size and utilizing all available registers.
