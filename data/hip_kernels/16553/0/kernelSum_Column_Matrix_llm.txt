```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access for matrix to improve global memory bandwidth
// Consider using float4 for memory accesses to take advantage of vector loads
// Optimize memory access pattern to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory
// Evaluate performance impact of different block sizes for optimal occupancy
