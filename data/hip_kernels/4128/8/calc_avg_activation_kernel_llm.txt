// Consider using shared memory to store partial sums per block to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access pattern to utilize coalesced memory access for src
// Ensure dst is written in a coalesced manner to improve performance
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes for optimal computation efficiency
