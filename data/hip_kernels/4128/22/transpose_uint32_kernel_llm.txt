```
// Consider using shared memory to improve memory access patterns and reduce global memory latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses by organizing data for contiguous memory access
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring memory alignment
// Use vectorized loads/stores if supported to increase memory throughput
// Optimize the configuration of block and thread dimensions for better performance
// Evaluate the impact of memory access ordering on performance
