```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load the weights in parallel into shared memory
// Ensure proper synchronization with __syncthreads after loading into shared memory
// Consider using warp level primitives for reducing the mean to further optimize shared memory usage
// Minimize __syncthreads usage by optimizing thread block calculations
// Opt for using atomic operations if feasible to reduce synchronization points
// For broadcasting mean, ensure single global memory read for efficiency
