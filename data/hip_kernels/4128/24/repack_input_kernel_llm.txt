// Use shared memory to cache input data to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to increase bandwidth efficiency
// Check if using vectorized data types (e.g., float4) improves performance
// Ensure there is no bank conflict in shared memory usage for better performance
