```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by adjusting array strides
// Try using shared memory for gt_gpu and a_avg_gpu if access patterns allow
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory for optimal performance
// Ensure the use of __syncthreads() is minimal to reduce warp divergence
// Evaluate if looping over channels can be parallelized to increase utilization
