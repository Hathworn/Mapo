```
// Utilize shared memory to cache inputs and weights, reducing global memory access latency.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory throughput.
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to optimize memory access patterns.
// Examine potential use of warp shuffle operations for inter-thread communication.
// Experiment with loop unrolling in channel and filter loops to minimize branching overhead.
// Assess block and grid size configuration to maximize device occupancy and resource utilization.
