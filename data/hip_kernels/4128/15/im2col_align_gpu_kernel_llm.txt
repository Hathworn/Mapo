```
// Use a larger block size to increase parallel efficiency
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data pointers properly
// Minimize branch divergence with conditional statements
// Utilize shared memory if possible for faster memory access
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance
// Reduce global memory access by reusing data within loops
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency
```
