```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access nearby or overlapping data to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory to ensure efficient access patterns
// Minimize divergent branching within kernels to ensure efficient execution across all threads
