```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Group threads in a warp to utilize memory coalescing.
// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data to benefit from L1 cache.
// Align data structures to cache line size to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize divergent warps by ensuring all threads within a block follow the same execution path.
// Ensure shared memory usage fits within the hardware limits to avoid bank conflicts.
// Balance between occupancy and register usage to fully utilize available resources.
// Tune block size and grid size for optimal performance based on the target GPU architecture.
