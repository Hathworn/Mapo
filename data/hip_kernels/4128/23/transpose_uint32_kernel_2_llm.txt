```
// Consider using larger tiles for more efficient memory access pattern
// Make sure the shared memory array is padded to avoid bank conflicts
// Use __restrict__ keyword for src and dst pointers to assist compiler optimizations
// Ensure shared memory load/store accesses are coalesced
// Align the destination memory access pattern to reduce access latency
// Consider prefetching data elements ahead of computation to overlap memory access with computation
