```
// Consider increasing the shared memory allocation size if possible
// Ensure the shared memory usage is within limits to prevent occupancy issues
// Align global memory accesses to improve memory coalescing
// Avoid bank conflicts within shared memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner ksize loops to decrease the overhead
