```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to enhance memory bandwidth utilization
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of warp size to avoid warp divergence
// Optimize the number of memory transactions by combining loads/stores where possible
