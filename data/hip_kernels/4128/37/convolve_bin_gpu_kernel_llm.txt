```
// Consider coalescing the memory access of weights and input to minimize global memory transactions
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory congestion
// Ensure all memory accesses are properly aligned to maximize bandwidth utilization
// Avoid unnecessary shared memory usage by optimizing the shared memory size allocation
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is used correctly to prevent race conditions
// Use atomic operations cautiously to avoid performance bottlenecks in concurrent writes
// Consider loop unrolling if beneficial to reduce loop overhead and improve throughput
// Minimize conditional branching within the core compute loop to enhance execution efficiency
