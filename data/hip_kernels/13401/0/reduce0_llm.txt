// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve data locality.
// Apply strided access pattern to ensure coalesced global memory accesses.
// Utilize __syncthreads() effectively to guarantee memory consistency across threads.
// Implement a tree-based reduction to minimize divergent branches.
