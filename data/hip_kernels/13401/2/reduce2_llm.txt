```
// Consider coalesced memory access on 'in' to improve memory throughput.
// Try using __restrict__ more extensively for better compiler optimization.
// Reduce the stride of accesses to 'in' by modifying loop iteration strategy.
// Try using float4 or float2 for vectorized loads to buffer if applicable.
// Ensure buffer usage remains within shared memory limits for optimal performance.
// Evaluate use of warp shuffle operations for final reduction instead of __syncthreads().
