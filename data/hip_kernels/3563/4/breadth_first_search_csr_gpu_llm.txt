// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes.
// Use warp-level primitives for synchronization and reduction where applicable.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations for updates to global memory.
