```
// Consider using coalesced memory access for matrix_data and in_vector to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to store in_vector values accessed multiple times within the same warp.
// Optimize memory usage by aligning shared memory access to prevent bank conflicts.
// Unroll the loop further with a templated approach for different warp sizes.
// Check if using more warps per block increases occupancy, leading to better performance.
