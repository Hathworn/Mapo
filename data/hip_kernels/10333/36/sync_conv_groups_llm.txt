```
// Ensure coalesced memory access within the kernel for optimal global memory performance.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts for improved shared memory access timings.
// Consider using asynchronous copy functions where appropriate to overlap data transfer and computation.
// Optimize data placement to reduce the number of global memory transactions.
// Utilize warp-level primitives to optimize divergent execution paths.
