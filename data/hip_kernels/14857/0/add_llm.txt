```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a sequential manner
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize kernel launch dimensions to fully utilize device resources
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if possible to improve compiler optimizations
```
