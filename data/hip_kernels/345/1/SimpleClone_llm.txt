// Consider using shared memory to cache `target` and `mask` data for better memory access patterns.
// Ensure memory coalescing in accessing `mask[curt]` and `target[curt * 3 + i]` for improved performance.
// Prefetch data to registers when possible for reduced memory latency.
// Optimize the loop copying target pixels to output by avoiding repeated calculations for indices.
