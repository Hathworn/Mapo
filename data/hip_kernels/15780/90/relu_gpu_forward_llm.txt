```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to cover N efficiently and maximize occupancy
// Minimize memory divergence by grouping conditional logic more effectively
