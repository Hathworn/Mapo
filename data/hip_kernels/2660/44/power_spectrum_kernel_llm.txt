```
// Use shared memory to improve memory access pattern and reduce global memory transactions.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory before proceeding.
// Consider increasing block size or optimizing loop increments for better memory coalescing.
// Handle edge cases separately to avoid branch divergence.
