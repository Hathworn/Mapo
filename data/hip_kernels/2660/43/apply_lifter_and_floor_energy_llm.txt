```
// Consider reducing the use of shared memory if lifter coefficients are small
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Use float variables in shared memory to minimize bank conflicts
// Prefer __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to enable further compiler optimizations
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling to mitigate overhead in the lifter application loop
// Investigate if memory prefetching strategy would help improve performance
