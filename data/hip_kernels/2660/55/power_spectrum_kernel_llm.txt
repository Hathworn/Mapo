// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Utilize continuous memory access patterns to reduce cache misses.
// Minimize divergent branching within the kernel.
// Ensure memory coalescing when writing results back to global memory.
// Reduce bank conflicts by appropriately padding shared memory.
