```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency for cur_tot_weight.
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring coalesced memory patterns in loop iterations.
// Ensure the 'quadratic' array indices are correctly calculated to avoid memory bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if atomic operations can be minimized or replaced for better performance.
// Prioritize warp execution by avoiding branch divergence in kernel.
