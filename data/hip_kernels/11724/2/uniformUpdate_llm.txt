```
// Use coalesced memory access while reading from d_Buffer to improve memory efficiency.
// Use shared memory to store d_Buffer values for reducing global memory accesses.
// Optimize __syncthreads() placement to minimize thread divergence and overhead.
// Prefetch d_Buffer values to shared memory for all threads in advance to improve data locality.
// Consider aligning d_Data access to reduce memory transaction overhead if possible.
// Explore double-buffering or pipelining techniques for overlapping memory operations and calculations.
