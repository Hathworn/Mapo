```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for input data
// Load biases and scales only once per block to exploit data reuse
// Perform common subexpression elimination in the computation to reduce operations
// Replace complex arithmetic expressions with pre-calculated subexpressions
// Use proper barrier synchronization (e.g., __syncthreads) after shared memory operations
// Simplify conditions and minimize branching to enhance thread efficiency
// Avoid redundant computations by combining similar operations
// Enhance data locality by fetching relevant data once and reusing it
