```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Preload bias and scale once per block to reduce repetitive global memory access
// Unroll loops for better performance and reduce control divergence
// Use fmaxf instead of fmax for improved performance on GPUs
// Consider using local memory to cache often-used values instead of shared memory
// Align shared memory accesses to reduce bank conflicts
