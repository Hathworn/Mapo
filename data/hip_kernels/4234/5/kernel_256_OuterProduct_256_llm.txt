```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved global memory efficiency.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data locality.
// Align shared memory access patterns to maximize bandwidth.
// Unroll loops for kernel data loading for better performance.
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used correctly to prevent race conditions.
// Minimize synchronization where not necessary to reduce overhead.
