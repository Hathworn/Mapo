```c
// Copy data to shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Load bias and scale into shared memory to minimize redundant accesses
// Initialize output in shared memory for accumulation
// Perform loop unrolling to enhance loop execution efficiency
// Load block of B matrix into shared memory for better temporal locality
// Utilize unrolling to minimize loop overhead and improve performance
// Reuse data in shared memory across threads to reduce global memory usage
// Apply fused multiply-add for efficient computation in unrolled loop
// Optimize ReLU activation with max function for better performance
