```
// Use shared memory to cache repetitive calculations and avoid redundant global memory access.
// Ensure all threads have completed their operations before syncing shared memory.
// Reduce bank conflicts by aligning shared memory to prevent contention.
// Use a blocking strategy to load data efficiently into shared memory.
// Minimize synchronization within loops to reduce stall and improve performance.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques to enhance throughput in the compute section.
