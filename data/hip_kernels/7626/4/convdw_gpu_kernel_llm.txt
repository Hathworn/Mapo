```
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access patterns and reduce global memory accesses
// Accumulate partial results in registers to reduce memory traffic
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used to synchronize threads and avoid race conditions
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage by ensuring access patterns do not collide
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost loop to reduce loop overhead
