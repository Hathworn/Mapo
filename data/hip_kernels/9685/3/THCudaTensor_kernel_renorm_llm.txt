// Consider optimizing memory access by using coalesced memory patterns.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize accesses to global memory.
// Implement loop unrolling to reduce the loop overhead in stride loop.
// Use atomic operations cautiously, they might affect performance due to serialization.
