```
// Consider using shared memory to store input data for reuse within the kernel
// Apply loop unrolling in the innermost loops for increased performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access for input and output arrays for better bandwidth utilization
// Prefetch data into registers where possible to reduce memory access latency
// Utilize memory access patterns that minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Optimize the launch configuration to maximize occupancy based on resource availability
// Explore opportunities for using constant memory for kernel weights if they remain unchanged across threads
