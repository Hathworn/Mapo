```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data if possible
// Eliminate divergent branches where feasible
// Reduce memory access by reusing loaded data within thread block
// Optimize loop unrolling to improve performance
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency
// Use vectorized loads/stores to improve memory throughput
// Evaluate use of compiler flags for further optimization
