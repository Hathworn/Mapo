```
// Consider using shared memory to buffer input data for each block and reduce global memory accesses.
// Utilize vectorized loads and stores for coalesced memory access patterns in A, B, AP, and BP arrays.
// Minimize register usage by unrolling inner loops for smaller patch sizes.
// Evaluate memory alignment and ensure data is aligned for optimal access patterns.
// Consider the use of texture memory if data access patterns are suitable.
