```
// Consider using shared memory to cache conv data to reduce global memory access.
// Use const memory for s_size or s_rad if they remain unchanged to reduce register pressure.
// Consider thread coarsening to improve occupancy and reduce control divergence.
// Leverage memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns to improve read/write throughput.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations and ensure there are no bank conflicts.
// Try to maximize the use of registers by reusing variables as much as possible.
// Ensure proper use of __restrict__ to help compiler optimize memory access.
