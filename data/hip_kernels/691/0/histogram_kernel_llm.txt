```
// Consider using shared memory for histogram bins to reduce global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory histogram bins only if shared memory space is available
// Ensure __syncthreads() is called after writing to and before reading from shared memory
// Use atomic operations on shared memory to minimize contention
// Accumulate shared memory bins to global memory in parallel to reduce bottleneck
// Minimize the use of atomic operations on global memory by utilizing block-wise aggregation
