```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible.
// Minimize conditional statements inside loops for better performance.
// Use coalesced access patterns to global memory to enhance memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve loop execution and potentially reduce branching.
// Evaluate the impact of atomic operations if multiple threads might update the same memory location.
