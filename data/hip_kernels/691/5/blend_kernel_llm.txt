```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when possible.
// Reorder calculations to improve coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead for calculations within loops.
// Use a more efficient math library for frequently used math operations if available.
```
