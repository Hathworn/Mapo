```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within the same warp follow the same execution path.
// Align memory access patterns to improve coalesced memory reads and writes.
// Consider preloading data into registers for frequently accessed variables.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads to prevent race conditions.
