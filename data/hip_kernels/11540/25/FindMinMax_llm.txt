```cpp
// Consider coalescing global memory access for improved memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory efficiently by avoiding unnecessary reads and writes.
// Ensure proper use of __syncthreads() to prevent race conditions.
// Investigate ways to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Examine the possibility of loop unrolling for better performance in reduction.
// Opt for reducing the number of conditional statements inside the loop for efficiency.
// Aim to align data structures for optimal memory transactions.
