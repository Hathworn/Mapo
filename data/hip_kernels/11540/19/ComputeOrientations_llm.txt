// Ensure shared memory access patterns are coalesced for better efficiency.
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores to reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Optimize data access such that the number of global memory accesses is minimized.
// Precompute values if possible to reduce redundant computation within kernel.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could improve performance by minimizing loop overhead.
// Consider using atomic operations if histogram updates can be further optimized.
// Analyze if memory alignment can be improved to reduce access latency.
