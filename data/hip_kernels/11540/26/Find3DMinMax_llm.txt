```c
// Use memory coalescing to improve global memory access patterns
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use warp shuffle operations if available to reduce shared memory usage
// Adjust block size and grid dimensions to achieve optimal occupancy
// Utilize constant memory for frequently accessed constant data
```
