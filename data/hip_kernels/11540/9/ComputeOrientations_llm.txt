// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved performance
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize memory divergence
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size to help hide memory latency
// Use loop unrolling to improve performance in compute-intensive operations
