```
// Use coalesced memory access for loading data into shared memory
// Optimize data loading by avoiding individual boundary checks per thread
// Prefetch shared memory data for improved memory bank access
// Use loop unrolling to further reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure shared memory usage is fully optimized to avoid bank conflicts
