```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve bandwidth utilization
// Preload constant values into registers to avoid repeated global memory access
// Ensure enough threads per block to hide memory latency
// Minimize divergent branches to optimize execution flow
