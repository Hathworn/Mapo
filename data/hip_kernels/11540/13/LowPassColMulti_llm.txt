```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Try coalesced memory accesses for efficient memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure threads in a warp access sequential memory locations to improve performance.
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by loading data to shared memory once.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory.
