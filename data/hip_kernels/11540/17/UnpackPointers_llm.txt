// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align memory access to improve coalescing
// Ensure maxPts does not exceed shared memory limits to avoid overflow
// Process multiple elements per thread to increase computation bandwidth
// Reuse shared memory efficiently by minimizing redundant data reads
