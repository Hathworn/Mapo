```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data loads
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Precompute Gaussian values to avoid recalculating in each iteration
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have complete data before processing
// Avoid divergent branches by handling edge cases uniformly
// Load data into shared memory for reuse across threads
// Implement loop unrolling if possible for improved performance
// Use atomic operations with caution due to potential performance reduction
// Minimize use of expensive mathematical functions within critical loops
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns
// Consider occupancy and thread efficiency when setting block size
