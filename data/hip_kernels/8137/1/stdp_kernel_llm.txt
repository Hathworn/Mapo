```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling techniques to optimize loops if beneficial.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved bandwidth.
// Use a half warp for atomic operations, if necessary, to minimize contention.
// Evaluate potential bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns.
