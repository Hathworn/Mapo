```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data
// Implement memory coalescing strategies for accessing weight and history arrays
// Optimize thread block configuration to maximize SM occupancy and reduce warp divergence
// Use texture memory for read-only arrays like weight and history if beneficial
// Ensure alignment of data structures for better memory access performance
// Use appropriate launch configuration to match the specific L1 cache settings for this kernel
// Try using register blocking to improve data reuse within the kernel
