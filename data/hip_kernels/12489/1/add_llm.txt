// Ensure memory access is coalesced by using consecutive threads
// Leverage shared memory to minimize global memory bandwidth usage, if applicable
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching if overlapping data transfer and computation
// Balance the workload by configuring grid and block dimensions appropriately
