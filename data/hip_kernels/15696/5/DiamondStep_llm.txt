```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where applicable
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize computation time
// Align data accesses to memory banks to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize block and grid sizes according to the target architecture
