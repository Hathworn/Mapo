```
// Optimize memory access by coalescing reads from global memory
// Use shared memory for temporary storing if necessary to improve locality
// Consider using texture memory if read-only access is appropriate
// Investigate if ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism) can be maximized
// Ensure optimal block size for better occupancy and performance
