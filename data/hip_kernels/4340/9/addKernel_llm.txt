```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access when possible
// Explore using vectorized memory operations for better data throughput
// Adjust block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and performance based on specific GPU architecture
