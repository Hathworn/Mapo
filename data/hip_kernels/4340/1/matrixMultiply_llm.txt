```c
// Use vectorized memory loads for A and B for coalesced access
// Consider larger tile sizes to increase shared memory utilization
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() for better warp efficiency
// Optimize the loop unrolling factor based on hardware architecture
// Use constant memory if some matrices are constant throughout the computation
```
