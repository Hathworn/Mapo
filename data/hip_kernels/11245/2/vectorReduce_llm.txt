// Use coalesced memory access patterns when loading inputs into shared memory.
// Consider padding shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure shared memory arrays are sized to avoid excessive usage, possibly use dynamic allocation if available.
// Optimize the reduction loop by unrolling to improve performance.
