```
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory reads and writes.
// Check if loop unrolling techniques can improve throughput and reduce latency.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find the optimal configuration for the given hardware.
// Evaluate the use of half precision floating types if the accuracy requirements allow, to potentially increase performance.
