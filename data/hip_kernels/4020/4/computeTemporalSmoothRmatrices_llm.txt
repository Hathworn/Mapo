```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for Rmatrices to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory for temporal accumulation of R matrices to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergence within warps by ensuring consistent control flow amongst threads
// Ensure that data is aligned to achieve better memory access patterns
// Use appropriate memory prefetching techniques if possible
// Check for opportunities to unroll loops for increasing arithmetic intensity
