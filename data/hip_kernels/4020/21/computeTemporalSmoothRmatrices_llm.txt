```
// Consider increasing block size to improve occupancy and throughput.
// Use shared memory to store partial sums to reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize the warp execution efficiency by ensuring each warp processes contiguous data.
// coalesce global memory accesses in the 'for' loop to enhance memory bandwidth usage.
