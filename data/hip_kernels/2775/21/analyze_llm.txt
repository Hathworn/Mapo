```
// Load data into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Ensure all threads synchronize after initializing shared memory
// Use shared memory reduction to minimize global memory usage
// Begin reduction with blockDim.x/2 strides for efficiency
// Use atomic operations to safely update global memory
