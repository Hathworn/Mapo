```c
// Ensure global memory accesses are coalesced
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Use loop unrolling to enhance performance within the reduction loop
// Consider occupancy optimization by adjusting block and grid sizes
// Evaluate if the atomic operation can be minimized or replaced
```
