```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Load val into shared memory to avoid redundant global memory reads
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used for correct synchronization among threads
// Move printf outside performance-critical sections, ideally completely remove it from device code
// Investigate whether shared memory usage improves performance; if not, consider direct global memory writes
// Optimize block size for better memory coalescing and GPU occupancy
