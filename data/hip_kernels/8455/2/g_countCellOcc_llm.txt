```
// Consider memory coalescing to improve access speed when reading from _hash
// Utilize shared memory to reduce repeated access to the global memory
// Ensure that _hashCellCount is properly aligned to avoid un-coalesced access
// If possible, adjust block and grid sizes to ensure maximum occupancy
// Check for bank conflicts when accessing shared memory if implemented
