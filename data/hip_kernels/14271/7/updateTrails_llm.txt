```
// Use shared memory to cache repeatedly accessed data for faster access
// Ensure atomic operations are used for updating shared resources to maintain thread safety
// Consider splitting computation across threads to improve parallel execution efficiency
// Align memory accesses to improve coalesced memory access and reduce latency
// Optimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform execution paths across threads
// Minimize global memory bandwidth usage by caching more data in shared memory
