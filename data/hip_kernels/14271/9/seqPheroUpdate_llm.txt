```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when copying pheroReal to phero to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used correctly to avoid race conditions among threads.
// Reorganize the loops to improve load balance among threads.
// Consider using shared memory if the size of phero or parts of it can fit into it to reduce global memory traffic.
// Evaluate fusing loops to decrease kernel launch overhead.
// Perform bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds errors and potential race conditions.
// Use atomic operations cautiously and evaluate if they can be minimized for better performance.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance of the inner loop operations.
