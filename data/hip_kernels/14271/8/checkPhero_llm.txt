// Check for coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access, if applicable
// Ensure occupancy is maximized by using an optimal number of threads and blocks
// Avoid shared memory bank conflicts if shared memory is utilized
