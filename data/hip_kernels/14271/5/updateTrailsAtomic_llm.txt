```
// Consider coalesced memory access for the 'paths' array to improve performance.
// Ensure that the 'phero' array is aligned for optimal memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Assess the use of constant memory for 'QVAL' and potentially tour-related constants.
// Verify memory alignment for 'tourLengths' to minimize access latency.
