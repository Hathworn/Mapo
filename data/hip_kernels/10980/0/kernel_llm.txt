```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if applicable
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to improve performance
// Reduce warp divergence by minimizing conditional statements
// Consider increasing block size to improve occupancy if resources allow
```
