// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve performance
// Ensure correct index calculation to prevent out-of-bound errors
// Avoid bank conflicts by padding shared memory
// Swap indices when reading and writing to improve coalescing
// Employ __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within a block
