```
// Use shared memory for a and b if multiple accesses are needed to optimize memory bandwidth
// Consider using memory coalescing techniques to improve memory access efficiency
// Leverage vectorized operations if applicable for further optimization
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on specific GPU architecture for improved utilization
// Minimize divergent branches within warp execution where possible
// Store the intermediate results in registers if possible to reduce memory access overhead
```
