```
// Use __restrict__ to improve compiler optimization by assuming non-aliasing pointers
// Utilize shared memory for faster access and coalesced memory transactions
// Load elements from global to shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used to synchronize and avoid race conditions
