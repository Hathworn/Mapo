```
// Ensure nsamples is a multiple of nthreads * nblocks for coalesced memory access
// Use registers for thread_count instead of shared memory where possible
// Ensure x and y arrays are aligned to facilitate coalesced memory access
// Consider further unrolling the loop for idx < nsamples for better instruction parallelism
// Optimize memory access patterns by storing data in registers within the loop
