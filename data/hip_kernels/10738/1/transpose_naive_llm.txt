// Consider using shared memory to enhance memory coalescing and reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure that accesses within a warp are contiguous to maximize memory throughput.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads when necessary, especially when using shared memory.
// Optimize block size to match the warp size and the device's capabilities for maximal occupancy.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and enhance performance.
