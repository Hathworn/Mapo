```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to optimize global memory reads for x and y
// Prefetch data into shared memory if possible to reduce global memory latency
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring each thread follows similar execution paths
// Consider using warp-level primitives to accelerate the reduction across threads
// Avoid re-computation of globalId+i inside the loop by storing it in a local variable
