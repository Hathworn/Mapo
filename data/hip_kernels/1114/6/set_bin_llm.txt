```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_row_nz by optimizing the thread block size
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Minimize the use of atomic operations for improved performance
// Consider using warp-level primitives for operations on smaller data segments
