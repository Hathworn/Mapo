```
// Use coalesced memory access by organizing data in a structure-of-arrays format
// Leverage shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize branching by assigning results outside of conditional statements if feasible
// Adjust block and grid sizes to optimize occupancy and performance
// Prefetch data where possible to hide global memory latency
