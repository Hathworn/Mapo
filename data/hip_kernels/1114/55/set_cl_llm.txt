// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory efficiency
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data within the block
// Ensure proper thread synchronization when using shared memory
// Minimize divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency
// Investigate use of vectorized memory operations for efficiency
