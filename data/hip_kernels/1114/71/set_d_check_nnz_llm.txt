```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_nnz_num and d_check_nnz to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure d_nnz_num and d_check_nnz are allocated and accessed efficiently in device memory.
// Check if multiple threads are accessing the same element in d_check_nnz, which may lead to contention.
// Explore using shared memory if multiple threads in a block access common elements in d_nnz_num or d_check_nnz.
// Align data structures and thread access patterns to reduce uncoalesced global memory access.
