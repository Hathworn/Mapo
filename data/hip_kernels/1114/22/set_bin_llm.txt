```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_row_nz to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize the use of atomic operations if possible to reduce contention and improve performance
// Use shared memory for commonly accessed data within the block to reduce global memory access
// Explore warp-level primitives to handle bin assignment more efficiently
