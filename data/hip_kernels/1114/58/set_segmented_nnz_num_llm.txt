```
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_rpt and d_col to optimize global memory reads
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce the number of atomic operations needed
// Align seg_size and seg_num such that block accesses are optimized for cache coherence
// Evaluate if changing block and grid dimensions reduces the execution time
