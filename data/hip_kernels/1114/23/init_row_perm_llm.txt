```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Utilize shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same data to reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve memory load efficiency.
// Explore the use of warp-level primitives to optimize performance for reduction or sorting operations within the kernel.
