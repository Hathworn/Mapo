```c
// Consider aligning memory accesses to coalesce global memory transactions.
// Avoid divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Preload d_gcs into shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize the number of global memory accesses by combining reads or writes where feasible.
// Investigate using texture memory for potentially cache-friendly read access.
