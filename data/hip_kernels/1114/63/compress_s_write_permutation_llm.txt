```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to d_write_permutation
// Use shared memory for d_s_write_permutation if data reuse is possible within a block
// Ensure accesses to d_s_write_permutation_offset are coalesced across different chunks
// Optimize conditions to avoid warp divergence, particularly in the conditional statements
// Check if loop unrolling could improve performance by reducing the total number of iterations
