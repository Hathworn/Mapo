```
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Unroll loops where applicable to reduce loop control overhead
// Consider using shared memory if data is reused within a block
// Minimize costly global memory accesses by maximizing use of registers
// Align data structures in a way that matches GPU architecture for better memory throughput
