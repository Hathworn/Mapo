```
// Consider using shared memory to cache sections of d_row_nz to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate if using warp-level primitives can further reduce atomic operations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to optimize bandwidth utilization.
// Analyze potential benefits of using local memory for repeated small data access.
