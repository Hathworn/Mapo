```
// Ensure proper memory alignment to improve load and store efficiency
// Use shared memory if the same data is accessed multiple times by threads
// Consider vectorized memory access patterns for better throughput
// Minimize atomic operations by batch processing or using warp-level primitives
// Avoid divergent branches or group threads with similar execution paths
// Use warp-level intrinsics to optimize synchronization and data exchange
// Schedule threads to maximize occupancy while minimizing memory latency
