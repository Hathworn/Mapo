```cpp
// Consider using more shared memory for larger data sets to minimize global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory coalescing by aligning data structures to warp boundaries.
// Prefetch next data chunk into shared memory to hide global memory access latency.
// Balance memory and computation by determining optimum block size.
// Implement vectorized loading and storing to increase memory throughput if applicable.
