```c
// Use coalesced memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth
// Ensure all threads of a warp access continuous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize repeated access
// Implement loop unrolling if setting multiple adjacent elements
// Prefer using __syncthreads() if synchronization is required after modifications
```
