```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for u, v, and src to improve memory efficiency.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible.
// Consider loop unrolling for accessing neighboring pixels if operation is repetitive.
// Prefetch data when possible to hide global memory latency.
