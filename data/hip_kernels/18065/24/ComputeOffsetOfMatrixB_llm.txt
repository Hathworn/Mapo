```cpp
// Ensure that the access pattern is coalesced for optimal global memory access
// Consider employing shared memory or registers to minimize global memory bandwidth
// Align data structures to cache line sizes if possible for better performance
// Minimize the number of global memory transactions by reducing divergent access
```
