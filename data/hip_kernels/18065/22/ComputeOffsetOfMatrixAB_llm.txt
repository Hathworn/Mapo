```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for row_sum and col_sum to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Ensure output memory writes are coalesced by aligning idx calculation with warp boundaries
// Use shared memory to cache row_sum and col_sum values within each block, reducing global memory accesses
// Verify that the threadIdx.x access pattern does not cause memory bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Explore double-buffering shared memory to overlap computation and memory transfers for better performance
