```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing sequential memory addresses
// Use __restrict__ keyword to provide compiler hints for optimization
// Consider using shared memory if there is reuse of data between threads
// Prefetch data into registers to hide global memory latency
// Tune block and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy and performance
// Profile kernel to identify and eliminate memory access bottlenecks
