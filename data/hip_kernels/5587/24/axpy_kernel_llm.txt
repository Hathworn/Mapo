```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access for X and Y
// Consider using shared memory or cache to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Utilize loop unrolling techniques to increase instruction level parallelism
// Try to minimize register usage for better occupancy
// Ensure aligned data access to maximize memory throughput
