```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache values that are accessed by all threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loop to improve performance.
// Ensure data alignment to avoid misaligned memory accesses which can degrade performance.
// Preload data to registers to reduce the number of memory accesses inside the loop.
// Avoid branch divergence by structuring conditions uniformly across threads.
