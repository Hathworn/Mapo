```
// Consider using shared memory to store data chunks of pred and truth to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring pred and truth arrays are accessed in a sequential manner for each thread
// Utilize __syncthreads() to coordinate memory reads/writes in shared memory, if shared memory is implemented
// Ensure that the error and delta computations are executed with minimal branching to maintain warp efficiency
// Investigate possible loop unrolling or vectorized operations for performance enhancement, if applicable
