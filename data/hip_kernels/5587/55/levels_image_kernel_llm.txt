```
// Consider optimizing global memory accesses by coalescing them.
// Use shared memory to load image data within a block to reduce global memory access latency.
// Perform arithmetic intensity operations such as scaling and shift adjustments after coalesced reads.
// Apply loop unrolling if the process involves repeated operations on the image channel data.
// Ensure that computation steps maintain their independence to minimize serialization among threads.
// If possible, use texture memory for image data to benefit from cached reads.
// Minimize divergent control flows, especially within the RGB to HSV conversion process.
