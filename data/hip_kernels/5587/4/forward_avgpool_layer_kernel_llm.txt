// Consider memory coalescing by accessing input and output arrays in a stride order that maximizes efficiency.
// Utilize shared memory to store blocks of input data temporarily, which can reduce global memory access.
// Optimize loop unrolling further by applying techniques such as loop tiling for better cache usage.
// Use warp-level primitives to perform reductions more efficiently within each block.
