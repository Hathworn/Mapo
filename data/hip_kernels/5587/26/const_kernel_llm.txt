```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for optimal memory bandwidth utilization
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the best occupancy and performance balance
// Ensure ALPHA is placed in shared memory if reused across threads for faster access
// Use __restrict__ qualifier if applicable for pointers to signal no overlapping in memory
// Prefetch or cache X values in shared memory if there are multiple operations per element
