```
// Use shared memory access patterns to avoid frequent global memory access.
// Minimize synchronization overhead by reducing the number of __syncthreads() calls.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for input and output arrays.
// Evaluate if atomic operations can be replaced or minimized for performance gains.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction operations instead of block-level atomic operations.
// Assess potential performance improvements by experimenting with different block and grid dimensions.
