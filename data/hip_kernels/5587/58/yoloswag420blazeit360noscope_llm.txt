```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring input and rand arrays are accessed sequentially.
// Leverage shared memory if any repeated computations or data reuse are needed in future extensions.
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size for potential warp-level optimizations.
// Ensure memory access patterns minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing the use of temporary variables if possible.
