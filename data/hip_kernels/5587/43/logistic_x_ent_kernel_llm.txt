```
// Use blockDim.x to maximise parallel workload and reduce iteration overhead
// Utilize gridStride loops for better data access patterns and reduced memory latency
// Ensure continuous memory access to boost memory throughput
// Minimize branching in computation to increase warp execution efficiency
