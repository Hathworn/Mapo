```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for threads within the same block to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize thread block size and grid size for better occupancy.
// Avoid warp divergence by ensuring all threads execute the same control flow path as much as possible.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to potentially improve performance.
