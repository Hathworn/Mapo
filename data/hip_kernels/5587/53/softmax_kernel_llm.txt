```
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access
// Employ atomic functions cautiously to prevent performance bottlenecks
// Consider replacing atomicMax and atomicAdd with parallel reduction for performance improvement
// Ensure coalesced memory access by appropriately aligning input and output data
// Balance workload among threads to maximize resource utilization
// Minimize synchronization overhead by optimizing __syncthreads usage
