```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by checking and aligning memory if possible
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to hint to the compiler that pointers do not alias
// Minimize data transfer by storing frequently accessed elements in shared memory if beneficial
// Unroll loops when possible to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Evaluate the benefits of prefetching data into registers to reduce memory latency
// Consider increasing block size for improved occupancy if registers and shared memory allow
```
