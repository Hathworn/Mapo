```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for x, y, z arrays.
// Ensure valid_points array is accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Use shared memory to store reusable data for h_ang to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using double buffering if applicable for overlapping memory transfer and computation.
// Optimize loop stride to enhance memory access patterns.
// Minimize the use of global memory within the loop by storing frequently accessed data in registers.
// Verify if the usage of __syncthreads() is redundant and remove if unnecessary.
