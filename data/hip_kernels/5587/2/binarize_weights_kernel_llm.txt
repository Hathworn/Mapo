```
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to avoid shared memory bottlenecks.
// Use __shfl_xor for efficient mean calculation across threads in a warp.
// Use cooperative_groups for flexible memory access patterns.
// Minimize global memory access by increasing data locality.
// Use float4 or float2 for vectorized access to optimize memory transfers.
