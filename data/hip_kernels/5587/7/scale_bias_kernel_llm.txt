```
// Consider using shared memory for biases to reduce global memory access times.
// Preload biases into shared memory at the beginning of the kernel.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the output array.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Minimize the number of calculations inside the loop, e.g., calculate (batch * n + filter) * size outside the loop if possible.
