// Unroll the main loop to reduce control overhead and improve performance
// Replace nested loops with single loops to improve memory access patterns
// Use precomputed expressions to reduce redundant calculations
// Use max/min functions to clamp ranges and avoid unnecessary computations
// Unroll inner loops for better performance and reduced loop control overhead
