```cpp
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer declarations to optimize memory access
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and minimize memory latency
// Ensure data alignment for coalesced memory access and improved memory throughput
```
