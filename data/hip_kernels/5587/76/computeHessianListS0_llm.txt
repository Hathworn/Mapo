// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables like trans_x, trans_y, trans_z
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers when possible
// Reduce stride loop overhead by optimizing loop execution and minimizing index calculations
// Consider warp-based optimizations for better utilization of compute resources
