```cpp
// Cache centroid_x, centroid_y, centroid_z for each thread to reduce repetitive global memory accesses
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data such as e_x_cov_x and cov_dxd_pi to decrease global memory latency
// Consider loop unrolling to improve instruction level parallelism in the inner loop
// Minimize conditional checks inside the loop by handling them outside if possible
// Align memory access patterns to improve coalescing for trans_x, trans_y, trans_z, and valid_points
