```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring that INCX is 1
// Ensure stride access pattern is optimal for the target architecture
// Align data pointers to reduce memory access latency
// Use shared memory if ALPHA is repeatedly accessed by multiple threads
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy and performance
