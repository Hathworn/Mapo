```
// Consider using shared memory to store blocks of data for coalesced access
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses within the warp
// Optimize for memory latency by overlapping computation and data transfer
// Evaluate the impact of different block sizes on memory bandwidth and performance
