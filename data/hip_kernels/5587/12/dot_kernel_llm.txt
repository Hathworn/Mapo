```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data into shared memory for faster access
// Minimize computation by using shared memory for norms and sums
// Reduce redundant global memory reads by storing intermediate values in shared memory
// Optimize loop to avoid multiples accesses to global memory for same data
