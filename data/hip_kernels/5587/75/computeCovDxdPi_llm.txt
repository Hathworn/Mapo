```
// Process only necessary rows and columns to reduce workload
// Ensure coalesced memory access by arranging icov and voxel_id loading
// Optimize memory access pattern in the inner loop for cov_dxd_pi_tmp
// Unrolling loop for better performance to enhance instruction throughput
// Efficiently access memory by storing starting voxel index once
// Minimize memory access latency by using one-load-per-access for voxel ids
