```c
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring that global memory accesses are sequential if possible.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data reuse.
// Optimize thread block size to ensure high occupancy and effective use of GPU resources.
// Ensure that data access patterns minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Experiment with loop unrolling factors to find optimal performance based on hardware capabilities.
