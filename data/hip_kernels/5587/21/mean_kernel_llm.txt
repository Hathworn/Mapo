// Consider prefetching data to improve memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory for partial sums to improve bandwidth efficiency.
// Explore vectorization of loads and stores for x and mean arrays.
// Ensure correct memory alignment to facilitate coalesced accesses.
// Investigate occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes accordingly.
// Enable compiler flags for maximum optimization.
