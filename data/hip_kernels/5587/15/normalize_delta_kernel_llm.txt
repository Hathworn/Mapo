```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Load shared variables at the beginning of the block to decrease repeated memory accesses
// Synchronize threads after loading shared memory to ensure all threads have access to the updated values
// Calculate and cache the norm_variance to avoid repeated computation within the loop
