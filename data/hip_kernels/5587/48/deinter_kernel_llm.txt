// Consider aligning data structures to improve memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic and improve memory access latency
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance the performance by reducing loop overhead
// Assess data coalescing to ensure that threads access consecutive memory locations
