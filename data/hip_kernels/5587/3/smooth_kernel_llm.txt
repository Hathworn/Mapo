```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Align memory accesses to improve memory coalescing and reduce transaction overhead.
// Avoid using dynamic indexing within loops to maximize memory access efficiency.
// Explore loop unrolling for small fixed-size loops to increase instruction level parallelism.
