// Consider using shared memory for common variables to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads from global memory.
// Use register variables to store intermediate calculation results.
// Explore loop unrolling to improve performance.
// Ensure data alignment to maximize memory throughput.
