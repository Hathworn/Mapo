```
// Consider memory access pattern for coalescing
// Ensure X is aligned to improve memory access efficiency
// Evaluate if INCX usage could be leading to uncoalesced memory access
// Try using shared memory if there are frequent access patterns that can be reused within a block
// Investigate if compiler flags to improve cache utilization are being used
