```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Align data structures to 128-byte boundaries to maximize memory bandwidth usage
// Use fewer global memory reads by packing data into structures where possible
// Limit the usage of shared memory to essential variables to avoid bank conflicts
// Reduce register usage by optimizing the application's arithmetic expressions
