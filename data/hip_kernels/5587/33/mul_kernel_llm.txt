```
// Consider coalescing memory access for X and Y to improve memory bandwidth.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if data reuse is possible to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure INCX and INCY are set to promote coalesced access patterns for higher performance.
// Explore usage of __restrict__ qualifier to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Make sure grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency.
// Use native vector types if appropriate for this operation to enhance throughput.
