```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for mean values
// Ensure thread synchronization after loading mean into shared memory
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Check bounds when accessing global memory to prevent out-of-bounds access
