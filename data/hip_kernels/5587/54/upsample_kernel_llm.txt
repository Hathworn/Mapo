```
// Consider replacing atomicAdd with more efficient memory access to minimize contention in backward pass
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning output indexes for better memory throughput
// Optimize utilization of shared memory to reduce global memory traffic when accessing frequently used data
// Implement warp-level primitives to further enhance parallel execution and manage divergent branches
// Explore loop unrolling techniques if applicable for improved instruction-level parallelism
