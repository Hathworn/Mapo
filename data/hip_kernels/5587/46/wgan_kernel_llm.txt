```cpp
// Use shared memory to store pred and truth values to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve memory access patterns.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by aligning conditions and branches.
// Optimize thread block size for better performance and resource utilization.
