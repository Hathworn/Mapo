```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to reduce memory latency
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory bandwidth
// Apply loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Utilize warp-level synchronization functions like __shfl_sync for intra-warp communication
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead
