```
// Consider using shared memory for block-level cache of row_sum to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for the output array by successive threads.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads in a block if shared memory is utilized.
// Optimize block size based on the device's compute capability and workload characteristics.
