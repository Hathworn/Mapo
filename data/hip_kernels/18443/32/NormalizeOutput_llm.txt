// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Reduce register pressure by minimizing variable declarations within the loop
// Implement loop unrolling to enhance performance by decreasing the loop overhead
// Evaluate using warp-wide operations where possible to leverage parallel computation
