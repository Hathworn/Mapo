```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses when reading from col_sum
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency, if applicable
// Ensure block size is a multiple of warp size for optimal performance
// Assess if memory access pattern aligns with GPU memory architecture
// Minimize divergence to reduce warp serialization
```
