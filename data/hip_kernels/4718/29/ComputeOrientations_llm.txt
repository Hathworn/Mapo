```
// Consider using float4 to load four float elements at once for coalesced memory access
// Ensure Gaussian weights are precomputed outside of loops for better efficiency
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to potentially improve compiler optimizations
// Consider using warp-level primitives instead of block-wide synchronization for reductions
// Use shared memory efficiently by reducing loading redundancies in shared memory based on thread access patterns
