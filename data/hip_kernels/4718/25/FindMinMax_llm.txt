```cpp
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced memory access.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Loop unrolling applied to minimize branch divergence.
// Handle out-of-bound accesses gracefully to prevent unnecessary computations.
// Use shared memory for parallel reduction to minimize synchronization overhead.
