```
// Use shared memory efficiently by reducing its footprint with the help of registers.
// Minimize global memory access by using local registers for temporary storage.
// Use warp-level primitives such as __shfl or __ballot for intra-warp communication to reduce __syncthreads frequency.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by appropriately indexing and aligning data.
// Reduce the usage of shared memory to optimize bandwidth by relying on registers where possible.
// Limit the use of __syncthreads to points where absolutely necessary.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize the thread block size to fully utilize GPU cores and memory bandwidth.
