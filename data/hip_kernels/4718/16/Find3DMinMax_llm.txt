```
// Use shared memory to cache data for faster access and reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure threads synchronize after loading data into shared memory to prevent race conditions.
// Use warp-level optimizations by accessing memory positions based on WARP_SIZE.
// Implement memory coalescing by aligning threads' memory accesses to avoid serialization.
// Avoid unnecessary calculations outside of valid x range to reduce computation overhead.
// Restrict thread computations and output updating to clamped and valid x positions.
// Reduce conditional branching to optimize kernel execution time.
