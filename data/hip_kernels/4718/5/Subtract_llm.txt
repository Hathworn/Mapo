```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by using a linear index
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time
// Ensure pitch alignment is optimized for memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts
// Minimize divergence by ensuring both threads within warps enter the same branch
// Consider prefetching data into registers to reduce latency if computational intensity allows
// Profile memory access patterns to identify and optimize cache usage
