```
// Consider using loop unrolling to improve performance in the loop for loading data into shared memory
// Ensure proper occupancy by choosing optimal block size while considering shared memory structure
// Experiment with different values for blockDim.y to balance between loads into shared memory and computation efficiency
// Ensure that the use of shared memory does not exceed the limits per block, optimize shared memory usage
// Align data structures and accesses to prevent memory bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like kernel if possible to benefit from cache memory
