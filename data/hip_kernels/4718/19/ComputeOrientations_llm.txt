```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory by aligning data properly.
// Consider loop unrolling for loading data into shared memory to reduce overhead.
// Use efficient boundary checks to minimize thread divergence.
// Precompute Gaussian values to reuse and reduce repeated calculations.
// Leverage shared memory for histograms to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize histogram accumulation with loop unrolling to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Consider warp-level operations (e.g., shuffle) to optimize peak finding and reduce sync points.
