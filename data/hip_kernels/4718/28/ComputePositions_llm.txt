```
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Ensure all global memory accesses are coalesced.
// Minimize the use of divergent branches to optimize warp execution.
// Precompute invariant expressions outside the loop to minimize unnecessary recalculation.
// Reduce arithmetic redundancy by reusing computed variables wherever possible.
// Evaluate the cost of __fdividef and consider replacing with multiplication when the division is by a constant.
