```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache the data accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Ensure that global memory accesses are coalesced to increase memory throughput.
// Limit the number of memory transactions per thread by using efficient memory access patterns.
// Minimize the use of conditional statements within the loop to reduce control divergence.
// Optimize the calculation of indices to avoid redundant operations and improve efficiency.
// Consider loop unrolling if the compiler does not automatically optimize it.
