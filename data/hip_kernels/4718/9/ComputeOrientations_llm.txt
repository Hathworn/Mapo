// Consider further optimization of shared memory usage by reducing data size if possible.
// Evaluate if the range and binning of the histogram can be improved for memory access patterns.
// Explore loop unrolling strategies in the gradient computation loop to enhance performance.
// Check potential opportunities for asynchronous computation to overlap with computes.
// Analyze if atomic operations can be avoided or reduced to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Assess the possibility of merging the histogram peak detection and orientation computation stages.
