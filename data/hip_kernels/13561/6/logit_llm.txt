// Consider using shared memory for repeated calculations to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns in the stride loop to enhance coalescing
// Verify if memory access can be aligned to improve performance
// Consider loop unrolling to increase computational throughput
// Evaluate the use of constant memory for fixed parameters or coefficients
