// Use shared memory for repeated data access to reduce global memory transactions
// Minimize register usage by reducing variable lifetime and using appropriate data types
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for efficient data sharing among threads within a warp
// Evaluate occupancy by adjusting the number of threads per block and the launch bounds settings
