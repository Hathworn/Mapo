```
// Consider memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency
// Use shared memory for frequently used data to minimize global memory reads
// Perform data prefetching to optimize memory access patterns
// Examine whether reducing the number of memory transactions could improve performance
// Investigate the use of texture memory for read-only data to speed up access
