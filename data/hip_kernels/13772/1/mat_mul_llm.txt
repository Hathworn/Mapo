// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for loading tiles into shared memory.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
// Use loop unrolling for the computation loop to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Implement global memory prefetching to hide memory latency and reduce stalls.
// Explore potential benefits of using different block sizes for better occupancy and performance.
