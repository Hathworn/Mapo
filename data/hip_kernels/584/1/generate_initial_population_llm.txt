```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures appropriately
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve throughput and reduce latency
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory traffic
// Consider loop unrolling for the for-loop to enhance parallel execution efficiency
// Strive for balanced workload distribution across threads and blocks
