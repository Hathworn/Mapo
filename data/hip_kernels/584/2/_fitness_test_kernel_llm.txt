```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses.
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data.
// Minimize global memory accesses by caching data in registers.
// Ensure kernel launch configuration uses appropriate block and thread size.
// Use constant memory for data that does not change during kernel execution.
