```
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for better ILP and reducing loop overhead
// Pre-fetch memory during complex calculations to minimize latency
