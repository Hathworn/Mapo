```
// Consider coalesced memory access by adjusting row size
// Use shared memory to cache input data and reduce global memory access
// Prefer warp size for block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Ensure memory alignment to improve throughput
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel for better performance
