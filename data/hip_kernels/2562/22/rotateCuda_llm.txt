```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for both input and output arrays
// Align input and output arrays to avoid unaligned accesses
// Leverage shared memory to cache portions of the input image
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Preload input values into registers for frequently accessed data
// Ensure the use of 32-bit variables for index calculations to exploit hardware capabilities
// Unroll loops where applicable to reduce loop overhead and enhance pipeline utilization
