```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and atomic operations
// Align shared memory size with block dimensions for optimal utilization
// Atomic operations on shared memory are generally faster than on global memory
// Ensure shared memory size (e.g., 256) adequately matches blockDim for efficiency
