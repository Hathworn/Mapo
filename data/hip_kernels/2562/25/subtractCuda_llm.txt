// Coalesce memory access by aligning thread indices with data structures.
// Minimize shared memory use, aiming to avoid extra allocations.
// Ensure vectorized operations if possible to increase throughput.
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed constants or coefficients.
// Explore warp-level primitives to reduce divergence in conditional operations.
// Optimize stride access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory.
