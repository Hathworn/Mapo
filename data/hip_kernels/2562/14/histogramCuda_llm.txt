```c
// Reduce memory latency by storing frequently accessed values in registers.
// Calculate thread indices outside of loops for efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for data to improve performance.
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory traffic.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques if applicable, for further optimization.
// Use warp-level primitives for collective histogram updates if supported.
