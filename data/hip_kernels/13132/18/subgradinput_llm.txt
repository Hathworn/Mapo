```
// Consider using shared memory to cache weight values if reused
// Prefetch data into shared memory for gradOutput to reduce access latency
// Use const/restrict qualifiers to help compiler optimize memory access
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for data alignment
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for gradInput/gradOutput
// Try loop unrolling for both ky and kx for better performance
