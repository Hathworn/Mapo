```
// Precompute values that are used multiple times to reduce redundant calculations
// Avoid using float division inside loops for performance improvement
// Consider using shared memory if accessing the same data multiple times to reduce global memory access
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Minimize the use of atomic operations as they can serialize execution
