```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for gradOutput and indices to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to store per-block results to reduce global memory access and improve performance.
// Optimize the loop to reduce the number of arithmetic operations inside it.
// Ensure that atomic operations do not become a bottleneck by analyzing if warp divergence occurs.
