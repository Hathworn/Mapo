// Consider coalesced memory access for ptr_input by aligning data access patterns
// Consider coalesced memory access for ptr_gradOutput by aligning data access patterns
// Use shared memory to store input data slice that is reused across threads 
// Minimize global memory access by loading gradOutput values per block
// Consider preloading gradOutput values to registers for repeated use
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Use warp-synchronous reduction to reduce shared memory accesses for partial sum reduction
