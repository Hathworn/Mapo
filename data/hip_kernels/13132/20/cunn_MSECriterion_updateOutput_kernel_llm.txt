```
// Consider using shared memory effectively to store intermediate results and minimize global memory access.
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Implement a more efficient parallel reduction technique to reduce latency and divergence.
// Minimize divergence by organizing threads so that conditional branches are avoided or minimized.
// Analyze if loop unrolling can enhance performance by allowing the compiler to optimize loop overhead.
// Ensure that buffer initialization and usage respect shared memory bank conflicts to improve performance.
