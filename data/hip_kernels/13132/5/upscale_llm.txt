```
// Consider using shared memory for data reuse to minimize global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by adjusting data layout or access patterns.
// Ensure memory access patterns take advantage of L2 cache lines.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to further enhance performance.
// Evaluate the possibility of occupancy optimization by adjusting block size.
// Consider the use of asynchronous memory prefetching if beneficial.
