// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to increase memory throughput
// Use shared memory to cache  frequently used data, if applicable
// Ensure alignment for memory accesses to improve performance
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling for the feature processing loop
// Prefetch gradOutput_data and indices_data values to reduce memory latency
