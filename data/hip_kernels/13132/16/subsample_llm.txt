```c
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for input data.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance for small kernel sizes.
// Align memory accesses to optimize coalesced memory access patterns.
// Prefetch data to hide memory latency through pipelining.
// Minimize register pressure by optimizing the number of registers used per thread.
```
