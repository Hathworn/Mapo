// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning thread and data structures
// Consider loop unrolling to improve pipelining and reduce loop overhead
// Use const memory for frequently accessed but unchanged data
// Ensure optimal block size for memory and computational efficiency
// Minimize use of atomic operations to avoid serialization of threads
