```
// Consider coalesced memory access for gradInput, output, and gradOutput arrays.
// Use shared memory to store gradients for each block to reduce global memory access.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by aligning data access patterns.
// Ensure computational intensity is high to balance memory access latency.
// Optimize parallel reduction to prevent idle threads and improve efficiency.
// Explore loop unrolling for the inner loops to enhance performance.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for faster data reduction.
