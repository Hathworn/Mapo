```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate computations to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Align data loads and stores to widths of 32, 64, or 128 bytes for improved performance
// Use memory prefetch techniques if applicable
// Consider thread block size adjustments for maximizing occupancy and reducing idle threads
// Review unroll factors to ensure they're optimal for current hardware architecture
// Ensure correct usage of volatile keyword if necessary to avoid stale data issues in register usage
