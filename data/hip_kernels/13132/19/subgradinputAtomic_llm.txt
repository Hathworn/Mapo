```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for gradInput and gradOutput.
// Minimize stride in memory accesses to enhance memory coalescing.
// Evaluate memory access patterns to exploit cache efficiently.
// Identify if shared memory can be used to avoid redundant global memory reads.
// Reduce divergent branches to ensure warp efficiency.
// Analyze and improve memory locality to reduce memory access latency.
