```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for better performance.
// Align data structures to 128-byte for optimal memory transactions.
// Ensure global memory reads and writes are coalesced.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible.
// Optimize scale_factor computation to avoid redundant division operations.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring warp-level execution consistency.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for better occupancy.
