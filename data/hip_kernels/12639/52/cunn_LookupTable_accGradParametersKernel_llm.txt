```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branching within the same warp to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Implement loop unrolling for the innermost loop to increase ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Use appropriate data prefetchnig strategies to hide memory latency.
