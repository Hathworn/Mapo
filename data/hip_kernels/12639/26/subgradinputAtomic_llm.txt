```
// Optimize memory access by unrolling kH and kW loops for coalesced access patterns
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for target hardware for best performance
// Consider using shared memory to further optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Minimize atomic operations in inner loops to reduce contention and increase performance
// Assess thread occupancy to ensure efficient utilization of GPU resources
