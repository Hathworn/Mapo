// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking memory alignment for gradOutput_data
// Minimize divergent branches, especially in for loops
// Explore loop unrolling for the inner loop to increase throughput
// Check if atomic operations are necessary during accumulation to avoid data races
