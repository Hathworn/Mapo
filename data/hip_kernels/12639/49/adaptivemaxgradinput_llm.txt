```c
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput if its size is small enough
// Use shared memory to cache indices_x and indices_y to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced access patterns for gradInput to maximize memory throughput
// Ensure ptr_gradInput, ptr_gradOutput, ptr_ind_x, ptr_ind_y pointers are aligned for optimal access
// Utilize loop unrolling to improve compute efficiency within the nested loops
```
