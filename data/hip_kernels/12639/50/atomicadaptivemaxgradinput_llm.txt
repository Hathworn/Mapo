```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for gradOutput, gradInput, indices_x, and indices_y
// Use shared memory where possible to store temporary variables
// Minimize the number of indirect accesses and calculations inside the for-loops
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned when possible to increase efficiency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling would benefit performance for the inner loop over 'xx'
