```
// Consider increasing memory coalescing by aligning memory access patterns for gradOutput
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores to enhance memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory more extensively by loading a block of gradOutput into shared memory
// Investigate loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in iterating over kernel dimensions
// Look into using texture or surface memory for gradOutput to benefit from cached reads
// Optimize thread block size to ensure maximum occupancy and better utilization of the GPU
