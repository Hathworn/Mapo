```
// Consider coalesced memory access for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure that indices_data is accessed in a coalesced manner to enhance memory throughput.
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and fully utilize GPU cores.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage to maximize performance.
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop to enhance execution efficiency.
// Profile the use of atomicAdd to understand its impact on performance; consider alternative reduction strategies if it becomes a bottleneck.
