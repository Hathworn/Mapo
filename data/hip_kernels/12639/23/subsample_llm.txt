```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache input data within a block to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Check if input and output arrays can be aligned for potentially better memory access patterns.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques for the innermost loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure that all threads in a warp are active when accessing memory to avoid divergence.
// Evaluate different thread block sizes for optimal occupancy and performance.
