// Consider using shared memory for data that is accessed multiple times
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Utilize vectorized load and store operations where possible for efficient memory access
// Minimize divergent branching to improve warp efficiency
// Optimize block and thread configurations to maximize GPU utilization
