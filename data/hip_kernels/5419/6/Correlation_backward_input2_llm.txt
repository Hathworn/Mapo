// Consider coalesced memory access for rInput1 and gradOutput arrays to reduce latency
// Use shared memory effectively to store frequently accessed data
// Optimize with vectorized loads and stores where possible
// Minimize divergent branches in loop and conditional structures
// Adjust block size and grid dimensions to ensure optimal occupancy
