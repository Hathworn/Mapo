```
// Consider using memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses for gradOutput and rInput2.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing shared memory bank conflicts.
// Evaluate constant memory use for stride and dimension variables for faster access.
// Consider loop unrolling further in the nested loops to enhance throughput.
// Implement thread synchronization efficiently to avoid potential data races.
