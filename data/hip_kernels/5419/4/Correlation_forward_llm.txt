```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for rInput1 and rInput2 to maximize coalesced reads.
// Investigate using shared memory more efficiently to cache data from global memory.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by appropriate padding if necessary.
// Ensure that the access pattern minimizes warp divergence, especially in the displacement and kernel loops.
// Assess potential benefits of loop unrolling for the kernel_radius and displacement loops.
// Avoid redundant calculations by pre-computing invariant expressions outside loops.
// Check if the reduction step can be improved by employing parallel reduction techniques.
