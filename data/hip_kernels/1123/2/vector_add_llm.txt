```
// Ensure shared memory size matches block size to avoid excess allocation
// Consider coalesced access patterns when loading to shared memory
// Minimize memory divergence by using consistent data access pattern across threads
// Reduce __syncthreads() usage if overlapping operations are possible
// Ensure workload balance by assigning optimal block and grid sizes
