```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory with warp size
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use __restrict__ to enable compiler optimizations by indicating no aliasing
// Check memory access pattern to prevent bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize global memory latency
