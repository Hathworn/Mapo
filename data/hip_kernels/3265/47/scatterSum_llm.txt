```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for input data to improve memory throughput
// Minimize the use of atomic operations as they can serialize access and reduce parallel efficiency
// Evaluate if using shared memory could further reduce redundant memory accesses
// Experiment with larger block sizes or different grid configurations to increase occupancy
