```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve performance
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Reduce memory divergence by ensuring threads access continuous memory chunks
// Ensure occupancy by optimizing block and grid size based on device properties
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize intra-warp operations
```
