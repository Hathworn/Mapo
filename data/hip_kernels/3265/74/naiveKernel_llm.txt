```
// Consider aligning shared memory usage to warp size for better performance
// Load data into shared memory in coalesced manner to optimize global memory bandwidth
// Reduce redundant memory access by reusing values from shared memory
// Ensure the number of threads per block is optimized for the specific GPU architecture
// Minimize use of __syncthreads() as it can introduce unnecessary synchronization overhead
