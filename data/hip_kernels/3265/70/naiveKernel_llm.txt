```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Consider block size to match shared memory size for optimal performance
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have written to shared memory before proceeding
// Optimize the loop to minimize redundant memory reads from shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance in the sum calculation
