```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to store data blocks and reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure proper synchronization to prevent data hazards when using shared memory.
// Load data into shared memory in chunks to make memory access patterns more efficient.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and potentially increase performance.
// Make sure threads access memory in an aligned manner to fully utilize memory bandwidth.
