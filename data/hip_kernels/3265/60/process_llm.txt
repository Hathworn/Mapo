```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to increase efficiency
// Ensure that shared memory reads/writes are well-aligned
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide latency
// Use loop unrolling for the accumulation loop if possible
// Evaluate memory access patterns for strided access optimization
