```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Minimize memory transactions by using shared memory where applicable
// Ensure data alignment to optimize global memory throughput
// Employ thread coarsening to reduce loop overhead and increase parallelism
// Implement occupancy considerations to achieve optimal resource usage
// Assess potential use of asynchronous memory copy and streams for better overlap of computation and communication
