```
// Consider memory coalescing to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize the use of atomic operations or use more efficient atomic operations
// Explore warp-level parallelism to enhance performance
// Align data structures to natural memory boundaries for better access patterns
