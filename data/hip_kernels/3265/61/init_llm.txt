// Add memory coalescing strategies by aligning data structures to ensure contiguous memory access.
// Avoid warp divergence by minimizing conditional statements within the kernel.
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency.
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to balance computation and memory throughput.
