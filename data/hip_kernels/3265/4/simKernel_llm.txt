```
// Use shared memory to cache mid and gap values within each block to reduce global memory access
// Ensure data alignment for coalesced memory access when fetching alpha and mid values
// Minimize divergent branches in condition checks by simplifying the logic
// Group arithmetic operations to reduce the number of operations and improve efficiency
// Strive for loop unrolling where beneficial to maximize parallel execution
// Consider using atomic operations for the prof updates to ensure correctness
