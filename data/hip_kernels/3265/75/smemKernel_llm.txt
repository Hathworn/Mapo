```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Resetting output array once can save unnecessary write operations during iterations
// Load data into shared memory in chunks to improve memory coalescing and access efficiency
// Normalize final output outside of the loop to minimize redundant calculations
// Ensure synchronization with __syncthreads() to handle shared memory correctly
