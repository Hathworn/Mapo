```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Ensure loop unrolling for the accumulation loop to enhance performance
// Utilize warp-level primitives if applicable for efficient summation
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads within a warp execute similar instructions
