```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure memory alignment to leverage the full bandwidth of global memory.
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads within a block access the same data.
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data loaded into registers/local memory.
