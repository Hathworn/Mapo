```
// Use shared memory to cache lifter coefficients, minimizing global memory access.
// Ensure memory alignment for better coalesced memory access.
// Consider using a stride loop for better cache usage within the apply lifter loop.
// Synchronize threads after shared memory load to prevent data hazards.
// Use at least 256 threads per block for maximizing occupancy and distribution of workload.
// Check if better partition parameters can maximize shared memory utilization and reduce bank conflicts.
