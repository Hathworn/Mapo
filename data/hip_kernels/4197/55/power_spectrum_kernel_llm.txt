```
// Calculate half_length outside of the loop to reduce redundant computation
// Early exit for thread_id >= half_length to minimize unnecessary execution
// Address global memory using blockIdx.x, reducing redundant computations with ldi and ldo
// Use reinterpret_cast to access float2 data, optimizing memory reads
// Skip unnecessary processing for thread_id == 0 inside main computation loop
// Handle special case for thread_id == 0 in a separate block, improving efficiency
