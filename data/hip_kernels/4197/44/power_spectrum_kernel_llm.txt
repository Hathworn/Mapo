```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access within the loop.
// Prefetch data to registers to minimize latency and improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider using __ldg() for reading constant data to enhance data locality.
// Unroll the loop to maximize pipeline performance and decrease control overhead.
