```
// Load matrix A and B tiles into shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Synchronize after loading tiles to ensure all threads have complete data
// Accumulate the product of tiles in a loop to improve performance
// Synchronize threads before loading the next tileset to prevent data hazards
