```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for better memory efficiency.
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls if dependencies allow to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Optimize shared memory usage to ensure alignment and maximize memory throughput.
// Explore loop unrolling in matrix multiplication within block if beneficial for performance.
// Ensure efficient register usage by minimizing temporary variable allocations.
