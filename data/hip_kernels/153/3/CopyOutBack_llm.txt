```
// Use shared memory to cache d_tetT and reduce global memory access frequency.
// Consider reorganizing d_vertMem and d_vertMemOutside to improve memory coalescing.
// Check for misaligned memory accesses and adjust index calculations for better alignment.
// Explore loop unrolling to minimize overhead of loop branching.
// Replace division and modulo operations with bitwise operations if possible.
// Optimize switch-case by predetermining offset logic outside the loop.
