// Use coalesced memory access for con array to improve memory bandwidth.
// Ensure that ActiveList and blockSizes are accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Consider loop unrolling if blocksize has a predictable pattern.
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts in s_block_conv updates.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
