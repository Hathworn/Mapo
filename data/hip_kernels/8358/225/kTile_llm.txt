```c
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions allow for full utilization of available SMs
// Use __restrict__ to aid the compiler in optimizing memory accesses
// Consider using shared memory if there are repeated accesses to the same src data
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for tgt by aligning thread indices with linear memory layout
// Reduce memory divergence by ensuring access patterns are uniform across threads
// Balance the workload across threads to maximize parallel efficiency
// Double-check to make sure no bank conflicts occur when shared memory is used
