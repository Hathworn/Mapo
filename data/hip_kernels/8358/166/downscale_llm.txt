```
// Unroll the inner loops for better performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access patterns
// Use shared memory if data reuse occurs within a block to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions for data exchange between threads within a warp
// Optimize the index calculation to minimize arithmetic instructions
// Check if data loads are memory bound and adjust for optimal bandwidth utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory usage
