// Prefetch Y, dY, and dX into shared memory for better memory coalescing
// Ensure reduction_buffer is aligned for better memory access patterns
// Use warp-level primitives for reduction to optimize synchronization overhead
// Minimize shared memory usage by storing intermediate results in registers
