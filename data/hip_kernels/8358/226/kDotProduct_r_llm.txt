```cpp
// Use loop unrolling to improve memory coalescing and reduce memory access overhead
// Optimize for memory access patterns by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations
// Exploit shared memory for parallel reduction to minimize global memory access
// Utilize warp-level synchronization to avoid unnecessary __syncthreads calls
// Ensure shared memory is declared as volatile for warp-level operations to prevent compiler optimizations
// Adopt efficient reduction patterns to reduce shared memory bank conflicts
```
