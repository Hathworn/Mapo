// Use shared memory for intermediate storage to reduce global memory access latency.
// Utilize atomic operations to safely update shared memory and prevent race conditions.
// Minimize divergence by avoiding conditional statements within data processing loop.
// Avoid repeated global memory accesses by recalculating values like `stride` and `index` upfront.
