```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses in frequent updates
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures properly
// Utilize warp-level primitives for better efficiency on shared calculations
// Avoid repeated division by computing common terms once and storing them
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize access latency during computations
// Examine if loop unrolling could benefit performance for the strides used
