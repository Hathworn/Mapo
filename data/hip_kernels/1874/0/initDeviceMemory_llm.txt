```
// Consider using coalesced memory access to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Use registers for frequently used variables to reduce memory access time.
// Optimize the use of shared memory to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to allow compiler optimizations.
// Implement loop unrolling for reducing the loop overhead.
// Explore using warp-level primitives for faster reduction operations.
