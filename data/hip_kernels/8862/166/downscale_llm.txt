// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize bank conflicts while using shared memory
// Employ loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Consider using cooperative groups for better synchronization
// Prefetch data to reduce global memory latency
// Optimize thread block size for the specific GPU architecture
// Align data structures to minimize memory access latency
