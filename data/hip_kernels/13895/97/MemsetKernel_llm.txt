// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latencies
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing to improve performance
// Experiment with different block and thread dimensions for better occupancy
// Profile kernel to identify memory bottlenecks and adjust accordingly
// Use atomic operations if necessary to safely update shared data
