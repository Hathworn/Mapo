```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring the data for threads within a warp is contiguous in memory
// Use shared memory to load blocks of normalization_factor to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize global memory access patterns for image reads and writes
// Utilize vectorized operations if applicable to process multiple values per thread
// Ensure threads accessing the same image row are within the same warp to minimize thread divergence
