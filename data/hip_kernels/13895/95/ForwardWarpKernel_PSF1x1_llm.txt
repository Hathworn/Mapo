```
// Use __ldg intrinsic for loading read-only data to optimize memory access on GPU.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing thread access patterns effectively.
// Minimize divergent branches for optimal warp execution.
// Consider data reuse in shared memory to reduce global memory access frequency.
// Align data structures appropriately to ensure optimal memory throughput.
// Explore thread block size and grid configuration for optimal hardware utilization.
