```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches by reorganizing condition checks
// Use __ldg for read-only data to leverage texture cache
// Use registers wisely to reduce register pressure
// Align data structures to improve memory access patterns
