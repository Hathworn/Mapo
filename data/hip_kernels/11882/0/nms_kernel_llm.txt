```
// Use shared memory efficiently by loading the necessary box data only
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using texture memory for read-only box data to potentially reduce memory latency
// Implement loop unrolling to minimize the loop overhead for shared memory loading
// Align dev_boxes on 128-byte boundaries to improve global memory access speed
// Utilize __syncthreads() sparingly to prevent warp divergence and maximize parallel execution
