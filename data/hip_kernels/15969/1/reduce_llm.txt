```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for d_out_shared and d_in pointers to improve compiler optimization
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring data read by consecutive threads is contiguous
// Use loop unrolling for the shared_reduce function to minimize the number of iterations and synchronize calls
// Ensure data fitting in shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Prefer using atomic operations if applicable to reduce synchronization overhead
