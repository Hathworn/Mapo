```cpp
// Ensure coalesced global memory access by aligning data structure
// Minimize redundant reads by using shared memory or registers for repetitively accessed data
// Consider avoiding bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Strive for warp divergence minimization for improved execution efficiency
// Enhance memory throughput by unrolling loops, if applicable
// Use texture memory for better cache locality if read-only data fits pattern
```
