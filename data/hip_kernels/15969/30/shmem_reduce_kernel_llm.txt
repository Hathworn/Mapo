```
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance.
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions to optimize within-warp reductions.
// Check for out-of-bounds access to avoid redundant calculations.
// Minimize synchronizations by optimizing the reduction loop.
