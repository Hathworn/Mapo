```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when loading data from global to shared memory
// Ensure shared memory is fully utilized to avoid bank conflicts
// Leverage warp-level primitives instead of explicit synchronization for efficiency
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Align data to natural boundaries for optimal memory access speed
