// Ensure coalesced access by aligning data to memory boundaries.
// Optimize shared memory bank conflicts by structuring data correctly.
// Use __syncthreads() only when necessary to minimize performance overhead.
// Prefetch data from global memory to shared memory to reduce access latency.
// Avoid redundant condition checks by restructuring loops for efficiency.
