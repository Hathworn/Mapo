```
// Consider padding memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Use shared memory to cache data for each thread block
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning data properly
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel for efficiency
