```
// Use shared memory for bins to minimize global memory accesses.
// Implement warp-level primitives to reduce contention in atomic operations.
// Use loop unrolling for accessing input data to improve memory access efficiency.
// Consider using half precision where possible to reduce memory bandwidth.
