// Consider optimizing memory access by ensuring a, b, and c are properly coalesced  
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory latency  
// Evaluate whether loop unrolling could improve performance for the addition operation  
// Consider increasing thread block size to maximize hardware utilization
