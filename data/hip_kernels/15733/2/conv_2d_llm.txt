// Use shared memory to store mask and avoid redundant global memory access.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for Mat and res to improve bandwidth.
// Ensure alignment for Mat and res on memory boundaries for optimal access speed.
// Take advantage of constant memory for the mask as it is read-only and used by all threads.
