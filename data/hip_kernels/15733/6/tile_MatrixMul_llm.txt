// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for loading A and B matrices.
// Align thread and block indices to optimize memory access patterns.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring conditional statements are uniform across threads.
// Consider using an optimized tile size that maximizes shared memory usage while minimizing bank conflicts.
