```
// Ensure BLOCK_SIZE matches blockDim.x for optimal shared memory usage
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for global memory
// Use __restrict__ to enable compiler optimizations for pointers
// Reduce redundant memory access by maximizing shared memory usage
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory
// Optimize BLOCK_SIZE to balance between shared memory usage and register pressure
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory for better performance
