```
// Use coalesced memory access for array a to optimize memory transactions.
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy.
// Prefetch data to registers for array a within the valid range before processing.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access by ensuring shared_b is accessed uniformly.
// Use warp-synchronous programming techniques to reduce the need for __syncthreads().
