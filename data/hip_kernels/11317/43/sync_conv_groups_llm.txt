```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses across threads
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory transactions
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel
// Consider using vectorized data types to enhance memory throughput
