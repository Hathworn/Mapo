// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated reads from global memory for better performance.
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring continuous memory access for threads in the same warp.
// Optimize loop unrolling further or apply warp-level primitives for reducing branch divergence.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized memory loads (e.g., float4) to reduce memory transactions.
