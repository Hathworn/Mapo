```
// Ensure memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access the same data to avoid redundant global memory accesses
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and performance
// Check if loop unrolling can improve performance in this use case
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures to maximize memory access efficiency
