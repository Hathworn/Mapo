```
// Consider using shared memory to load data from A and B to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the memory access patterns to achieve coalesced memory access.
// Evaluate the usage of texture memory for potentially faster read-only data access.
// Align data structures for better memory alignment if applicable.
// Check if N is always a multiple of blockDim.x for better CUDA utilization.
