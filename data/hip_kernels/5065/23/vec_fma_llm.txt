```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible.
// Ensure that the memory alignment of arrays A, B, C, and D is optimal.
// Use loop unrolling if the operation needs to be repeated to reduce loop overhead.
// Evaluate if using warp shuffling techniques would be beneficial for the operation.
// Check if using multiple kernels or streams could achieve better concurrency and performance.
// Implement a prefetch mechanism to hide memory latency.
