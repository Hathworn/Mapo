```
// Optimize global memory access pattern by ensuring coalesced writes to A.
// Consider using shared memory for repetitive calculations of 'a' and 'b' to reduce arithmetic overhead.
// Remove unnecessary recalculations of val inside the loop to improve performance.
// Ensure the use of float constants (e.g., 4.0f) to avoid type conversion overhead.
