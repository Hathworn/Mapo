// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a contiguous manner.
// Consider using shared memory if there is potential for data reuse to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use appropriate block size to maximize occupancy and utilize memory bandwidth effectively.
// Check for bank conflicts if using shared memory to optimize memory transactions.
