```cpp
// Consider using shared memory if accessing VN and V multiple times to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and accesses to warp boundaries.
// If possible, adjust grid and block size to optimize memory throughput and maximize occupancy.
