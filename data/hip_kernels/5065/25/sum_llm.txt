```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access by coalescing data loads.
// Ensure bank conflicts are minimized in shared memory access.
// Maximize occupancy by carefully setting block and grid sizes.
// Consider using atomic operations for final accumulation in global memory.
// Use __syncthreads to guarantee shared memory coherence.
