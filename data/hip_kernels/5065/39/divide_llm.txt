// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads
// Consider loop unrolling if computation inside the loop is significant to improve performance
// Verify memory coalescing patterns for optimal access in warp executions
// Explore asynchronous memory copies to overlap data transfer with computation if applicable
