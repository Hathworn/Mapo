```
// Use shared memory to cache data for reuse and reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data accesses to warp size.
// Optimize memory access by utilizing the __restrict__ keyword with pointers.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and ensure full utilization of hardware resources.
