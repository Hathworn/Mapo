```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate using __syncthreads() to sync threads if shared memory is utilized.
// Explore registering variables that are repeatedly used to optimize register usage.
// Investigate launching with optimal block size to fully utilize the GPU resources.
