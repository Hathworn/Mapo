```
// Use shared memory or registers to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory
// Coalesce memory accesses for better performance
// Consider using texture memory for reading input data efficiently
// Unroll loops to reduce loop overhead
// Optimize mathematical operations by using FMA (Fused Multiply-Add)
