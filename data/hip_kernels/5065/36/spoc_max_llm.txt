```
// Reduce the number of global memory accesses by using shared memory
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having each thread in a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper data alignment
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to synchronize threads after shared memory loading and reduction steps
// Optimize block size and grid size to achieve maximum occupancy and minimize latency
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync for better reduction within warps
