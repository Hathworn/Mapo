```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to store A[idx] data temporarily for better access speed
// Ensure data alignment for the struct point2 for optimal memory coalescing
// Use float instead of double if precision allows, to reduce memory footprint and improve performance
// Consider loop unrolling by a factor of unrollFactor to increase ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Explore using vectorized operations if the hardware supports it to improve throughput
// Investigate if using texture memory provides better caching for read-only data like A[idx]
