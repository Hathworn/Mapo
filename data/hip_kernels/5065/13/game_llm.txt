```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesced memory accesses could improve performance by aligning data access patterns.
// Precompute values that are used multiple times to reduce redundant calculations.
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied to further optimize the performance.
// Evaluate if using texture memory could provide benefits for read-only data.
