```
// Consider using shared memory for data reused by multiple threads to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced access patterns for the arrays A, B, C, and D to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use appropriate block and grid dimensions based on the target hardware to maximize resource utilization.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring conditional statements are minimized or optimized.
