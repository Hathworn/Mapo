// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput.
// Analyze memory bank conflicts in shared memory and optimize accordingly.
// Ensure the size of shared memory arrays is chosen based on occupancy and resource constraints.
// Optimize the kernel launch parameters to maximize occupancy and match the problem size.
// Utilize __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
