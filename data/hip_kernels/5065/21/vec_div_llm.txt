```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
// Ensure memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Explore vectorized loads and stores to reduce memory transactions.
// Use a loop unrolling technique if `N` is known to be large and divisible by a factor.
// Minimize divergent branches in thread execution paths.
