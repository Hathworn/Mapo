```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers A, B, and C to enable compiler optimizations
// Consider using shared memory for small tiles of A, B, and C to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access by verifying proper alignment of A, B, and C
// Experiment with different block sizes to balance between occupancy and memory throughput
// Unroll the loop to reduce loop control overhead and improve performance
// Use efficient memory access patterns to optimize memory bandwidth utilization
