```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access and increase access speed
// Ensure memory coalescing by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Align shared memory access to warp size for optimal performance
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after each step of reduction
// Consider adjusting thread block size for efficient shared memory usage and occupancy
// Use atomicAdd only for final accumulation to minimize contention
