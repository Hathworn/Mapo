```
// Use shared memory to store input data for improved memory access speed
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by organizing threads to avoid conflicts
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to replace some __syncthreads() calls
// Reorganize data access to ensure coalesced memory transactions
// Avoid frequent global memory accesses by caching repetitive data in registers
