```
// Consider coalesced memory access to global memory
// Optimize shared memory usage to reduce bank conflicts
// Increase block size for better occupancy and efficiency
// Use asynchronous copy for data transfer to shared memory if supported
// Utilize constant memory for any static data that all threads use
