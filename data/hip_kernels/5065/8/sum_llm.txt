```
// Ensure vec1 is accessed in a coalesced manner.
// Load elements into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Use shared memory to store tmp1; optimize its indexing to maximize usage.
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls within parallel reduction.
// Use atomic operations sparingly to minimize their performance impact on result.
