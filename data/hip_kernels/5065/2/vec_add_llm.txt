```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Employ coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to enable optimized data transfer.
// Implement memory prefetching techniques if possible to reduce latency.
