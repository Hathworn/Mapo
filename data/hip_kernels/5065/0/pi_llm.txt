// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Precompute values used in conditional checks to cut down repeated calculations
// Unroll loops to increase throughput and maximize the use of processor resources
// Improve branch prediction by simplifying conditions and minimizing divergences
