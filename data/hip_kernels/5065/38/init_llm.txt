// Utilize shared memory to cache values of "V" for better memory access efficiency.  
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when accessing "A" to reduce global memory latency.  
// Minimize repeated computations of "index" by storing its value in a register.  
// Tune block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and achieve optimal performance.
