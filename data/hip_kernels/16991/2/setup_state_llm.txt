```cpp
// Use thread ID for states instead of single state initialization
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning data structures optimally
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for best performance
// Consider shared memory usage if the memory footprint allows
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring adjacent threads access contiguous memory
```
