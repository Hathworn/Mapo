```
// Load fixed values like batch_index and class_index into registers before kernel loops to reduce memory access.
// Minimize global memory access by using shared memory to store frequently accessed data.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize the block size to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient resource usage.
