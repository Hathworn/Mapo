// Consider using shared memory to cache col_sum for faster access
// Ensure output accesses are coalesced for better memory throughput
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can reduce loop overhead
// Consider adjusting block and grid sizes for optimal occupancy
// Ensure there are no bank conflicts in accessing shared memory
