```cpp
// Consider using cooperative groups for better synchronization
// Optimize memory access by ensuring state array is in coalesced order
// Use shared memory if accessing state multiple times within the kernel
// Minimize divergence by ensuring even workload distribution across threads
// Use loop unrolling if this setup is a bottleneck and loops are present
```
