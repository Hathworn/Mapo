```
// Use coalesced memory access for better performance
// Ensure the kernel launch parameters are optimized for your specific hardware
// Minimize the number of shared memory accesses
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Adjust loop unrolling to balance between register pressure and performance gain
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to leverage caching
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned
