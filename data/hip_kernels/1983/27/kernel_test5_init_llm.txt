```
// Align memory accesses to increase throughput
// Unroll loops to reduce the overhead of branch instructions
// Use 32-bit accesses instead of 8-bit to improve memory coalescing
// Ensure the thread block size is a multiple of the warp size for optimal performance
// Prefetch data when possible to hide memory latency
```
