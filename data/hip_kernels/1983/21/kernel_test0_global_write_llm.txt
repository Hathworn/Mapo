```
// Consider coalesced memory access for better utilization of global memory bandwidth.
// Check for alignment of the initial pointer to optimize memory access.
// Avoid branching inside the loop for a more efficient execution path.
// Ensure memory access patterns do not cause bank conflicts and optimize access strides.
