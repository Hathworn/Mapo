```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel function.
// Ensure enough work is assigned to each thread block for better occupancy.
// Consider using asynchronous memory copies to overlap data transfer with computation.
