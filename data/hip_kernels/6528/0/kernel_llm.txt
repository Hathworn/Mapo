```cpp
// Consider optimizing data access patterns to improve coalesced memory access if applicable.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of loop unrolling for the workload inside the kernel.
// Investigate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if multiple threads require the same data.
// Check for opportunities to reduce warp divergence by reordering conditional statements.
// Profile memory access patterns to ensure alignment and reduce potential bank conflicts.
