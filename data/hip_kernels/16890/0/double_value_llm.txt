```c
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for y[idx]
// Ensure x and y are aligned in memory for optimal access
// Avoiding bank conflicts in shared memory access, if utilized
// Employ __restrict__ pointers if aliasing can be ruled out
// Use constant memory for any constant data access within the kernel
```
