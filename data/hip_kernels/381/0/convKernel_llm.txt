```c
// Consider using texture memory for 'source' and 'kernel' for faster read access
// Implement loop unrolling only if you are certain 'len' is a multiple of 4
// Ensure 'len' is a constant expression or manage boundary conditions properly
// Investigate memory coalescing by ensuring 'source' and 'kernel' alignment
// Assess shared memory usage if the working set fits into it for reduced latency
// Profile to check if bank conflicts occur in shared memory usage
