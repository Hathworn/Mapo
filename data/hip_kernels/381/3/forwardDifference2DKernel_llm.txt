// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for data array.
// Consider memory coalescing to improve access patterns of dx and dy arrays.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and load balancing.
// Use loop unrolling to enhance computation efficiency if logical operations permit.
