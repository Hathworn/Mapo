```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for dx and dy to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use loop unrolling to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead
// Ensure that stride calculations prevent memory bank conflicts
// Consider employing warp-level primitives for synchronization and data sharing
