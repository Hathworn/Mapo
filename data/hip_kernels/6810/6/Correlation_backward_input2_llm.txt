// Reuse common index calculations to reduce redundant operations
// Use shared memory to accumulate results and minimize global memory writes
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory latency
// Combine nested loops into a single loop to improve warp execution efficiency
// Reduce number of global memory access by using shared memory for reduction
// Avoid branching with max/min functions to help with warp execution efficiency
