```
// Coalesce global memory accesses by organizing rInput1 and rInput2 accesses
// Use shared memory to minimize repetitive global memory access within loops
// Utilize memory coalescing for output writes by arranging blockIdx to access consecutive elements
// Balance computation and memory access within threads to optimize performance
// Reduce register pressure by optimizing thread usage within the prod_sum calculation
// Ensure aligned memory access for global reads and writes to improve efficiency
