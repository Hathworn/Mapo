```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache commonly accessed data for faster access
// Optimize the loop bounds with better branch prediction by arranging the if-statements differently
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures to 128 bytes where possible
// Implement loop unrolling for inner loops to improve instruction throughput
// Consider using asynchronous memory copies with streams to overlap data transfer and computation
// Use warp shuffling for reduction instead of shared memory to minimize shared memory usage
