// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing global memory reads for the `input` array.  
// Minimize bank conflicts when writing to `rinput` by ensuring alignment and proper thread-to-data mapping.  
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access during the `input` read phase.  
// Consider increasing the block size (blockDim.x) for better parallelism, while ensuring no warp divergence.  
// Add loop unrolling to maximize instruction throughput and minimize loop overhead.  
// Use `__restrict__` keyword for `input` and `rinput` pointers to aid compiler optimization.  
// Prefetch data into registers when repeatedly accessing the same elements in the loop.
