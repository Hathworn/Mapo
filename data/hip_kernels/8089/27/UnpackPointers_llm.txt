```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory when loading data into shared memory
// Employ coalesced writes to global memory for ptrs array
// Minimize shared memory accesses by reducing redundant reads
// Adjust grid and block configurations to maximize occupancy and efficiently hide latency
