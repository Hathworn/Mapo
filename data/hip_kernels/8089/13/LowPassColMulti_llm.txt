```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently used data.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access patterns to enhance memory throughput.
// Consider loading data into registers to minimize shared memory bank conflicts.
// Apply loop unrolling in the computation section to improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Employ __syncthreads() appropriately to prevent race conditions when accessing shared memory.
// Align data in shared memory to reduce latency from misaligned memory access.
// Explore using constant memory for frequently accessed relatively small data like kernel coefficients.
// Adjust block and grid sizes to improve occupancy while balancing memory bandwidth usage.
