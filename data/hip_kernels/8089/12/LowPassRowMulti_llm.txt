```
// Ensure coalesced global memory accesses to d_Data by aligning load operations.
// Consider further unrolling the loop for computations to reduce register pressure.
// Optimize shared memory usage by balancing shared memory size and block occupancy.
// Ensure bank conflict free accesses in shared memory by properly aligning shared memory loads.
// Consider using read-only data cache (__ldg()) for d_Kernel to optimize data fetch.
