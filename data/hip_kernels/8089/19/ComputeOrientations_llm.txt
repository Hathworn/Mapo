```cpp
// Optimize memory coalescence for accessing g_Data.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve performance.
// Perform memory access boundary checks efficiently.
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts.
// Utilize more threads per block for better GPU utilization.
// Optimize shared memory usage by limiting array sizes.
// Minimize __syncthreads() calls where possible.
// Balance the workload among threads to avoid divergence.
