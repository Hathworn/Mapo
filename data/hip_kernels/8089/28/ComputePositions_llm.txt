```
// Cache repeated memory accesses by storing g_Data2[p].
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce data access for g_Data arrays to improve memory access pattern.
// Reduce divergence by avoiding unnecessary calculations for out-of-bound indices.
// Preload all data used in computations into registers if possible.
// Consider unrolling loops if there are any for better instruction throughput.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow similar paths.
// Introduce const memory for frequently read constants if applicable.
// Utilize vectorized memory operations to move multiple data at once when possible.
// Consider split load and compute phases with __syncthreads if shared memory is used.
