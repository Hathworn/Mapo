```
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for g_Data to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Pre-calculate common expressions outside critical loops for memory access reduction.
// Consider padding shared memory arrays to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize conditional branching by evaluating constraints before accessing data.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by grouping operations where possible.
// Utilize warp shuffle functions for histogram reduction if supported by the target architecture.
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by balancing the number of threads and occupancy per SM.
// Evaluate register pressure and consider using local memory for temporaries if beneficial.
