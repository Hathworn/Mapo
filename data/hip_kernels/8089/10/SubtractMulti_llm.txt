```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when threads access the same data.
// Optimize the memory access by coalescing reads and writes where possible.
// Ensure that global memory accesses are aligned to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
// Reduce register usage per thread to allow for higher occupancy.
