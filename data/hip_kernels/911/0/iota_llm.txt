```c
// Check to ensure coalesced memory access for optimal performance
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are chosen to fully utilize GPU hardware
// Minimize branching within the loop to improve warp execution efficiency
