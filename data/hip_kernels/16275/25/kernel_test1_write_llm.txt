```
// Use coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth
// Align memory accesses to cache line size for better performance
// Minimize divergent branches for efficiency
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure all memory accesses are within bounds to avoid errors
