```c
// Ensure the thread index calculation accounts for the data type size.
// Guarantee the end_ptr check prevents out-of-bounds access.
// Address its alignment to avoid data race issues.
// Utilize loop unrolling for reduced loop overhead.
// Enhance memory coalescing by writing consecutive memory addresses.
// Optimize pattern computation by minimizing bitwise operations inside the loop.
