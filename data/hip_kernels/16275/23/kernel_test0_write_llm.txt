```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Avoid branch divergence to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Optimize access patterns to leverage cache use by minimizing random memory access.
// Implement loop unrolling to improve instruction throughput and hide memory latency.
// Consider use of shared memory for data reused within a block to reduce global memory traffic.
