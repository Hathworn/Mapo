```
// Consider using shared memory more effectively to minimize redundant global memory accesses
// Evaluate if preloading xyz1 data into shared memory can help reduce memory traffic
// Investigate the potential for thread-level parallel reduction in calculating 'd' to improve performance
// Check if there's an opportunity to leverage texture memory for xyz1 and xyz2 for faster reads
// Make sure memory coalescing is achieved when reading from and writing to global memory
