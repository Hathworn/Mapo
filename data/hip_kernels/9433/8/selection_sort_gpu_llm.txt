```
// Use shared memory to reduce access time for frequently accessed data
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits for better performance
// Consider using coalesced access patterns for global memory operations
// Optimize stride for better warp utilization when accessing shared memory
// Balance shared and global memory usage depending on data size
// Evaluate shared memory layout for potential bank conflicts
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning control structures
