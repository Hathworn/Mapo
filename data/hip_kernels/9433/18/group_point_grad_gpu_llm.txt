// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data layout to prevent unaligned access.
// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of grad_out to reduce global memory reads.
// Optimize memory usage by minimizing redundant calculations in index-based arithmetic.
// Use atomic operations carefully to avoid serialization in parallel computations.
