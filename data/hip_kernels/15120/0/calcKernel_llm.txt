// Consider coalescing memory access to d_in and d_out to improve memory throughput.  
// Avoid branch divergence in the 'if' statement by processing threads outside range differently.  
// Use shared memory if there are redundant calculations for gid within blocks to reduce global memory access.  
// Optimize pow function by approximating it with faster math operations if precision allows.  
// Ensure NUM_THREADS aligns with block size for optimal thread occupancy.  
// Prefetch input data to L2 cache if possible, depending on usage patterns outside kernel.
