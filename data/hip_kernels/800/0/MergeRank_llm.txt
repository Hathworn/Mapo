// Consider increasing the size of shared memory dynamically based on block size
// Ensure memory alignment when loading data into shared memory
// Use coalesced memory accesses when reading from and writing to global memory
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts during parallel binary search
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
