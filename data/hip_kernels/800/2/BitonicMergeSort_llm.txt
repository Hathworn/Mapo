// Ensure coalesced global memory access when reading from d_input
// Minimize memory bank conflicts in shared_data accesses
// Use __shfl_xor() or warp-level primitives for optimization in conditional swaps
// Reduce the use of __syncthreads() where possible by restructuring loops
// Try optimizing log2f calculations by precomputing values outside the kernel
// Avoid redundant calculations within loops, such as threads_in_box computation
// Leverage memory alignment for better shared memory utilization
// Explore using a warp shuffle-based approach for the bitonic sort logic
