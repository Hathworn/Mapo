```
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing for PolyValue reads.
// Evaluate the impact of using shared memory to cache frequently accessed PolyValue data.
// Consider using __ldg() for reading PolyValue if it is read-only and resides in GPU's global memory.
// Ensure aligned memory access for OCTData to improve memory throughput.
