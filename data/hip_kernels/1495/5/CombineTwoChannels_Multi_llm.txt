// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Ensure that BoxSize and BoxIndex calculations minimize divergent branching
// Minimize unnecessary read/write operations within the kernel
// Consider optimizing the memory layout to enhance read efficiency
// Evaluate the use of shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Reduce reliance on printf debugging for performance critical sections
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to enhance occupancy
