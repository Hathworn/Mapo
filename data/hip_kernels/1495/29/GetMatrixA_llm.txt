// Consider using shared memory to cache OCTData if accessed multiple times
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead in computation
// Pre-compute reciprocal of OneDataSize to replace division with multiplication
// Utilize warp-level primitives to reduce latency of exponential calculations
// Consider employing FMAD (Fused Multiply-Add) to improve precision and performance
// Investigate if MatrixA[id] can take advantage of coalesced memory access patterns
