```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for OCTData_2Channls using contiguous threads
// Minimize divergent branches with careful arrangement of boundary checks
// Leverage shared memory if bandwidth allows to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling if accessing multiple elements sequentially
