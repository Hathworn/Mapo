```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data elements
// Minimize the use of pow() function within loops for better performance
// Precompute and store powers of normalized index outside of time-critical loops
// Loop unrolling might benefit performance by reducing loop overhead
// Avoid division by reusing inverse of OneDataSize if possible
