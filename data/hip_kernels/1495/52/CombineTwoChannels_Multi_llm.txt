```
// Optimize the calculation of global thread ID by minimizing arithmetic operations
// Check memory alignment to reduce misaligned accesses
// Implement shared memory to load data cooperatively within a block
// Use loop unrolling for fixed-size operations to enhance throughput
// Consider using warp shuffle for intra-warp data sharing to reduce global memory access
