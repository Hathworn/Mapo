```
// Use memory coalescing for optimal memory access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches to improve execution efficiency
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Preload repeated values into shared memory for faster access
// Optimize index calculations to reduce instruction count
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing intermediate results
// Align data structures to natural boundaries to prevent misalignment penalties
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
