```c
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes to KSpaceData.
// Consider using shared memory for frequent data access in the calculation of m and c.
// Avoid redundant calculations by precomputing PXScale differences outside the global function.
// Unroll the loop where idZ is calculated to enhance performance.
