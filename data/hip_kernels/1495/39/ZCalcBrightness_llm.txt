```
// Ensure data coherence by preferring shared memory for commonly accessed data
// Implement load coalescing to optimize data transfer between global memory and compute units
// Explore loop unrolling to reduce the computational latency inside loops
// Consider using asynchronous memory prefetching for data that will be accessed soon
