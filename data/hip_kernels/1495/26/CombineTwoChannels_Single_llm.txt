```
// Use continuous memory access patterns to improve memory coalescing
// Align data structures to avoid unaligned memory access penalties
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate calculations to reduce global memory accesses
// Reorder calculations to minimize divergent branches among threads
// Utilize thread block dimensions to enhance occupancy and balance workloads
