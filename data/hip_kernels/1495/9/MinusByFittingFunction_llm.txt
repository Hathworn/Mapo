```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses by checking if OCTData and PolyValue are stored in a way that enhances contiguous memory access patterns.
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed values like PolyValue[idZ] if multiple threads access the same index.
// Ensure data alignment for PolyValue to benefit from better memory access patterns on GPUs.
// Use loop unrolling techniques if applicable for any repetitive calculations within the kernel for efficiency.
// Ensure the kernel grid size is optimized to fully utilize the available GPU cores and achieve high occupancy.
