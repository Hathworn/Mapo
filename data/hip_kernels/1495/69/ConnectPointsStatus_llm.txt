```
// Consider coalesced memory access for PointType_BestN to improve memory throughput.
// Decompose complex expressions used in indexing for better readability and potential compiler optimization.
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Store repeated calculations such as sizeIndex * rows * ChooseBestN in temporary variables to reduce arithmetic instructions.
// Prefetch nextPoint into a register before entering the inner loop to reduce repetitive memory accesses.
// Utilize shared memory to store frequently accessed data like PointType_BestN to reduce global memory transactions.
