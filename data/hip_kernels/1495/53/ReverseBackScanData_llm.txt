```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance.
// Investigate removing or minimizing atomic operations if not necessary.
// Analyze block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and load balancing.
// Ensure memory alignment to prevent uncoalesced accesses.
