```
// Ensure maximum occupancy by choosing optimal block size
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Unroll loops to enhance throughput and reduce loop overhead
// Align data accesses for improved memory coalescence
// Balance workload among threads to prevent divergence
// Prefetch data to shared memory to reduce latency
// Consider vectorized loads to further utilize memory bandwidth
