```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data frequently accessed by threads within the same block
// Align memory access patterns to optimize cache performance and reduce memory latency
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data access sequentially within a warp
// Reduce divergence by minimizing conditional statements where possible
