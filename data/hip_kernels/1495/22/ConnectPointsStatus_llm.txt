```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access, especially for PointType_BestN.
// Improve coalescing by aligning memory accesses for PointType_BestN and ConnectStatus with warp sizes.
// Use loop unrolling to enhance performance within the nested loops.
// Minimize branching within loops to boost execution speed.
// Avoid global memory writes if not absolutely necessary within loops to reduce latency.
