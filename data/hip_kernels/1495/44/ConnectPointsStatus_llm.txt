```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads in a block follow the same execution path
// Try loop unrolling to enhance performance inside the nested loop
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structure for PointType_BestN
// Employ prefetching to hide memory latency for PointType_BestN and ConnectStatus
// Consider merging reads/writes to global memory to minimize transaction overhead
```
