// Consider using shared memory for repeated values like MaxValue and MinValue to minimize global memory access.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling or warp-level primitives could further enhance performance for predictable data patterns.
// Ensure memory alignment of ShiftData array to reduce potential coalescing issues during access.
// Monitor for bank conflicts when using shared memory if implemented, to maintain speed improvements.
