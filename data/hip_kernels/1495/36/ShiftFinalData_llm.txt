```c
// Consider coalescing memory access for AfterFFTData to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if possible.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to maximize memory bandwidth.
// Avoid divergent branches to maintain warp efficiency.
// Evaluate the potential use of vectorized memory instructions for further optimization.
