```
// Consider using shared memory for elements if further computation requires them
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for improved throughput
// Check if using texture or constant memory could be beneficial for read-only data
// Evaluate impact of memory alignment on performance and adjust accordingly
// Review if prefetching data can help in hiding memory latency
