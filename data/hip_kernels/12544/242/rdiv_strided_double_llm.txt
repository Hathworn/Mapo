```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning the data
// Optimize memory access patterns for both `dx` and `dy`
// Ensure that `incx` and `incy` allow vectorized instructions
// Preload data into shared memory if beneficial
// Reduce redundant global memory accesses by storing `dx[i]` and `dy[i]` in registers if reused
// Consider using __ldg() to load data from global memory that doesn't change
```
