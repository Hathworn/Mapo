```
// Coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory for repetitive data access
// Optimize load/store operations to alleviate memory bottlenecks
// Align data accesses with memory boundaries for performance gain
// Minimize divergent branching within the kernel function
// Adjust the grid and block size for better occupancy
