// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure shared memory loads occur before computation to optimize synchronization.
// Implement coalesced memory access patterns when loading data into shared memory.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce divergence during sign calculation.
