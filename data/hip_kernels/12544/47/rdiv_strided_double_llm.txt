```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for dx and dy
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize thread utilization by ensuring full warp occupancy
// Explore using vectorized loads and stores if applicable
// Ensure alignment of data structures to prevent unaligned memory access
// Review the use of int for indexing, consider size_t for larger arrays
