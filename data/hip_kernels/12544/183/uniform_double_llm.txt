```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in the 'result' array.
// Implement shared memory usage to temporarily store 'result' data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure result array is properly aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
// Implement loop unrolling to increase throughput by reducing loop control overhead.
