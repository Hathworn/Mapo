// Consider using shared memory for `dx` and `dy` to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures and accessing consecutive elements.
// Explore loop unrolling further for better instruction-level parallelism.
// Investigate if using warp-level primitives could enhance synchronization and reduce divergence.
