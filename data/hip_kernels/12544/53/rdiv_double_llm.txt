// Consider coalescing memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements in memory.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth by loading data into shared memory before processing it.
// Optimize for memory alignment to maximize throughput on memory accesses.
// Ensure occupancy is optimized by configuring block and grid sizes based on device properties.
