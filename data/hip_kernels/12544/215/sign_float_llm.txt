```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve global memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure dy and result are aligned to avoid misaligned memory accesses.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers on dy and result pointers for better compiler optimization.
// Investigate if prefetching data into shared memory can provide performance benefits.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size and grid size for optimal performance.
// Evaluate the possibility of using half precision if applicable to reduce memory bandwidth usage.
