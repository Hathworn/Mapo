// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for dy array.
// Use coalesced memory access to improve the bandwidth utilization.
// Check if aligning memory access patterns further can enhance performance.
// Evaluate if replacing division operations with multiplication for stride calculation could be beneficial.
