```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring continuous memory access patterns.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring conditions in the loop are as uniform as possible.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if multiple accesses are required for the same data.
// Consider optimizing stride and grid configuration for better performance.
