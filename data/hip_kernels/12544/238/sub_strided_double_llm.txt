```
// Use shared memory to store data from global memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize conditional statements within the loop to enhance performance.
// Ensure the loop utilizes vectorized operations for double types when possible.
