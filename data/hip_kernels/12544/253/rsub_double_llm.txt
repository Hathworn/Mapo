```
// Consider using shared memory for caching if data reuse is feasible.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking alignment of 'a', 'b', and 'sum'.
// Use texture memory if access patterns show spatial locality.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on hardware characteristics.
// Evaluate loop unrolling for the stride loop to enhance performance.
