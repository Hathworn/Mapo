```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using consecutive threads to access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need access to dy[i] before computation to reduce global memory access
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to fully utilize GPU resources, focusing on maximizing occupancy and minimizing warp divergence
