```
// Consider using shared memory to cache dx and dy elements as they are reused.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning accesses of dx, dy, and result with warp boundaries.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Avoid branch divergence by restructuring conditional statements where possible.
