```
// Use shared memory to cache `dx` and `dy` values and reduce global memory access
// Optimize the memory access pattern to be coalesced
// Consider using loop unrolling factor to balance between register pressure and performance
// Use warp-level synchronization if necessary to optimize performance
```
