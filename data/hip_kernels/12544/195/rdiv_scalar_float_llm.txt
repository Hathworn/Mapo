```
// Consider aligning data to improve memory coalescing
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to allow better compiler optimizations
// Evaluate if shared memory can be utilized to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize the division operation if possible, as it's computationally expensive
// Check for bank conflicts in memory accesses within each thread block
