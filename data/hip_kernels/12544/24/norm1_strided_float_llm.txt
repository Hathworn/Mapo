```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align memory access patterns for coalesced reads from global memory
// Ensure all accesses within the loop are coalesced for efficiency
// Minimize unnecessary synchronization by optimizing block steps
// Optimize reduction using warp unrolling for faster execution
// Use atomic operations efficiently to update the global result
