// Consider optimizing memory access patterns to improve coalesced memory access
// Ensure threads access continuous memory locations to minimize access latency
// Utilize shared memory if possible to further improve memory access efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and increase throughput
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory and optimize alignment accordingly
