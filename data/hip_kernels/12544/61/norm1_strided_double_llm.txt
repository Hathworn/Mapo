// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory only once with a single thread
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have updated shared memory before proceeding
// Utilize local register for each thread's computation to minimize memory latency
// Perform atomic addition to avoid race conditions when updating shared memory
// Perform atomic addition from shared to global memory only once by a single thread
