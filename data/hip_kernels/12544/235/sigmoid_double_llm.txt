// Consider using constant memory for any read-only data to reduce global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring result[i] accesses are contiguous.
// Check if __restrict__ qualifiers can be used to optimize pointer accesses.
// Evaluate if shared memory can be utilized to cache intermediate results.
// Verify if loop unrolling would benefit performance by reducing overhead.
