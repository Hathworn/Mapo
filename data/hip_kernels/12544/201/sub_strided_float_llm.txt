```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements
// Minimize thread divergence by reordering condition checks
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce unnecessary global memory reads
// Align data structures to ensure better memory access patterns
