```
// Consider coalesced memory access for the dy array to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure aligned memory accesses for the result array to avoid misaligned memory penalties.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access and improve performance.
// Balance thread workload to optimize for the compute capability of the GPU used.
