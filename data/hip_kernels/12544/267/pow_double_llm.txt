```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to leverage faster memory access for intermediate results
// Prefer to use a single kernel launch with optimal block and grid dimensions to maximize GPU utilization
// Consider storing temporary calculations in registers for faster access
// Reduce thread divergence by minimizing conditional statements within the kernel
