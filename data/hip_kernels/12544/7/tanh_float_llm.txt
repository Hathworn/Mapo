```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Assess if memory bank conflicts occur with current access pattern
// Explore warp-level programming to optimize thread collaboration
// Profile memory throughput to identify potential bottlenecks
