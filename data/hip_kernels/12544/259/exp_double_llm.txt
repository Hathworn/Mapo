```
// Consider using shared memory for dy elements accessed repeatedly within a block
// Optimize memory accesses by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Use a pragma directive to unroll loops if applicable and beneficial
// Evaluate using shuffle operations for intra-warp communication instead of global memory writes where possible
// Consider tiling computation to better leverage L1 cache for dy and result arrays
