```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Consider using multiple blocks for reduction to minimize idle threads
// Use warp shuffle reduction to avoid shared memory and sync overhead
// Consider using a different reduction strategy to minimize divergence
// Optimize shared memory usage to ensure full occupancy
// Validate correct memory alignment for global and shared memory accesses
