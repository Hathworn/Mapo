```
// Use shared memory to cache input data dy if there are frequent accesses
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for dy and result arrays
// Consider using vectorized reads and writes for dy and result, like float2 or float4
// Check and align memory accesses to optimize the use of memory bandwidth
// Minimize branching within the loop to improve warp execution efficiency
