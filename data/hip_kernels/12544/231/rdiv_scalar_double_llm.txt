// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster memory access.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to minimize global memory load latency.
// Ensure alignment of global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to reduce latency.
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency.
