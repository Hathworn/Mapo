```
// Coalesce memory access by ensuring dy[i] and result[i] are accessed sequentially
// Reduce divergence by minimizing the conditional checks within the loop
// Optimize thread utilization by ensuring stride-based access patterns
// Consider using shared memory if dy is reused across threads
// Adjust block and grid size to ensure optimal occupancy and memory bandwidth
