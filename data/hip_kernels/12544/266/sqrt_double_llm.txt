```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce memory latency
// Check for coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate warp divergence and minimize conditional branches within the loop
// Ensure the loop is optimized for high occupancy on the GPU
