```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for dy to improve memory bandwidth
// Prefetch data from dy to shared memory if possible
// Use __ldg() for reading from global memory if memory is read-only
// Ensure alignment of dy and result for potential vectorized reads/writes
// Optimize dx usage by making it a constant or shared variable if applicable
```
