```
// Consider accessing memory in a coalesced manner to improve performance
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Use shared memory to temporarily store data and reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop to maintain optimal warp execution efficiency
