// Consider using shared memory if frequent access to elements in a[i] or b[i] is needed
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Check if using warp-level primitives could provide better efficiency 
// Evaluate the usage of atomic operations if sum[i] requires reduction operations
