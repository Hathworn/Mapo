```
// Optimize memory access pattern by ensuring coalesced reads and writes
// Ensure global memory access is coalesced to improve performance
// Avoid thread divergence by simplifying or restructuring the conditional logic
// Use shared memory to cache data if reused within the block to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using half precision if acceptable to save bandwidth and improve performance
// Minimize the use of global memory and prefer registers for variables as feasible
