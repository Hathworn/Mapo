// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory accesses where possible  
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like 'b[i]'  
// Minimize warp divergence by reworking the conditional logic if applicable  
// Utilize float operations carefully to avoid precision issues if 'sum[i]' accumulates results frequently
