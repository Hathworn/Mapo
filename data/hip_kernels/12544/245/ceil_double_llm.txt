```
// Improve memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access to global memory
// Use shared memory if possible for repeated data access within the block
// Align data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Ensure that the number of threads in a block is a multiple of the warp size
// Use __syncthreads() where necessary to synchronize shared memory operations
