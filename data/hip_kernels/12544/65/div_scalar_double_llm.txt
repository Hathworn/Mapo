```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by checking memory alignment
// Consider loading elements into shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use __ldg to take advantage of read-only data cache for dy if the data is not being modified
// Experiment with different block sizes for better occupancy and performance
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing threads to meet conditions more uniformly
// Align data in memory to improve cache efficiency and reduce latency
