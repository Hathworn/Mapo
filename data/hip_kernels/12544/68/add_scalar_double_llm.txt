// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data within a block
// Utilize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Minimize branching in conditions to improve warp execution efficiency
// Optimize grid-stride loop by considering possible unrolling for better performance
