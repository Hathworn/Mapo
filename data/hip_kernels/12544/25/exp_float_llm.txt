// Use grid-stride loop to maximize GPU occupancy and efficiency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing dy and result in a sequential manner
// Consider using shared memory if temporary storage is needed to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefer using const keyword for fixed values (e.g. incy) for potential compiler optimizations
