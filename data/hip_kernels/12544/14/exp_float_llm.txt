```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing threads to access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access.
// Optimize loop unrolling factors to match the hardware's maximum capacity to improve throughput.
// Adjust the block size and grid size to achieve better occupancy and maximize resource utilization.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers if no aliasing occurs to improve memory access patterns.
