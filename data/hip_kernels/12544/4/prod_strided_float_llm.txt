// Use shared memory to reduce memory access latencies  
// Avoid atomic operations when possible to optimize memory contention  
// Prefetch data into local variables to reduce repeated global memory access  
// Reduce divergence by minimizing conditional statements inside loops  
// Optimize block and thread configurations for better memory coalescing  
// Consider loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead  
// Align data access to maximize memory coalescing effectiveness  
// Evaluate warp-level synchronization for granular control instead of block-level  
// Promote variable usage to registers for higher local cache efficiency
