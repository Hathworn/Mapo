```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Preload data from global memory to shared memory.
// Balance the workloads efficiently among threads.
// Coalesce global memory accesses for better bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure proper alignment for global memory accesses.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reducing divergence.
// Minimize the use of if statements inside the loop for faster execution.
// Consider launching more threads to maximize GPU utilization.
