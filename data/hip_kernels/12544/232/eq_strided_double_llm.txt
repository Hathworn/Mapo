```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data for coalesced memory access
// Ensure all global memory accesses are aligned to improve throughput
// Minimize divergent branches to reduce warp execution time
// Optimize loop unrolling to improve pipeline utilization
// Assess the use of atomic operations for potential performance gains if needed
// Reduce register usage per thread to allow more concurrent active threads
