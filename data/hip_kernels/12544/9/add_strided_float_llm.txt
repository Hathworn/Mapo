// Ensure dx and dy arrays are accessed in a coalesced manner
// Avoid branching by using conditional expressions or predication
// Use shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses if applicable
// Align memory allocations to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target hardware
