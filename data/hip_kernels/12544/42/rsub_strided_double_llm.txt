```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations when possible
// Use shared memory to prefetch data if there are access patterns that can benefit from it
// Minimize divergence in control flow by ensuring all threads in a warp tend to follow the same execution path
// Consider using vectorized memory access if applicable for your specific data structure and hardware
