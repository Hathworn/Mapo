```cpp
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to potentially improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory coalescing
// Increase block size while balancing occupancy for better performance
// Consider shared memory for temporary data storage if needed
// Pre-fetch data into registers to reduce global memory latency
```
