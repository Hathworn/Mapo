```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for dy and result to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Ensure dy and result are aligned to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to find the optimal configuration for the specific GPU architecture.
// Explore using shared memory if there are opportunities to reduce global memory access latency.
