// Use shared memory to cache portions of dx and dy to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive data elements.
// Align data structures to memory boundaries to enable vectorized loads and stores.
// Consider pre-fetching data into registers to hide memory latency.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and memory throughput.
