```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like dx and dy for faster reads
// Assess if dx[i] and dy[i] are coherent and use texture memory for better read performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access to dx and dy arrays to optimize memory bandwidth
// Evaluate loop unrolling technique for the computation loop to reduce control overhead
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to match the GPU's architecture and workload characteristics
