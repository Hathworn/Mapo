```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access per thread
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data accesses
// Consider using vectorized memory operations for improved bandwidth utilization
// Optimize block size to maximize occupancy while ensuring sufficient parallelism
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads if shared memory is used
// Profile to identify and minimize potential bank conflicts in shared memory usage
