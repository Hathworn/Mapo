```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive elements.
// Use shared memory to further reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory alignment for double elements to optimize memory transactions.
// Reduce bank conflicts and achieve higher memory throughput by structuring access patterns.
