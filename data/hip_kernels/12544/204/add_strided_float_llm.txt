```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data and using contiguous memory.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring if conditions or moving them outside loops when possible.
// Optimize loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction throughput.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to provide the compiler with more optimization opportunities by asserting non-aliasing pointers.
// Consider using shared memory to exploit data reuse within a block and reduce global memory accesses.
// Align the data to 128 bytes if possible to make the best use of GPU memory architecture.
