// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory addresses wherever possible.
// Evaluate the use of a constant memory for data that remain unchanged to improve cache performance.
// Minimize branching within the kernel to enhance warp execution efficiency.
// Analyze grid and block size configurations to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence.
