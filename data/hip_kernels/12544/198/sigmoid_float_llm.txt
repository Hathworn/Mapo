// Consider using shared memory for dy array if it's frequently accessed and fits in shared memory
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes to the result array
// Check if loop unrolling can help improve the performance within the while loop
// Evaluate if using __restrict__ keyword can improve memory access patterns
