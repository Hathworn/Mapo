```cpp
// Optimize memory access by increasing coalesced access patterns
// Reduce global memory accesses by effectively using shared memory
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for higher memory throughput
// Ensure optimal occupancy by choosing appropriate block and grid sizes
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory during reduction
```
