```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced global memory access
// Use warp shuffle operations for the reduction within the block to reduce synchronization overhead
// Consider adjusting block size to improve occupancy and balance shared memory usage
// Use a two-level reduction pattern where possible to decrease synchronization needed in the inner reduction
