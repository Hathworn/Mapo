```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if multiple threads require the same data
// Consider using atomic operations if updates to 'result' need to be synchronized across threads
// Adjust block and grid sizes to optimize occupancy and reduce warp divergence
// Use inlining functions where appropriate to reduce function call overhead
// Avoid unnecessary conditions inside the loop, perform such checks outside if possible
