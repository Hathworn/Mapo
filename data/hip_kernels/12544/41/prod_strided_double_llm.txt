```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using contiguous threads accessing contiguous memory locations
// Avoid conditional statements within the loop for optimal performance
// Consider using shared memory to accumulate local results before performing atomic operation
// Use `__device__` function cautiously if atomic operation contention is expected
// Minimize the frequency of atomic operations by reducing data beforehand
