```
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Check if using shared memory can optimize repeat accesses to the same data
// Evaluate if the use of warp-level primitives could enhance performance
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target hardware
// Analyze if pre-fetching data to registers improves memory latency
// Consider alternative formulations of the loop to minimize divergent branches
