```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for optimal performance
// Use shared memory if needed to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Adjust grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring conditionals if possible
