// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate values for dx and dy to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Try coalescing memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use __restrict__ pointers for dx, dy, and result to potentially help the compiler optimize memory access patterns.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp execute the same control path.
