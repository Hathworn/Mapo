```c
// Consider coalesced memory access where possible to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate the impact of using shared memory if operations per block are heavy to reduce global memory traffic.
// Investigate the warp size and ensure threads within the same warp access consecutive memory addresses.
// Minimize divergent branches to optimize warp execution efficiency.
// Ensure the kernel launch configurations (block and grid sizes) are optimized for the target GPU architecture.
