```cpp
// Coalesce memory accesses by having consecutive threads access consecutive elements in arrays a, b, and sum to maximize memory throughput.
// Ensure that all arrays are aligned in memory to avoid uncoalesced accesses.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider using float4 or similar types for vectorized loads/stores to improve data throughput.
// Optimize the grid and block sizes to achieve maximum occupancy and minimize idle threads.
