```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to cache data if there are repeated accesses to the same data
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions maximize the occupancy of the GPU
// Align data to 128-byte boundaries if possible to enable faster memory access
