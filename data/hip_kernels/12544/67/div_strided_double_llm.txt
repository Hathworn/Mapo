```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency if possible
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures properly
// Consider loop unrolling for better instruction throughput
// Minimize use of divergence in warp by aligning conditional checks
// Investigate whether prefetching data into registers can enhance performance
```
