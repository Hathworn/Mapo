```
// Consider memory coalescing by ensuring adjacent threads access adjacent memory locations in dy for better performance.
// Use shared memory if possible to minimize global memory accesses, especially if there are repeated accesses to the same data.
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are optimally chosen to fully utilize the GPU's resources, minimizing idle threads.
// Prefetch data into registers when beneficial to reduce the overhead of accessing global memory.
// Consider unrolling loops to increase instruction-level parallelism and hide latency.
