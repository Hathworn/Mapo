```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data that will be accessed multiple times to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing data access patterns to improve cache efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branches in the conditional checks, possibly using a more uniform control flow.
// Evaluate if atomic operations could be beneficial for combining results when multiple threads could write to the same memory location.
