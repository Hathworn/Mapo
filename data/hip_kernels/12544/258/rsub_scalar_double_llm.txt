// Consider coalesced memory access for dy array to improve memory throughput.
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access overlapping sections of dy.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to match the GPU architecture for maximized occupancy.
// Evaluate the impact of using __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to reduce memory aliasing.
