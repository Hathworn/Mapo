// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access by caching data in shared_dx and shared_dy arrays.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data loading and storing with warp size.
// Avoid redundant synchronization by verifying that shared memory writes and reads are conflict-free.
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring conditions uniformly apply across threads.
