// Consider coalescing memory accesses for dx and dy to improve memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory if beneficial to reduce global memory loads
// Ensure memory access patterns are aligned to avoid bank conflicts
// Evaluate increasing the block size to increase occupancy and improve performance
