```
// Consider coalesced memory access to increase memory access efficiency.
// Ensure 'dy' and 'result' arrays are memory-aligned for better performance.
// Minimize divergent branches by evaluating conditions outside critical loops if possible.
// Prefetch data into shared memory if data reuse benefits outweigh copy overhead.
