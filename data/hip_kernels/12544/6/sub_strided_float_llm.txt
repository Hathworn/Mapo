```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for dx and dy for improved memory performance
// Explore using shared memory to temporarily store dx or dy values to reduce global memory reads
// Ensure that all thread workloads are balanced to improve warp efficiency
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could provide performance benefits by reducing loop overhead
