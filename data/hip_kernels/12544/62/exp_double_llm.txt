```c
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for dy and result arrays
// Use shared memory to cache repeated access data
// Optimize block and grid dimensions based on target GPU architecture
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop
// Ensure alignment of data for better memory transaction efficiency
