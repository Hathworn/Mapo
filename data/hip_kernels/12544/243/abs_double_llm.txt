// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for reduced global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for increased computational throughput
// Optimize grid and block dimensions based on the GPU architecture and problem size
// Avoid divergence by restructuring conditional statements if possible
// Utilize memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency
