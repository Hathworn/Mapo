// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for dx and dy arrays.
// Consider aligning xOffset and yOffset to improve memory access.
// Evaluate if shared memory can be utilized to reduce global memory reads.
// Assess the impact of varying block and grid dimensions on performance.
// Minimize divergent branches by restructuring condition checks.
