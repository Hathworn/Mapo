```
// Utilize shared memory to cache data for coalesced access patterns
// Consider using memory fences to ensure memory consistency among threads
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to match the architecture's optimal occupancy
// Ensure data alignment for improved memory access efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel for better performance
