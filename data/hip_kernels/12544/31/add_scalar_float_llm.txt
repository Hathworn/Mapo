// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations in 'dy' and 'result' arrays.
// Use shared memory to temporarily store values if multiple operations on the same data are needed.
// Reduce divergence by minimizing conditional checks within the loop.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring 'dy' and 'result' are aligned appropriately.
