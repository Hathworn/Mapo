```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses when possible
// Avoid branch divergence to ensure all threads in a warp execute the same instruction
// Ensure coalesced memory access to reduce memory access latency and increase bandwidth
// Prefer arithmetic operations over memory operations when feasible
// Check for occupancy and adjust kernel configuration to improve utilization of resources
