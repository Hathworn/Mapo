```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring A, B, and C are allocated and accessed in a contiguous manner.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses within threads of the same block.
// Minimize thread divergence, ensure block dimensions are appropriate for the dataset size.
// Employ proper grid and block dimensions to fully utilize the GPU resources.
