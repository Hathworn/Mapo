```cpp
// Use shared memory to improve memory access patterns and reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure shared memory is used effectively by limiting the number of threads accessing it simultaneously
// Optimize thread synchronization to reduce the overhead of __syncthreads()
// Consider loop unrolling to improve execution efficiency in loops
// Ensure coalesced access for global memory reads/writes where possible
```
