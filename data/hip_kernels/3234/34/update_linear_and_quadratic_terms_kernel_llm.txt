```
// Consider preloading cur_tot_weight to shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Consider tiling the loop using shared memory to optimize memory coalescing.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce thread divergence.
// Ensure prior_scale_change computation is outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations.
// Utilize cooperative groups for efficient synchronization on linear array update.
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to better utilize GPU resources.
