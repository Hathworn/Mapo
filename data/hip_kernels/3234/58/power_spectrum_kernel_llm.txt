// Consider using shared memory to optimize access to Ar and Aw within the block.
// Prefetch data from global memory into shared memory for faster access.
// Minimize conditional branching to improve thread execution coherence and reduce warp divergence.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalesced memory operations, particularly for float2 data types.
// Calculate and use the correct stride for global memory access to minimize cache misses.
