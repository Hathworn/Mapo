```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache lifter_coeffs for efficient access.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to features array to improve load efficiency.
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring conditions where possible.
// Use loop unrolling for the lifter coefficients application loop for better performance.
