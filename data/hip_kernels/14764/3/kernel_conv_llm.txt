```
// Cache the values from global memory into registers to reduce memory access latency.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data to minimize global memory accesses.
// Avoid strided access patterns to better utilize memory coalescing in the kernel.
// Preload data into registers outside the loop to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Utilize vectorized operations if possible to increase memory throughput.
// Consider loop unrolling to improve computational efficiency and reduce loop overhead.
// Minimize divergent branching to maximize parallel execution efficiency.
// Align data structures to reduce memory access penalties.
// Use warp-level primitives to increase data reuse among threads and reduce memory traffic.
