```
// Consider using shared memory to improve memory access patterns and reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize thread divergence by ensuring conditional branches are minimized.
// Use constant memory for values like lenOf_ek if they remain unchanged to reduce repeated global memory access.
// Evaluate the possibility of loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and improve latency.
// Assess coalescing potential by ensuring aligned memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Pre-fetch required data to registers where possible for faster access and reduced latency.
