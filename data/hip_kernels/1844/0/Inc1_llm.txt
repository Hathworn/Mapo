```
// Load Ad[tx] once outside the loop to reduce memory access.
// Use a temporary variable to hold Ad[tx] value and update it, minimizing global memory writes.
// Synchronize threads to ensure consistent data across all threads within a block.
// Write to Bd[tx] once per iteration to minimize write operations.
