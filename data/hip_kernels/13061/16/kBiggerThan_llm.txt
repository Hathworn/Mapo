// Consider using shared memory for repetitive data access in threads
// Use coalesced memory access patterns for gMat1 and gMat2 to increase bandwidth usage efficiency
// Verify using constant memory if gMat1 or gMat2 contain constant data across threads
// Ensure gMatTarget is accessed in a coalesced manner to optimize write operations
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for further performance gains
