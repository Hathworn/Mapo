```
// Use shared memory to cache gData elements if multiple threads access the same elements.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring threads in a warp access contiguous memory addresses.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency.
// Consider using float2 or similar structures for vectorized memory access to improve throughput.
