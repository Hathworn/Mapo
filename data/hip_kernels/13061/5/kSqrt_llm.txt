```
// Consider using shared memory for repeated accesses if gData[i] is reused often
// Ensure memory access pattern is coalesced for gData and target arrays
// Check for memory alignment for gData and target to improve access speed
// Use float4 or float2 to load/store multiple float values at once to enhance memory throughput
// Verify the ideal block and grid size for the target GPU architecture to maximize occupancy
