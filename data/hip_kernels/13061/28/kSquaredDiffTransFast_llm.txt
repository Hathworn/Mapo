// Ensure coalesced memory access to optimize global load/store operations
// Incorporate shared memory usage to reduce global memory accesses
// Align shared memory array for reduced bank conflicts
// Prefetch data into shared memory to minimize wait time for data access
// Carefully manage thread synchronization to prevent race conditions
