```
// Use shared memory for vec to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider vectorizing operations using float4 or similar types
// Ensure memory coalescing by checking memory access patterns
// Optimize blockDim and gridDim based on specific GPU architecture
// Use asynchronous memory copies if applicable to reduce latency
```
