```
// Consider coalesced memory access for mat and tgtMat to optimize global memory access
// Use shared memory to cache vec elements to reduce repeated global memory access
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure optimal use of available computing resources
// Consider loop unrolling if it benefits performance and if space is available
