```
// Use shared memory for vector to reduce global memory access
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() after loading shared memory
// Align shared memory size to ensure best memory transactions
// Consider coalesced access pattern for reading from mat and writing to tgtMat
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize device occupancy
