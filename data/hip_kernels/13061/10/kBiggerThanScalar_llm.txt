```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergence by ensuring each warp processes contiguous elements
// Allocate and use registers efficiently for scalar comparison
// Employ vectorized memory loads if applicable to improve bandwidth utilization
// Unroll loop to better utilize resources and improve throughput
// Ensure memory alignment to maximize coalescing and reduce latency
