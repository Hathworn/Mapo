// Ensure memory coalescing by reading matrix data into shared memory
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Implement padding in shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have completed the shared memory store
// Optimize global memory access patterns by aligning with warp size
