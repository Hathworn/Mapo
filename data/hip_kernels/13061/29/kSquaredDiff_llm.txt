```c
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for common data
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Ensure memory alignment to maximize memory transaction efficiency
// Optimize the usage of registers to enhance performance
// Minimize branching within each kernel to improve execution speed
