```
// Ensure blockDim.x * gridDim.x is optimized for GPU architecture
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve throughput
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for gData and target if possible
// Consider using shared memory to further reduce global memory traffic
// Experiment with loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
```
