```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning threads to memory addresses
// Minimize bank conflicts by optimizing shared memory usage
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
// Use __restrict__ qualifier to allow compiler better optimization
// Use warp-synchronous programming where appropriate
