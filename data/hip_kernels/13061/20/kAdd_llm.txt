```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for 'a' and 'b'
// Ensure shared memory usage is within hardware limits
// Reduce the number of __syncthreads() calls for efficiency
// Align shared memory allocation to warp size if possible
// Assess using vectorized memory operations for a, b, and dest arrays
// Profile memory bandwidth utilization and optimize accordingly
