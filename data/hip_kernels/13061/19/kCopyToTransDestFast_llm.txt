// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning srcStart and destStart pointers.
// Try increasing the COPY_BLOCK_SIZE to maximize usage of shared memory.
// Consider using vectorized types (e.g., float4) to optimize memory loads and stores.
// Ensure grid and block sizes are configured to best fit the input dimensions for occupancy.
