```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing 'a' and 'dest' data in a sequential pattern
// Check bounds for 'transIndex' to ensure safe memory access and prevent out-of-bounds
// Use constants for 'scaleA' and 'scaleB' to capitalize on compiler optimizations
// Reduce unnecessary calculations inside the loop by precomputing outside if possible
