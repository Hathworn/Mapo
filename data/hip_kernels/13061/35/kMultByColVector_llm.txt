```
// Consider optimizing the memory access pattern by using shared memory for vec, which can reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure enough threads are available to fully utilize the compute units, possibly by tuning blockDim.x.
// If possible, check memory coalescing for mat and tgtMat to ensure efficient access.
