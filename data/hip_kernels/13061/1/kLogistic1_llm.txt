// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for gData and target to optimize memory access
// Evaluate the usage of shared memory to reduce global memory access for tanhf computations
// Assess potential benefits of loop unrolling for the for loop to enhance performance
// Investigate coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
