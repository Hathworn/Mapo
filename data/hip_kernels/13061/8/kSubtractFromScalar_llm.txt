```
// Use shared memory to cache data if threads access nearby elements
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Consider using __restrict__ to inform the compiler about non-aliasing pointers
// Optimize loop by unrolling to enhance performance
// Validate block size and grid size for optimal occupancy
