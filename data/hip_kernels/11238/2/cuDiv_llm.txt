```
// Ensure arrays a, b, and result are allocated in unified memory
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to help the compiler with optimizations
// Allocate memory with hipMallocManaged for zero-copy access between CPU and GPU
// Prefetch memory to GPU before kernel execution to reduce overhead
```
