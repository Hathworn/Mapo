```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure that memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Use __restrict__ keyword if pointers are not aliased to improve compiler optimizations
// Check if reducing the number of iterations can maintain performance while saving resources
