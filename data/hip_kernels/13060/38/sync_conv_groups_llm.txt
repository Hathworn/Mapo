// Consider memory coalescing techniques to improve data access patterns.
// Explore shared memory usage to reduce global memory access latency.
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied in other parts of the code for performance benefits.
// Evaluate if prefetching techniques could be beneficial depending on the computation sequence.
