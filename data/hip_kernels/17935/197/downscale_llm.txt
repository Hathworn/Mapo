```cpp
// Use shared memory to buffer frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for intra-warp cooperation to further reduce memory access overhead.
// Optimize memory access patterns to coalesce global memory transactions when accessing gradOutput_data.
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are chosen to maximize occupancy while minimizing idle threads.
