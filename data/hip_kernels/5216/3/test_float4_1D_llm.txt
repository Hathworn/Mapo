```
// Use coalesced memory access for better performance
// Minimize texture fetches by caching results when possible
// Ensure texture fetch addresses are aligned to improve access speed
// Optimize block and grid sizes to fully utilize the GPU cores
// Evaluate if using shared memory could provide additional speedups
