```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Align data access patterns with cache lines to reduce memory latency.
// Utilize shared memory for intermediate computations if applicable.
// Optimize thread occupancy to improve parallel execution efficiency.
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to reduce branch divergence.
// Prefetch data to hide memory latency efficiently.
