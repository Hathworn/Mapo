// Consider the use of shared memory for accessing texture data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Ensure that the texture memory accesses are coalesced to improve performance
// Check for optimal alignment of memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts
// Consider reorganizing data layout to improve spatial locality during texture fetches
// Explore the use of memory prefetching techniques to improve data availability in registers
// Verify that the block and grid dimensions maximize occupancy and adhere to hardware constraints
