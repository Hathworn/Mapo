// Consider using shared memory to store coefImg for frequent access
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for global memory optimizations
// Explore using vectorized operations to process multiple elements together
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory to maximize efficiency
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform control flow across threads
// Evaluate the use of asynchronous copy for overlapping computations with memory transfers
