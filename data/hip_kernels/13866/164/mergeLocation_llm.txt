```
// Consider using shared memory for temporarily storing loc_ data to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced by verifying that loc_ data is aligned
// Use __syncthreads() if shared memory is implemented to ensure proper synchronization
// Evaluate the use of __ldg() intrinsic for potentially improved read access to loc_ if applicable
