```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if multiple threads access nearby memory locations
// Apply memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to allow compiler optimizations
// Ensure that the grid and block dimensions are optimized for the target hardware
