```
// Consider coalesced memory access for reading flow vectors u and v.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads.
// Ensure src values are read in a coalesced manner.
// Consider using fast math functions for __float2int_rn if precision allows.
// Preload frequently accessed values to keep them in registers.
// Consider using texture memory if applicable for better cache performance.
