```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Load uniform value into shared memory to reduce global memory reads.
// Ensure that __syncthreads() is used after loading into shared memory.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergence by aligning operations within threads of the same warp.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by aligning the address.
