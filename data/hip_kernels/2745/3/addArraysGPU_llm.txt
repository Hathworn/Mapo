```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring contiguous memory access in each warp
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to decrease global memory reads
// Check if loop unrolling can be applied for better pipeline utilization
// Verify alignment of memory access for efficient data load/store
// Examine if memory prefetching is beneficial for the current data pattern
