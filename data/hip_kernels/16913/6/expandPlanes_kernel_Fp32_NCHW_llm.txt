```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Load inputs into shared memory in chunks to optimize memory bandwidth.
// Calculate shmemIdx once to avoid redundant computation.
// Minimize conditional checks inside the loop to improve performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning index calculations.
