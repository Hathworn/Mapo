```
// Store frequently accessed values in local variables to enhance memory access speed
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently used data
// Ensure memory coalescing by organizing threads in a manner that accesses continuous memory segments
// Avoid using printf in GPU code for performance-sensitive sections to prevent overhead
