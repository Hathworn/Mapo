```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance
// Use constant memory for small data that is frequently accessed
// Ensure data alignment for efficient memory access
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads follow the same execution path
