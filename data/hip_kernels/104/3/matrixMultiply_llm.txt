```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for A and B to enhance performance
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling for additional performance gains
// Align matrix dimensions to TILE_WIDTH for potential padding optimization
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
```
