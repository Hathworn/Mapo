// Consider using shared memory to cache add array values for faster access.
// Optimize global memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced access.
// Ensure memory accesses within threads of a warp are coalesced.
// Utilize __syncthreads() appropriately to ensure all threads have loaded blockAdd before using.
