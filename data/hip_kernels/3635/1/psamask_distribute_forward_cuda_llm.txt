```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory reads
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Explore use of texture memory for read-only data to take advantage of cache mechanisms
// Attempt to increase the occupancy by optimizing block and grid dimensions
