```
// Optimize memory coalescing by reordering memory access patterns for mask_diff and buffer_diff.
// Minimize divergence in mask loop by flattening h and w levels into a single loop.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed values from buffer_diff.
// Consider splitting the mask computation into smaller tiles to improve cache utilization.
// Reduce redundant calculations for mask_idx and buffer_idx by precomputing common terms.
