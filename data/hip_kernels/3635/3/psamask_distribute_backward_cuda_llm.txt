```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access inside nested for-loops.
// Unroll loops where possible to decrease loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.
// Fuse loops if beneficial, to reduce loop overhead and improve data locality.
// Check if prefetching data to shared memory can be beneficial before computation begins.
