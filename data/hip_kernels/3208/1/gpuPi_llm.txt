```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory for intermediate results to reduce global memory access
// Minimize use of atomic operations or explore warp-level primitives if possible
// Ensure the loop has sufficient iterations per thread to optimize instruction execution
// Optimize loop iteration by reducing computational overhead within the loop
