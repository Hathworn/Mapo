```
// Use shared memory to store a tile of d_matrix to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_matrix by having each thread access consecutive elements
// Consider using loop unrolling to optimize the kernel loop execution
// Minimize register usage by optimizing the sum calculation
// Investigate the use of texture memory for d_kernel as it may offer better caching characteristics
