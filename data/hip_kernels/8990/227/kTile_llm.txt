```
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Consider using compiler hints like __restrict__ to optimize memory access
// Unroll loops manually if compiler is unable to do it efficiently
// Try to maximize occupancy by tweaking block size and grid size
