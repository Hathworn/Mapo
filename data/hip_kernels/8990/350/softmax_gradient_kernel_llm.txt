```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for Y, dY, and dX arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Implement double buffering to overlap computation with memory transfers to shared memory.
// Explore usage of bank conflict free shared memory accesses.
// Optimize reduction using warp shuffle instead of shared memory to reduce synchronization overhead.
