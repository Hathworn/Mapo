```
// Utilize loop unrolling to minimize memory access and improve throughput
// Align memory accesses to ensure coalescing and reduce latency
// Opt for shared memory in reduction to lower global memory writes
// Employ early exit conditions to reduce unnecessary computations
// Increase block size for better occupancy and efficient use of shared memory
// Ensure atomic operations on global memory writes if concurrent access possible
