```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse is possible.
// Ensure that the pointer to accuracy is aligned for coalesced memory access.
// Evaluate if multiple elements need similar operation for thread-level parallelism.
// Optimize the kernel launch configuration if this kernel is called repeatedly.
// Minimize data movement by reducing the number of global memory operations.
