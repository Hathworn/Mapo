```
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data
// Pre-compute and store repeated calculations in registers
// Minimize accesses to global memory by using shared memory for gradOutput_data
// Ensure coalesced access when reading gradOutput_data
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to help the compiler optimize memory accesses
// Align data structures to 32-byte boundaries to maximize memory bandwidth
// Consider adjusting block and grid dimensions to optimize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
