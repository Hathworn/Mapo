```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly in memory
// Minimize the use of thread synchronization to enhance parallel performance
// Consider using warp-level operations if applicable to optimize memory usage
```
