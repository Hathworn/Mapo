```
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing gradOutput_data with contiguous threads accessing contiguous memory locations
// Usage of __restrict__ keyword can help the compiler optimize memory access
// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data as it is faster than global memory
// Avoid redundant calculations inside the loops, precompute values outside if possible
// Minimize divergent warps by ensuring that all threads in a warp can follow the same execution path
