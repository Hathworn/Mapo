// Consider using shared memory to store results temporarily before writing to global memory
// Optimize memory access pattern by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Reduce the use of conditional checks within the loops for improved parallel execution
// Avoid recalculating values inside the kernel; precompute constants if possible
