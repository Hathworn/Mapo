```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic when accessing states
// Optimize memory alignment for states to improve access patterns
// Minimize register usage and thread divergence in the kernel
// Consider loop unrolling techniques if applicable within the kernel
// Check and optimize for warp execution efficiency
