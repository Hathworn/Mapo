```
// Use shared memory to store results locally before writing to global memory.
// Reorder computations to improve access pattern for coalesced memory accesses.
// Consider loop unrolling if repeated computations are present.
// Align memory accesses to reduce bank conflicts and improve throughput.
// Optimize block size and grid dimension based on device's compute capabilities.
