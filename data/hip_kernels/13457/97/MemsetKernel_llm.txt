```
// Use shared memory where possible to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses for improved bandwidth utilization
// Consider loop unrolling for predictable iterations
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures for optimized access patterns
// Minimize conditional statements inside the kernel for better warp execution
