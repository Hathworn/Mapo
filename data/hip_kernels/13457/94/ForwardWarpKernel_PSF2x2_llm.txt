```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data access for u, v, and src.
// Pre-calculate flow_row_offset and image_row_offset to avoid repetitive calculations.
// Use modff function to split into integer and fractional parts, reducing compute overhead.
// Minimize branching by arranging conditions from most to least likely.
// Leverage shared memory if feasible to cache src inputs and reduce global memory traffic.
// Explore usage of float4 for memory operations to decrease load/store instructions.
// Consolidate atomic operations where possible to decrease contention.
// Consider loop unrolling for pixel-filling operations to reduce loop overhead.
// Analyze thread block size for optimal occupancy and memory throughput.
