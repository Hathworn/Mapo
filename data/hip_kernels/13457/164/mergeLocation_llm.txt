```
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to reduce pointer aliasing overhead
// Ensure coalesced memory access by organizing data for warp execution
// Load data into shared memory to minimize global memory access if reusable
// Consider using float2 for combined x and y to enhance memory access efficiency
