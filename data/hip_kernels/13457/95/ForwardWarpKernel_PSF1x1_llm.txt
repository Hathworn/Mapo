```
// Consider coalesced memory access for arrays u, v, and src by ensuring each thread reads sequential elements.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed data like u_, v_ to reduce global memory access.
// Consider optimizing the range check for tx and ty to avoid branching.
// Use __syncthreads() if data dependencies exist to ensure memory updates are visible to all threads.
