// Consider unrolling the initialization loop to improve performance.
// Use padding to minimize shared memory bank conflicts.
// Ensure that atomic operations are minimized or optimized.
// Cache frequently accessed global memory data in shared memory.
// Use a loop unrolling technique to reduce loop overhead and increase speed.
