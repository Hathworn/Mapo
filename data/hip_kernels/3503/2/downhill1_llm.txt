```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_value to improve memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory if possible to store d_value and reduce global memory transactions
// Ensure d_key is accessed in a coalesced way to maximize memory throughput
// Preload frequently accessed elements into registers to decrease memory latency
```
