```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed values to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring all threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider employing loop unrolling to reduce branch divergence and improve thread utilization.
// Use unsigned data types for indices where possible to avoid unnecessary sign conversion overhead.
// Check the occupancy of kernel launches and adjust block size or grid size appropriately for better resource use.
