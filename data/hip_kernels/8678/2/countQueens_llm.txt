```c
// Use boundary checks to halt threads early that are outside of the problem scope for efficiency
// Allocate memory to shared memory to reduce frequent accesses to global memory
// Unroll critical loops to lessen branching divergence and improve the performance
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize redundant calculations
```
