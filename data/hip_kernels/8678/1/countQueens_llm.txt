```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase data locality.
// Preload thread-specific data into registers to minimize memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns in loops to utilize memory bandwidth efficiently.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can benefit performance by reducing branch divergence.
