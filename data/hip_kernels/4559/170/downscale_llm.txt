// Optimize memory access by ensuring memory coalescing
// Consider reordering loops to improve spatial locality
// Explore use of shared memory for storing intermediate values
// Align memory accesses to warp boundaries
// Consider minimizing divergent branches within loops 
// Prefetch data to reduce memory access latency
// Consider using vectorized operations to increase throughput
