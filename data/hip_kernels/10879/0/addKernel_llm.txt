```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data locally for faster access
// Minimize bank conflicts by padding shared memory where necessary
// Optimize memory access patterns by structuring data for coalesced access
// Reduce divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Pre-fetch data to registers when possible to reduce memory latency
