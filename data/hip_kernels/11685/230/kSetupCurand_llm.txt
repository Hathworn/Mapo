// Use shared memory to store repeated data to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling to optimize calculation within the kernel
// Implement occupancy calculator to determine ideal number of threads and blocks
// Evaluate usage of atomic operations to minimize serialization
