```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers a, b, and target to facilitate compiler optimizations.
// Ensure data alignment for improved performance, particularly with global memory accesses.
// Optimize the loop unrolling strategy to further reduce loop overhead and enhance performance.
// Use padding in shared memory if necessary to prevent bank conflicts during shared memory accesses.
// Assess the grid and block size configuration for optimal occupancy and performance.
// Use efficient memory access patterns to take advantage of coalesced memory accesses in global memory.
