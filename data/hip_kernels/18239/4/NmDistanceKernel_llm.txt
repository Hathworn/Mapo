```c
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning data structures.
// Utilize `__shared__` memory effectively to reduce global memory traffic.
// Consider increasing batch size for better shared memory utilization, with respect to the hardware limits.
// Minimize the usage of `__syncthreads()` to prevent unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Optimize use of registers by limiting the live range of variables where possible.
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by reducing conditional branching within the innermost loop.
// Consider using half-precision if the precision requirements permit, for improved performance on compatible hardware.
