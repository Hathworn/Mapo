```
// Consider coalesced memory access for xyz1 and xyz2 arrays
// Optimize memory access patterns to reduce the number of global memory transactions
// Use shared memory for xyz1 and xyz2 to minimize global memory accesses
// Perform loop unrolling for accessing xyz1 and xyz2 coordinates
// Experiment with different thread block sizes to maximize occupancy and reduce warp divergence
