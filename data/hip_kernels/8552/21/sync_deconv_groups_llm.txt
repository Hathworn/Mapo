```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads
// Minimize use of global memory and maximize use of registers
// Use loop unrolling for better performance in computational loops
// Ensure memory alignment for faster data transfer
// Consider occupancy tuning by adjusting block and grid sizes
