```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for `u`, `v`, and `src` by adjusting the memory layout
// Align memory accesses for `dst` to improve write throughput
// Use shared memory to store `u`, `v`, and `src` values if possible to leverage faster memory access
// Ensure `atomicAdd` usage is minimized by accumulating values in shared memory if feasible
// Explore loop unrolling for threads accessing consecutive indices to increase instruction-level parallelism
