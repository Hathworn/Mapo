```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input and kernel to enhance global memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store often-used data to reduce global memory accesses
// Use loop unrolling for kernel computation to reduce loop overhead and increase ILP
// Ensure shared memory bank conflicts are minimized when multiple threads access shared_output
// Prefetch data into shared memory before usage to hide memory latency
