```cpp
// Consider aligning data accesses for coalesced memory operations
// Ensure end_ptr alignment with unsigned int for proper pointer arithmetic
// Utilize shared memory to minimize repeated global memory access
// Optimize loop unrolling to improve performance for specific architectures
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size or shared memory to enhance utilization
