```
// Ensure coalesced memory access for improved memory performance
// Minimize divergence in control flow to improve warp efficiency
// Optimize use of shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Reuse loaded values where possible to reduce redundant reads
// Align memory access to meet hardware-specific requirements
```
