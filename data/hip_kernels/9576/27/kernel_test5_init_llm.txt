```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring that ptr accesses consecutive memory locations.
// Unroll outer loop to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction level parallelism.
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency. 
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access similar data patterns.
```
