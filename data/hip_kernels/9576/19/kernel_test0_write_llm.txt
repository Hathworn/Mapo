```
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for maximum efficiency
// Minimize memory divergence to improve warp execution efficiency
// Align data access to reduce potential memory access issues
// Consider using shared memory if patterns are frequently reused
// Strive for optimal block and grid size to maximize occupancy
