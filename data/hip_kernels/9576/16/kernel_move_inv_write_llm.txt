```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data properly to increase memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques if the pattern is predictable to hide memory latency.
// Minimize divergent execution paths by avoiding conditional statements when possible.
