```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring ptr is aligned to improve performance
// Minimize synchronization by using warp-based operations when possible
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Use asynchronous memory copies for overlapping computation and memory transfer
```
