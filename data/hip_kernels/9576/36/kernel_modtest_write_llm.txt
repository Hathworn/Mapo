```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses
// Minimize memory usage by using shared memory if possible
// Use loop unrolling if the loop iteration count is known and small
// Remove redundant calculations outside the loop to reduce overhead
// Use __restrict__ qualifier on pointers to facilitate compiler optimizations
// Consider using vectorized data types for wider memory load/store
```
