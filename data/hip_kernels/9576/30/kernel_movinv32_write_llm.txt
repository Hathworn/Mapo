// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed variables to minimize global memory reads.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures with warp size on 32-bit boundaries.
// Minimize conditional checks within the kernel loop to improve execution efficiency.
// Eliminate potential warp divergence by minimizing conditional branches among threads.
