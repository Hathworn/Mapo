// Consider using __ldg() for read-only data to optimize memory bandwidth by utilizing texture cache.
// Use warp shuffle operations for efficient data exchange within a warp to minimize shared memory usage and synchronization overhead.
// Investigate using cooperative groups to perform synchronization across blocks if necessary for fine-grained parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures appropriately to maximize memory throughput.
