```
// Use coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses to warp boundaries
// Recompute values instead of storing them in registers if register pressure is high
// Ensure memory accesses stay within the allocated block to avoid segmentation faults
// Use shared memory if the data can be reused by threads within the same block
// Consider using atomic operations if shared data needs to be updated by multiple threads
