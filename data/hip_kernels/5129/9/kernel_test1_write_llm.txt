```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce warp divergence
// Ensure that memory addresses accessed by threads in a warp are contiguous to optimize global memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory accesses when possible
// Prefetch data into registers to hide global memory latency
