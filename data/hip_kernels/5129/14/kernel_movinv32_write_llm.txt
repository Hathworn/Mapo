```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning the pointer to warp size.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by padding where necessary.
// Unroll loops to allow for better instruction level parallelism.
// Consider using asynchronous memory operations to hide memory latency.
// Use vectorized data types (e.g., int2) to increase memory throughput.
