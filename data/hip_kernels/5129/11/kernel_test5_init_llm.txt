```
// Consider aligning memory access to ensure coalesced memory transactions
// Check if the BLOCKSIZE is an appropriate multiple of warp size for optimal performance
// Ensure shared memory usage if data reuse patterns exist to reduce global memory access
// Look for opportunities to use vectorized operations for better memory throughput
// Review loop unrolling factors to better match data access patterns to cache line sizes
