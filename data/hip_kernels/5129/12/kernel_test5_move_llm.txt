```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for optimal performance
// Use __syncthreads() only when absolutely necessary to minimize overhead
// Align global memory operations to improve memory throughput
// Ensure that BLOCKSIZE is a multiple of warp size for best performance
// Optimize the stride in loops to reduce bank conflicts in shared memory
```
