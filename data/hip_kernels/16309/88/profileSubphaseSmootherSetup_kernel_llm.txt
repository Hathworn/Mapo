```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Coalesce global memory accesses to make them more efficient
// Minimize thread divergence to ensure better utilization of GPU resources
// Prefer using registers for frequently accessed data
// Consider loop unrolling to increase the number of instructions per cycle
// Optimize the computation to maximize occupancy
