```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better memory throughput.
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to avoid bank conflicts.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Try using registers for frequently accessed variables.
// Minimize divergent warps within this kernel.
// Examine occupancy levels to determine if tuning block size can improve performance.
