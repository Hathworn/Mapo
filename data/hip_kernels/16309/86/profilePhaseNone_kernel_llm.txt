```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for optimal performance.
// Ensure that global memory accesses are contiguous.
// Utilize shared memory if there are any repetitive accesses.
// Minimize memory transactions by optimizing data handling.
// Align data structures to enable wider memory transactions.
// Aim to reduce bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Evaluate the benefit of using texture memory for read-only data.
