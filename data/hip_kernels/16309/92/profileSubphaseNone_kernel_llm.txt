// Consider using shared memory for data reuse to optimize global memory accesses
// Launch kernels with suitable block sizes to maximize occupancy
// Utilize coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Check for opportunities to reduce global memory traffic through computation reuse
// Explore using constant memory for frequently accessed data
