```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structures properly
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring threads in a warp follow similar execution paths
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed data that does not change
```
