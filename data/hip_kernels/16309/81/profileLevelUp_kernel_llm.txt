```
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access.
// Consider utilizing __shared__ memory more effectively to reduce global memory access latency.
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization by minimizing __syncthreads() calls.
// Ensure data alignment to improve memory access efficiency.
