```
// Consider coalesced memory access for improved bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory latency.
// Ensure the computation fully occupies warp size for efficiency.
// Optimize grid and block size to maximize GPU occupancy.
// Use memory access patterns that align with cache line size.
