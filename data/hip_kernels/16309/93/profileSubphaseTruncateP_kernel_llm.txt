```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to reduce global memory transactions
// Ensure the shared memory size is appropriate for block size and adjust as necessary
// Synchronize threads to handle dependencies in shared memory operations
// Utilize conditional checks to avoid out-of-bound memory access
// Improve performance by minimizing printf usage within the kernel
