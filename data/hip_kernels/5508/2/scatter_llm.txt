// Consider coalesced memory access for d_in and d_index arrays to improve bandwidth utilization
// Ensure d_out writes are coalesced to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Utilize shared memory to further reduce global memory access if applicable
// Minimize bank conflicts if shared memory is used
