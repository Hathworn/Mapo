```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency for d_mask and d_scan
// Coalesce global memory accesses by aligning d_index, d_scan, and d_mask
// Consider using warp shuffles to reduce divergence when calculating d_index
// Minimize use of thread synchronization for better performance
// Profile memory access patterns to identify further bottlenecks
