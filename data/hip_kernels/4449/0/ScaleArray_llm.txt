```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by using continuous memory addresses
// Use shared memory if multiple threads need to access the same data
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing data in registers
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead
// Balance workload by choosing appropriate block and grid size
