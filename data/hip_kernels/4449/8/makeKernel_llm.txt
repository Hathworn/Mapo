// Minimize redundant calculations by precomputing invariant values outside the loop
// Use shared memory for commonly accessed variables to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory access patterns for improved cache efficiency
// Employ loop unrolling techniques where applicable to enhance performance
// Reduce thread divergence by ensuring consistent condition checks across threads
