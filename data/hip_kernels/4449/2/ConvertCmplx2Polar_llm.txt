```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for inRe and inIm
// Ensure alignment and padding of shared memory for optimal access
// Minimize synchronization by restructuring computation and memory loading
// Reduce redundant instructions by reusing computed values where possible
// Consider loop unrolling technique for improved execution performance
