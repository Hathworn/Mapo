// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by accessing consecutive elements
// Minimize divergence by structuring the code to reduce branch conditions
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access nearby data
// Use appropriate block size to maximize occupancy and ensure high memory utilization
