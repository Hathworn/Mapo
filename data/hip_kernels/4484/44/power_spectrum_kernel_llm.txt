// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency for Ar and Aw arrays.
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory addresses.
// Evaluate the use of a larger number of threads per block to increase parallelism.
// Investigate the memory alignment of the Ar and Aw arrays for optimal performance.
