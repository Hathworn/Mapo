```cpp
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using __syncthreads() to synchronize threads if shared memory is implemented.
// Use of atomicAdd is efficient here because only a single thread handles linear update.
```
