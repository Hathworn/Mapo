```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Avoid bank conflicts by ensuring shared memory accesses are properly aligned
// Minimize conditional statements within kernel to improve execution efficiency
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce instruction overhead
// Use register variables for frequently accessed data to reduce memory access
