```
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve performance
// Ensure memory coalescing by properly accessing global memory in a sequential manner
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by using padding if necessary
// Minimize synchronization points (__syncthreads()) to reduce overhead
// Load data in chunks that fit into shared memory to maximize data reuse
// Balance load across threads and blocks to optimize resource utilization
