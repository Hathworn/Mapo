```
// Ensure sufficient threads are launched to cover all cases
// Consider using loop unrolling if numOut is known at compile time
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid branch divergence by structuring conditional statements effectively
// Preload maxp into shared memory if reused across threads
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions for efficient reductions
