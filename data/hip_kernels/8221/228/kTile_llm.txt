```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Align src and tgt to 128-byte boundaries for better performance
// Use shared memory if there is data re-use between threads
// Ensure that numThreads is a multiple of warp size (32) for efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes for optimal kernel execution
