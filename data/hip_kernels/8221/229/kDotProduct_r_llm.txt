// Use register for partial sum to reduce global memory accesses
// Unroll loop to improve memory access and increase throughput
// Utilize shared memory for intra-block reduction to minimize global memory usage
// Employ __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have written to shared memory
// Optimize reduction using warp-level operations for final steps to improve performance
// Minimize divergence by ensuring synchronized reduction across threads
