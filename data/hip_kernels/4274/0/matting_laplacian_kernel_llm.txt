```
// Consider using shared memory to store `input` values for threads within the same block to reduce global memory access.
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when accessing `input` and `grad` arrays to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Align memory access to ensure that as many threads as possible read inputs simultaneously to maximize bandwidth usage.
// Minimize branch divergence in the binary search section by ensuring consistent execution paths across threads.
// Ensure that `CSR_rowIdx`, `CSR_colIdx`, and `CSR_val` accesses are coalesced wherever possible to improve memory throughput.
// Precompute or cache invariant calculations outside of loops to reduce redundant computations within the kernel.
