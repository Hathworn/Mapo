// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data locality.
// Ensure that guide data fits into shared memory for effective usage.
// Optimize the memory access for the affine_model and filtered_affine_model arrays.
// Calculate color differences locally using shared memory to minimize repetitive global fetches.
// Avoid uncoalesced global memory access for guide using shared memory arrays.
// Synchronize shared memory accesses with __syncthreads() to ensure data consistency within a block.
