```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access
// Consider using float instead of double if precision allows, to improve performance
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to optimize memory bandwidth usage
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to signal no aliasing and enable further optimizations
// Minimize branching within kernel to improve warp execution efficiency
// Explore occupancy levels and adjust block size to optimize hardware usage
// Employ asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation and data movement
```
