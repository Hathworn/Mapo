```
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider aligning data structures to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the architecture
// Use appropriate launch configurations to maximize occupancy
