```
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed values to reduce global memory read latency
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transaction overhead
// Ensure proper thread synchronization if accessing shared resources
// Minimize divergent branches within warp to ensure efficient execution
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and resource utilization
