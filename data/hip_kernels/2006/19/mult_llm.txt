```
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize reading a[i] and b[i]
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing wasted space
// Check if the block size is a power of two for optimal reduction
// Ensure shared memory usage does not exceed hardware limits
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access during reduction
// Align data access patterns with memory boundaries
