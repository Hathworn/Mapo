```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Consider using shared memory if 'a' or 'result' are accessed multiple times by threads.
// Check if prefetching data to L1/L2 cache can improve performance.
// Investigate if loop unrolling can provide additional performance benefits.
// Ensure optimal block and grid size configuration for best occupancy.
// If 'b' is constant, declare it as 'const' to facilitate compiler optimizations.
