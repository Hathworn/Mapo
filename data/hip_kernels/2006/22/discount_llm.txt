```c
// Use shared memory to store temporary results to minimize global memory accesses.
// Loop unrolling can be applied to further optimize the reduction operation.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Optimize the use of registers by minimizing variable lifetimes within the kernel.
