// Ensure coalesced memory access for a, b, and result arrays by aligning data structures
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data if appropriate
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to match hardware capabilities for maximum warp efficiency
// Minimize register usage to allow more threads per block for better occupancy
// Investigate using pinned memory for faster host-device data transfer
