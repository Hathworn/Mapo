// Consider coalescing memory accesses by ensuring continuous memory access for threads in each warp.
// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
// Ensure proper memory alignment to leverage memory coalescing efficiently.
// Consider using loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead.
// Evaluate the use of cache by rearranging computations to improve cache locality.
// Minimize divergent branching to reduce the overhead of non-coalesced execution paths.
