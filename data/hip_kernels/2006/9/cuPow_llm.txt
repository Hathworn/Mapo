```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous thread access to a[] elements
// Optimize power computation with intrinsic functions if b is a constant
// Minimize divergent code paths by ensuring all threads execute the same instructions
