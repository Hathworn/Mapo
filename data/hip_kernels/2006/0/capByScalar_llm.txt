// Consider coalescing memory access for array 'a' to enhance bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure 'result' memory is accessed in a coalesced manner to improve performance.
// Minimize divergent warps by ensuring similar execution paths within the conditional block.
// Explore shared memory usage if the input data 'a' is reused across threads or blocks.
