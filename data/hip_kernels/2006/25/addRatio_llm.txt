```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Ensure that the input vectors a, b, and c are aligned in memory to improve throughput.
// Use shared memory if there are patterns of data reuse within the blocks to minimize global memory accesses.
// Check for bank conflicts if utilizing shared memory for further potential optimization.
// Evaluate if using vectorized loads and stores can enhance memory bandwidth utilization.
// If feasible, balance compute to memory access ratio to hide memory latencies.
