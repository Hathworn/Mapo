// Consider coalesced memory access for input arrays a and b
// Use shared memory to avoid bank conflicts for reduction
// Ensure all threads write to shared memory for consistent behavior
// Consider loop unrolling for further performance enhancement
// Optimize use of __syncthreads to minimize synchronization overhead
