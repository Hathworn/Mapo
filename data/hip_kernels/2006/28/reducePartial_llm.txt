// Use fewer shared memory allocations for improved efficiency
// Load data into shared memory with bounds checking to minimize memory access latency
// Perform computations in shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth usage
// Optimize parallel reduction with shared memory to decrease synchronization overhead
