// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced accesses for a and b arrays.
// Prefetch data from global memory to registers to hide latency.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could provide performance benefits for grid stride loop.
