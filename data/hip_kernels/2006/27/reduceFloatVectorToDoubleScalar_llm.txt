```
// Consider using __ldg() to load fdata to leverage cached loads.
// Use shared memory with loop unrolling to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize thread divergence by applying conditional operators.
// Pre-fetch data to shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth use.
// Optimize warp divergence by ensuring even work distribution among threads.
// Ensure memory coalescing where accessing global memory.
