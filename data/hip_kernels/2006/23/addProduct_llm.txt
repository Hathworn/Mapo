```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to benefit from memory bandwidth
// Consider using shared memory if there are reusable data segments
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Attempt to maximize occupancy by choosing optimal block and grid sizes
// Avoid using atomic operations unless necessary to prevent performance degradation
// Schedule computations to hide memory latency
```
