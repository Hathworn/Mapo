```
// Use shared memory to cache num_erased values for faster access
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations in out_lod0 and in_lod
// Minimize memory latency by accessing num_erased and in_lod with a stride pattern
// Use warp-synchronous programming for better utilization of the GPU's memory hierarchy
