```
// Consider optimizing memory access by using shared memory for gradOutput_data within each block.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for input and output pointers to help the compiler optimize memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations where possible.
// Fuse kernels if possible to reduce overall memory traffic.
// Limit the use of scalar variables in favor of warp shuffle operations.
