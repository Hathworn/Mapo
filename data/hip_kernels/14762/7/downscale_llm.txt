```
// Consider coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results if there are reused computations
// Avoid repeated division in translate_idx_inv by storing results in temporary variables
// Optimize loop order to maximize warps and reduce execution divergence
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput if the loop count is fixed
// Prefetch data into shared memory to overlap computation with memory access
// Ensure data alignment to achieve half-warp memory transactions
// Analyze the use of banked shared memory to avoid bank conflicts
