// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Optimize index calculations to minimize arithmetic operations within the kernel.
// Ensure the indices array is read in a coalesced manner if possible.
