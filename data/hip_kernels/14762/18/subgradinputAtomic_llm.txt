```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for gradOutput and gradInput
// Optimize memory access pattern for better cache performance
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Unroll loops to reduce loop overhead and increase throughput
// Evaluate using half precision for computations if accuracy allows
// Consider launching more threads to keep the GPU more utilized
// Minimize use of atomic operations if possible
// Explore warp-level primitives to optimize atomic operations
