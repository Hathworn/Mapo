// Use shared memory to optimize memory access patterns.
// Initialize shared memory buffer at the start.
// Use synchronized threads to efficiently aggregate results.
// Optimize memory access within for loop by using step increments.
// Perform reduction in the first thread to minimize global memory accesses.
// Consider using atomic operations to safely update global memory from multiple threads.
