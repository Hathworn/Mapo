```
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory if possible
// Balance workload evenly among threads
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations
// Avoid thread divergence by ensuring uniform control flow
```
