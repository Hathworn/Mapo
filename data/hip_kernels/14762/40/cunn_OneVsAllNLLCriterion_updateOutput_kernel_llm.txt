```c
// Use coalesced memory access for input and target arrays
// Consider using vectorized loads where possible
// Ensure positiveWeight array is in constant memory if it doesn't change across iterations
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory buffer
// Ensure enough threads to fully utilize the block for the parallel reduction
// Pre-warm input data into L1 cache if possible
```
