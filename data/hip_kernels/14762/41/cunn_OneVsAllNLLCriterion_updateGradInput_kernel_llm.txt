```
// Use shared memory where possible to reduce global memory access.
// Consider loop unrolling for better memory throughput.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous access patterns.
// Use appropriate memory access pattern to maximize warp efficiency.
// Reduce divergent branching in calculations for better performance.
// Profile memory usage to find bottlenecks for further optimization.
