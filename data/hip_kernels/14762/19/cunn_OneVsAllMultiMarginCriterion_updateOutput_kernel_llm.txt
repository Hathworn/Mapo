```
// Consider using shared memory efficiently to reduce global memory accesses.
// Precompute factors that are used frequently to minimize redundant calculations.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for better memory throughput.
// Employ loop unrolling for performance improvement in reduction operations.
// Implement warp-level primitives for reduction to avoid divergence.
// Evaluate the potential benefits of using half-precision operations if applicable.
