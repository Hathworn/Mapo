```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for commonly used data.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring global memory accesses are contiguous.
// Consider loop unrolling for the kW and kH loops to reduce loop overhead.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointer arguments to improve compiler optimizations.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory access latency.
