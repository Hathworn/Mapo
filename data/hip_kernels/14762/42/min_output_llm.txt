```c
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning input and output memory
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory traffic if suitable
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop
// Ensure memory transactions are coalesced and aligned
// Improve data locality to increase cache efficiency
```
