```
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance on repeated operations
// Profile atomic operations for contention and modify access patterns if needed
// Double-check bounds checking to avoid redundant calculations
// Utilize asynchronous memory copies for better data transfer efficiency
