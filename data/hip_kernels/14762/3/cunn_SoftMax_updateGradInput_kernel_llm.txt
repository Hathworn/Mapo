```
// Consider coalesced memory access for gradInput, output, and gradOutput to improve performance
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access latency
// Optimize thread utilization to ensure maximum occupancy and efficient computation of sums
// Implement memory alignment strategies for global loads and stores to enhance bandwidth utilization
// Leverage warp shuffle operations where applicable to reduce dependence on shared memory
