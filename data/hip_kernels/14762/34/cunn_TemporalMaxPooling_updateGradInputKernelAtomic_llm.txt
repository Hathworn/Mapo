```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to optimize global memory read/write
// Use shared memory if possible to further reduce global memory access
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient intra-thread communication
// Minimize the use of atomic operations if feasible or explore atomic optimizations
// Unroll loops if loop bounds are known at compile-time
