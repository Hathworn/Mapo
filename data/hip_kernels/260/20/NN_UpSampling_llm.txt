```
// Consider coalescing memory access patterns for 'target' and 'source' arrays
// Use shared memory if beneficial to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure warp efficiency by aligning block size to warp size
// Precompute repeated expressions (e.g., division) to reduce arithmetic operations
// Ensure memory load/store operations are aligned to increase throughput
