```
// Optimize memory access patterns for f_dimX and f_dimY by ensuring coalesced access
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed variables like centerX and centerY to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce the number of iterations and improve kernel performance
