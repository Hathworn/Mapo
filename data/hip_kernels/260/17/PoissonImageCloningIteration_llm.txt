```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve data locality.
// Combine multiple if-check conditions to minimize branching and enhance memory coherence.
// Prefetch neighboring data elements once to avoid redundant global memory fetches.
// Perform computations using local variables to reduce global memory pressure.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to potentially reduce bandwidth and improve cache utilization.
