```
// Use shared memory to cache forest data and reduce global memory access.
// Ensure proper synchronization using __syncthreads() after loading data into shared memory.
// Consider adjusting thread block size to optimize shared memory usage and avoid bank conflicts.
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing loaded data in shared memory for calculations.
