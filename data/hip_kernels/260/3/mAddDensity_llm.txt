```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for global memory reads
// Ensure block size matches the warp size for optimal performance
// Avoid unnecessary use of __syncthreads when not required
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize bank conflicts
// Optimize the block and grid size based on the GPU architecture
