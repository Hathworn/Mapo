```
// Consider using shared memory to cache portions of the source data to improve memory access times.
// Optimize warp execution by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Experiment with different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for hardware.
// Reduce global memory accesses by loading necessary data into local variables when possible.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use memory prefetching techniques to hide latency.
