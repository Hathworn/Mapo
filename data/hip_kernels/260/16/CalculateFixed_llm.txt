```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses in structure of arrays (SoA) fashion
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Minimize bank conflicts by accessing shared memory in a way that avoids overlap among threads
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of loop control and increase instruction throughput
// Utilize constant memory for constants or readonly data accessed by multiple threads
// Optimize grid and block size for maximum occupancy and performance efficiency
