```
// Consider using shared memory to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures appropriately
// Reduce global memory traffic by minimizing unnecessary reads/writes
// Evaluate the potential benefit of using vectorized data types
// Use constant memory for small data to improve access speed
// Optimize thread divergence by ensuring uniform control flow
