```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data if possible
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Minimize divergent execution by ensuring warp coherence
// Optimize memory access by accessing aligned memory when possible
// Evaluate loop unrolling for repetitive operations within threads
// Ensure data types used are optimal for the architecture to reduce latency
// Review memory bank conflicts in shared memory to optimize access
