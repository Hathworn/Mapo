```cpp
// Ensure coalesced access by having threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory for better memory access patterns.
// Optimize the use of registers by keeping frequently accessed variables in registers.
// Reduce divergent branches to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Explore using texture memory for possibly improved read access.
