```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_Data.
// Use vectorized data types, like float4, for better memory throughput.
// Utilize more shared memory for risk of exceeding 128 threads per block.
// Try loop unrolling in reduction to decrease overhead.
// Employ warp shuffle instructions for efficient reduction.
// Prefetch data into shared memory to hide memory latency.
// Avoid using atomic operations if not necessary as they are expensive.
// Optimize stride-based reduction to use warp-level primitives.
