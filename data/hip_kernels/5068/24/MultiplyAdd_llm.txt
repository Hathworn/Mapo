```cpp
// Consider implementing memory coalescing to improve global memory access patterns.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure data alignment for optimal memory transactions.
// Analyze if using texture or constant memory is beneficial for read-only data like d_ConstantA and d_ConstantB.
