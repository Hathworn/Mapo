```
// Optimize memory coalescing to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize data transfer between global and local memory.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses for optimal performance.
// Replace magic numbers with constants for better code readability and maintainability.
// Consider loop unrolling to potentially decrease overall execution time.
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations across threads.
