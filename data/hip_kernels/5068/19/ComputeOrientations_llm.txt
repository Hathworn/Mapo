```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory efficiently to reduce redundant global memory accesses and improve data reuse.
// Optimize the balance between shared memory usage and concurrency to find the optimal performance point.
// Ensure proper synchronization to prevent race conditions when using shared memory or atomic operations.
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns to improve memory access efficiency.
// Explore different block sizes to find the optimal configuration for memory and compute operations.
// Consider adjusting the grid configuration to better align with the data size and access patterns.
