```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for frequently accessed data.
// Optimize memory coalescing by reorganizing data structures for more efficient memory access patterns.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by adjusting block and thread dimensions for optimal performance.
// Minimize divergence within threads and warp by restructuring conditional statements.
// Reuse loaded variables within a block to reduce unnecessary global memory reads.
