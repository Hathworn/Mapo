```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data column-wise
// Load data to shared memory in a single loop for better utilization
// Minimize thread divergence by having each thread access consecutive memory locations
// Balance loads across warp by ensuring even distribution of iterations amongst threads
// Avoid bank conflicts by accessing shared memory in a strided manner
// Ensure synchronization after loading data to shared memory
// Limit condition checks inside loops to reduce branch divergence
