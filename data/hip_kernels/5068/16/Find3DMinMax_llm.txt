```
// Reduce global memory accesses by using shared memory effectively.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory.
// Minimize redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in shared memory.
// Optimize loop computations to reduce divergence and enhance parallelism.
// Consider possibilities for loop unrolling for constant iteration counts.
// Avoid thread conflicts by ensuring unique global memory writing.
