// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for improved performance.
// Review the order of shared memory loads to potentially minimize bank conflicts.
// Evaluate potential use of texture memory for readonly data like kernel or input data for better cache utilization.
// Analyze kernel execution configuration to ensure optimal occupancy and resource utilization.
