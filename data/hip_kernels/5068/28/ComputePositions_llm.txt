```
// Use registers instead of shared memory for faster access speeds.
// Reduce global memory accesses by using temporary variables.
// Load repeated data into registers to minimize global reads.
// Simplify index calculations to reduce arithmetic overhead.
// Consider using texture memory if access patterns are random.
