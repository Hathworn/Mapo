// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data accesses across threads.
// Check if memory access patterns can be optimized for better cache utilization.
// Evaluate the use of registers to store frequently accessed data.
// If possible, minimize the stride in memory access for improved performance.
