```
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for d_Data1 and d_Data2
// Ensure that d_Result is written to efficiently to avoid bank conflicts
// Utilize memory access patterns that maximize memory throughput
// Evaluate potential benefits of using shared memory for intermediate steps
// Merge conditional logic to minimize branch divergence among threads
