```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory usage
// Initialize shared memory arrays to avoid repetitive calculations
// Precompute Gaussian weights and store them in shared memory
// Load only valid pixel data into shared memory to avoid out-of-bound accesses
// Ensure threads have a coalesced access pattern to global memory
// Optimize histogram reduction using fewer synchronization points
// Employ boundary checks to minimize conditional branch divergence
// Use warp-level synchronization where possible for efficiency
