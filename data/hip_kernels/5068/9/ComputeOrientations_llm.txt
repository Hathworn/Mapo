// Consider using coalesced memory access for loading data into shared memory.
// Use a loop unrolling technique to improve the efficiency of histogram initialization.
// Evaluate if asynchronous memory copy could reduce wait times during synchronization.
// Investigate using fewer synchronization points, potentially by rearranging data operations.
// Use shared memory efficiently by ensuring the memory layout reduces bank conflicts.
// Reevaluate constant memory use or shared memory overlaps for frequently accessed values like `gauss`.
