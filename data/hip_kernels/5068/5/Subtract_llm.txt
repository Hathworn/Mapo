```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by having contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations
// Consider using shared memory if neighboring elements are accessed frequently
// Align memory accesses to 128-byte boundaries for better performance
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
// Check the pitch alignment to reduce memory access latency
// Use 32x32 thread blocks if hardware supports for better warp efficiency
