```
// Consider memory coalescing by accessing memory in a linear and sequential manner
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Apply loop unrolling for both inner and outer loops to enhance performance
// Pre-compute repeated expressions to minimize computation overhead
// Consider using texture memory for input if spatial locality is high
// Minimize thread divergence in conditional statements by restructuring logic
```
