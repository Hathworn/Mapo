// Use shared memory for mean accumulation to reduce global memory access
// Implement loop unrolling for the accumulation loop to improve performance
// Consider using warp-level reduction for faster mean calculation
// Optimize memory access patterns to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Experiment with different block sizes to achieve better occupancy
