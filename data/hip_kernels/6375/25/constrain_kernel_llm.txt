// Use shared memory for repeated ALPHA accesses  
// Ensure coalesced memory access by proper alignment of X  
// Optimize thread block size to improve occupancy  
// Consider using atomic operations if concurrent updates occur  
// Profile memory bandwidth usage to identify bottlenecks  
// Experiment with different memory access patterns for best performance
