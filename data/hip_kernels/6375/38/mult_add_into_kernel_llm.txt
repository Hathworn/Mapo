```c
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize global memory accesses by loading into registers
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance
// Adjust block size for optimal occupancy
// Balance the number of threads and blocks for optimal performance
