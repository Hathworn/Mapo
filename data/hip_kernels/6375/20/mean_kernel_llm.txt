```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns by aligning spatial elements across contiguous memory
// Minimize global memory accesses by using shared memory to accumulate partial sums
// Ensure shared memory size does not exceed the per-block limit for efficient usage
// Optimize memory access by ensuring alignment and coalescence of index calculations
// Consider using atomic operations for reduction if applicable to support larger block dimensions
