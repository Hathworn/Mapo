```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced global memory stores  
// Reduce shared memory bank conflicts if shared memory is used
// Merge thread index computations to minimize redundant operations
// Unroll the loop further for better performance on larger INCX values
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to improve compiler optimization
// Use warp-synchronous programming if applicable to avoid thread divergence
