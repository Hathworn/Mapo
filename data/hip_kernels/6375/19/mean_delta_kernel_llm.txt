```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for sum calculation to reduce global memory access
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Ensure alignment of memory access to improve global memory throughput
```
