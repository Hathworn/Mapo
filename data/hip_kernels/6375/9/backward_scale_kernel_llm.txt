```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring data is coalesced
// Utilize shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider increasing block size to improve reduction efficiency
// Ensure alignment of data for optimal memory access performance
// Use atomic operations judiciously to prevent performance bottlenecks due to contention
