```
// Consider using shared memory to cache the delta values for better memory access patterns
// Optimize the loop with loop unrolling for both 'l' and 'm' for enhanced performance
// Use the restrict keyword on pointer arguments to assist the compiler with optimization
// Align memory accesses to 128/256-bit boundaries for improved coalesced memory access
// Minimize conditional checks inside loops to potentially increase throughput
