```
// Consider using shared memory to cache repeated mask[i] accesses for better memory coalescing.
// Ensure that the grid and block size are chosen to maximize occupancy and fully utilize GPU resources.
// Perform alignment checks and ensure pointer addresses are aligned to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize conditional branches in the kernel to prevent divergent warps and improve performance.
// Analyze and experiment with loop unroll pragmas for optimizing loop execution within the kernel.
