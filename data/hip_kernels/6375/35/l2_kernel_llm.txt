```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning truth, pred, delta, and error arrays properly
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if possible
// Consider loop unrolling for improved performance if workload allows
// Optimize the block and grid dimensions for better occupancy and memory throughput
// Minimize divergence within warps by handling boundary conditions more efficiently
