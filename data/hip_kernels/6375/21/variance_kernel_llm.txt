```
// Precompute scale factor to avoid redundant calculations
// Utilize 1D grid for improved scheduling and resource management
// Ensure early exit for threads exceeding filter range
// Leverage registers for reduction operations to minimize memory access
// Minimize repeated computation by calculating differences once
// Perform local accumulation to reduce global memory transactions
