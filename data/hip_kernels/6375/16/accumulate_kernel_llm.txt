// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for better cache utilization
// Optimize loop unrolling further based on hardware capabilities for optimal performance
// Consider using atomic operations if multiple threads write to the same output location
// Align data structures for coalesced access to improve memory bandwidth usage
