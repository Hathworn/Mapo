```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring thread-based access within contiguous memory regions.
// Try to minimize global memory accesses by maximizing shared memory utilization.
// Ensure all threads within a warp are active to prevent divergence and maximize efficiency.
// Explore further reduction in registers by optimizing local variables.
// If possible, experiment with alternative memory layouts for better performance.
// Eliminate bank conflicts in shared memory through optimized index calculations.
// Attempt to unroll loops for reduced overhead and increased throughput.
// Analyze if more warps per block or block adjustments might lead to better resource utilization.
