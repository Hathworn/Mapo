// Consider optimizing the loop to avoid atomic operations for larger arrays in shared memory.
// Use warp-level primitives to perform reduction operations to minimize thread divergence.
// Double-check shared memory usage to ensure it doesn't exceed the available limit per block.
// Implement cooperative groups or warp shuffle to optimize reduction within a block.
