// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better performance
// Optimize memory alignment for float arrays to reduce misalignment penalties
// Explore shared memory usage to minimize global memory accesses
// Evaluate the use of constant memory for frequently accessed variables like 'prob' and 'scale'
