```
// Consider coalesced memory access for 'x' and 'binary' to improve memory throughput
// Ensure 'x' and 'binary' arrays are aligned to facilitate efficient memory transactions
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring warp threads follow the same execution path
// Explore using shared memory to load chunks of 'x' if device memory bandwidth becomes a bottleneck
