```
// Consider merging multiple float loads into a float2 or float4 for coalesced memory access.
// Ensure that data_col is aligned on a float4 boundary for efficient memory writes.
// Precompute repeated terms to reduce arithmetic operations and increase performance.
// Optimize shared memory usage, if applicable, to alleviate global memory load.
// Optimize thread block size to improve memory access coalescing and occupancy.
