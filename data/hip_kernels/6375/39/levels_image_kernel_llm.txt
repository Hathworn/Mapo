```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access where possible.
// Consider coalescing memory access by improving the access pattern.
// Try loop unrolling to maximize throughput.
// Utilize __restrict__ to indicate non-aliasing pointers for the image array.
// Evaluate if reducing register pressure by reorganizing variable usage can improve performance.
// Ensure warp-level calculations to prevent thread divergence, especially in the switch-case.
