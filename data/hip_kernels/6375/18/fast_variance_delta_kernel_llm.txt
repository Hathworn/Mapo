```
// Use shared memory to temporarily store local contributions for each thread.
// Implement thread-stride loop to distribute workload evenly across threads.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'delta' and 'x' to improve bandwidth usage.
// Utilize reduction pattern to efficiently aggregate results in shared memory.
// Optimize reduction using loop unrolling techniques where possible.
// Favor low register pressure by minimizing variable usage within critical loops.
// Compute variance_delta in the first thread of each block to avoid warp divergence.
// Reduce memory access latency by maintaining spatial locality within each batch loop.
// Apply constant memory for frequently used values if applicable to boost cache efficiency.
// Consider loop fusion or array padding strategies to enhance memory access patterns.
