```
// Utilize shared memory to cache key data_col elements for faster access
// Use register variables for frequently accessed variables such as val
// Implement thread coarsening by handling multiple pixels per thread where applicable
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data_col to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Ensure memory access patterns are optimized for coalescing to maximize throughput
// Reduce warp divergence by ensuring uniform control flow across threads
