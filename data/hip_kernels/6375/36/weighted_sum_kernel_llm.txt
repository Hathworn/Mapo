```
// Combine loads of 'a[i]' and 's[i]' to reduce memory latency
// Use shared memory for 's' if its reuse is high to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling if 'n' is large to improve performance
// Ensure coalesced memory access for 'a', 'b', 's', and 'c' arrays
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize stalls
