```
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for each block to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads read consecutive data elements from input.
// Evaluate if using atomic operations would improve accuracy and performance when accumulating sums across threads.
// If applicable, apply loop unrolling to the for loop to minimize control overhead and maximize throughput.
// Balance blockDim.x and gridDim.x to optimize for target GPU and ensure the kernel is fully saturated.
