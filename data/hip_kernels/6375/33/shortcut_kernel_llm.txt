// Pre-compute common multiplications outside the index calculations to reduce redundant computations
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data structures
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access consecutive memory locations
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to improve memory bandwidth
