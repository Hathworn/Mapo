```
// Consider aligning memory accesses for x and mean arrays to reduce memory latency
// Use vectorized loads and stores to enhance memory throughput
// Optimize thread utilization by minimizing idle threads in the spatial loop
// Investigate using asynchronous copy with shared memory for better latency hiding
