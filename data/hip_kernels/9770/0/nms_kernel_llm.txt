```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading box data to shared memory.
// Employ loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead when copying data to shared memory.
// Consider using half precision if precision requirements allow it to save memory bandwidth.
// Optimize the use of shared memory by utilizing the smallest necessary data type.
// Employ warp-synchronous programming to avoid calling __syncthreads() too frequently.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by avoiding stride patterns that match the bank size.
// Use a divide-and-conquer technique to reduce comparisons in overlapping blocks.
