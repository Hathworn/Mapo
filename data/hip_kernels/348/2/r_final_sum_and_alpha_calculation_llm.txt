```
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Consider using a loop to handle cases when size > blockDim.x for loading data
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads participate in reduction
// Use volatile keyword if necessary to avoid compiler optimization issues with shared memory
// Align shared memory allocation to avoid bank conflicts
