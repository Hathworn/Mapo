// #pragma unroll  // Consider loop unrolling for improved parallel execution efficiency
// Initialize sum inside the inner loop to avoid unnecessary memory operations
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data to minimize global memory access
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory for optimal memory bandwidth usage
// Balance the workload across threads to avoid idle threads and improve latency
// Consider using warp-level synchronization for more efficient thread management
