```
// Consider optimizing memory coalescing for global memory access.
// Utilize shared memory to store rows or sections of matrix to minimize access latency.
// Reduce the number of redundant global memory accesses by introducing temporary variables.
// Ensure loop unrolling is applied where feasible to increase registers usage efficiency.
// Make use of constant memory for values that do not change during kernel execution.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for potential faster read access patterns.
