```
// Reuse shared memory allocations for multiple purposes within the same block to reduce memory footprint.
// Ensure proper memory alignment and coalesced access for the global memory reads of array a and b.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to improve performance.
// Optimize block size and minimize thread divergence by configuring blockDim.x according to hardware characteristics.
// Preload values from global memory into registers before computation to decrease memory latency.
