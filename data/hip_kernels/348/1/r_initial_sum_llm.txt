```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for 'a' and 'r' to improve memory access patterns.
// Unrolling the loop might improve parallelism and reduce instruction overhead.
// Ensure 'index' calculations avoid bank conflicts by aligning with memory boundaries.
// Consider using a smaller shared memory size for better occupancy if possible.
// Optimize shared memory usage to prevent excessive bank conflicts.
// Minimize barriers such as __syncthreads() when possible by restructuring reduction logic.
