```
// Consider loading r_squared and p_sum into shared memory for faster access
// Ensure memory access coalescing by aligning data read/writes
// Minimize warp divergence by having warp threads execute the same operations
// Use const memory if r_squared and p_sum are read-only and constant across threads
