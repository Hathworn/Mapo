```
// Consider using shared memory for storing local_non_diagonal_values to reduce global memory access.
// Use loop unrolling for reducing the number of iterations and improving parallel efficiency.
// Consider using a different convergence criterion for quicker termination.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
