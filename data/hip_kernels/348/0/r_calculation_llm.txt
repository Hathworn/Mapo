```
// Use shared memory for storing intermediate values to improve memory access speed
// Unrolling the loop to reduce overhead and increase parallel execution
// Consider further reducing global memory accesses by ensuring data locality
// Use coalesced global memory access patterns when reading/writing with 'a', 'b', and 'x'
