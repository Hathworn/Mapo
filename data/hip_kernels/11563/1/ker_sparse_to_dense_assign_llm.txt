```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize thread divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
// Use proper data alignment to enable faster memory access
// Utilize loop unrolling techniques if beneficial to increase parallel execution
