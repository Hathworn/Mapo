```
// Consider coalescing global memory access for idx to reduce memory transactions.
// Explore the use of vectorized data types for src and trg to maximize bandwidth.
// Investigate using warp shuffle operations to reduce shared memory use and synchronization.
// Ensure loop unrolling for the atomic addition loop to improve performance.
// Profile kernel execution to identify further potential bottlenecks with memory access patterns.
