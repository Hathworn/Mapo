// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access for block-specific calculations.
// Use vectorized memory operations if applicable to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to fit the GPU architecture for better warp execution efficiency.
// Investigate coalesced memory access patterns for the idx array to reduce memory latency.
