```
// Use shared memory to cache gradOutput_data values and reduce global memory accesses.
// Try to coalesce memory accesses to gradInput_data to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure the loop unrolling factor matches the common hardware warp size for better ILP and efficiency.
// Consider using vectorized memory operations to optimize throughput and reduce latency.
// Balance the number of threads per block to optimize occupancy and utilize more CUDA cores.
