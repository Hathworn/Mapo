// Utilize coalesced memory access for arrays a and b
// Use loop unrolling techniques for sum calculation
// Optimize shared memory allocation if block size is known
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reduction instead of shared memory
// Ensure number of threads per block is optimized for hardware capabilities
