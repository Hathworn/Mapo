// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to achieve optimal performance.
// Explore loop unrolling to decrease loop overhead and improve parallelism.
