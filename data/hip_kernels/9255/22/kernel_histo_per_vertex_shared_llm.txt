// Use coalesced memory access patterns for reading from `ct`.
// Minimize the use of atomic operations to reduce contention.
// Consider increasing the temporal locality by reordering operations.
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently utilized to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize data placement in shared memory to maximize bank conflict reduction.
