```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth.
// Restructure data layout for better memory access patterns.
// Align data access to warp size to minimize memory divergence.
// Use const memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can improve performance within the while loop.
// Explore using threadfence before atomicAdd if data consistency is an issue.
