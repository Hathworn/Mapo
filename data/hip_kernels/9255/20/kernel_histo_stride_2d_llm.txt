```
// Consider using shared memory for partial histograms to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access when reading from ct to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use warp-level primitives to minimize thread divergence and improve parallel efficiency.
// Optimize the stride calculation to align data access patterns with device memory architecture.
