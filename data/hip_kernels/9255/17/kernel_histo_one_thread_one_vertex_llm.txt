```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory if used in further optimizations.
// Ensure that the atomicAdd operations do not become a bottleneck.
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop for better warp efficiency.
// Consider using shared memory to stage data if possible.
// Evaluate the impact of launching more threads per block to utilize device resources better.
