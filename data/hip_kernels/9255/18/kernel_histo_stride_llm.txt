// Utilize shared memory to minimize access latency and increase throughput.
// Avoid excessive use of global memory by utilizing shared memory as a buffer.
// Ensure memory coalescing by structuring access patterns that align with warp boundaries.
// Reduce the number of atomic operations on global memory by performing them in shared memory first.
// Prioritize warp-level optimizations to hide memory latency and maximize efficiency.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and balance the workload evenly across threads.
