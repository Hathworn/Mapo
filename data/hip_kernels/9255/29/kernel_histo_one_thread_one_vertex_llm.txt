// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns by aligning data structures to warp size.
// Use coalesced memory accesses for efficient data retrieval.
// Employ loop unrolling to potentially enhance performance further in critical sections.
// Ensure that atomic operations do not lead to excessive serialization; analyze if atomic needs optimization or alternative handling.
