```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize memory access within warps
// Minimize the use of atomic operations if possible
// Consider occupancy tuning by adjusting block size and grid size
