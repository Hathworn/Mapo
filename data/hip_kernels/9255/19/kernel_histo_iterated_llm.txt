```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Initialize shared memory outside of the loop for efficiency
// Use atomic operations in shared memory to minimize contention
// Aggregate shared memory data in a single thread for efficient global memory update
// Avoid frequent global memory accesses by using a single atomic operation per block
```
