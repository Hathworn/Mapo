```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced access patterns in global memory reads
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Reduce the number of atomic operations by aggregating data in shared memory before writing back to global memory
// Consider using warp-level primitives to reduce bank conflicts and improve parallel reduction within shared memory
