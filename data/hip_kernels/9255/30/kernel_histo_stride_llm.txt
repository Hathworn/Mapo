// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve data locality.
// Consider using warp shuffle functions for better intra-warp communication.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures and access patterns appropriately.
// Optimize stride to match memory fetch size for efficient memory bandwidth utilization.
// Minimize divergent branching to reduce warp serialization.
