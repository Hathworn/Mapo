```c
// Use coalesced memory accesses for both 'ct' and 'histo' to improve memory bandwidth.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like 'histo'.
// Minimize divergent branches to ensure efficient warping.
// Ensure all data is aligned properly for optimal memory performance.
// Analyze occupancy and adjust block size to fully utilize GPU resources.
