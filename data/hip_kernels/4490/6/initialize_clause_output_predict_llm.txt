```c
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if possible
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns to improve data throughput
// Minimize use of shared variables to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Use warp-level primitives to further reduce branch divergence within warps
// Optimize block and grid sizes for maximum occupancy and efficiency
