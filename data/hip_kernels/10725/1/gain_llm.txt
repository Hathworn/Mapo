```c
// Consider using shared memory to store input tile for coalesced access
// Load color components into registers to minimize global memory access
// Reduce arithmetic operations by pre-calculating gains
// Analyze the need for __syncthreads() when using shared memory
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for both input and output
