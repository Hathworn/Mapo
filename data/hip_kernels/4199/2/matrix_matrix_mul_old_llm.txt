```
// Consider using shared memory for tiles of matrices to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns by coalescing reads/writes
// Ensure proper memory alignment for better performance
// Minimize thread divergence within warps
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal occupancy and performance
