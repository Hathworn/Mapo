```cpp
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed values to reduce global memory access
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data to improve cache hits
// Rearrange data access patterns for coalesced memory access
// Minimize divergent branching within warp by restructuring control flow
// Precompute constant expressions outside of loops to save computation time
// Perform loop unrolling for known loop bounds to improve performance
