// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data, such as histJ and cumJ.
// Minimize divergent branching by reorganizing conditions.
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations within the loop.
// Investigate if loop unrolling could improve performance for the binary search.
// Align data structures to reduce overhead on memory transfers.
// Explore the possibility of using texture memory for read-only data like histJ and cumJ.
// Ensure that data types are optimized for memory access, potentially using half precision where appropriate.
