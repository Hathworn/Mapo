```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning thread operations with data layout
// Consider utilizing texture memory for read-only data like corrAB to improve bandwidth
// Use shared memory efficiently to store frequent data temporally for faster access
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper indexing patterns
// Minimize atomic operations in favor of shared reductions or other strategies
