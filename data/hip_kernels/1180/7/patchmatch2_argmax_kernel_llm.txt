```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data such as 'conv' values.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses in 'prev_corrAB_upsampled' and 'corrAB'.
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead in the nested 'for' loops.
// Assess the impact of reducing register usage by optimizing variable scopes.
// Evaluate if texture memory could be beneficial for accessing 'conv' values.
