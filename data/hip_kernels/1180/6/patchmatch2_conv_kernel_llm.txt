```cpp
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data from global memory.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead within kernel computations.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalesced reads/writes.
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel to improve warp efficiency.
// Use constant memory for kernel arguments that do not change across threads such as 's_size' or 'patch'.
