```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Load global memory into sharedBP[] using coalesced access
// Ensure indexing within bounds when using shared memory
// Apply __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions in shared memory
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Avoid excessive synchronization by limiting __syncthreads() usage
