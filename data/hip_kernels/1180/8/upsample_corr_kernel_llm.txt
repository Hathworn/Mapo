```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for accessing curr_corr to reduce global memory latency.
// Use texture memory if access patterns are mostly 2D and exhibit spatial locality.
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword on curr_corr and next_corr pointers for potential compiler optimization.
// Utilize loop unrolling for tighter performance if the number of iterations is small and predictable. 
// Align memory access to warp boundaries to optimize performance and avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure block size TB is a multiple of warp size for best occupancy.
