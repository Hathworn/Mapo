```c
// Use shared memory to cache A and reduce global memory accesses
// Use texture memory for corrAB to benefit from cached reads
// Ensure coalesced memory access for writing to B
// Consider unrolling inner loops to improve performance
// Optimize the condition checks to reduce branch divergence
// Align memory allocations for A and B for better efficiency
