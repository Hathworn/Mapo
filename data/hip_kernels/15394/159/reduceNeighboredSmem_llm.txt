```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory transactions.
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory access latency.
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring aligned access patterns.
// Load data into shared memory to reduce repeated global memory access.
// Perform in-place operations using shared memory to leverage faster access speeds.
// Synchronize threads appropriately when accessing shared memory to avoid data hazards.
