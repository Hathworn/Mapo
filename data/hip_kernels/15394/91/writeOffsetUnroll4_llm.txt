```
// Use loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by aligning thread data access
// Minimize global memory access by loading data into registers when possible
// Consider increasing block size for better GPU occupancy if resources allow
// Avoid divergent branches within the loop to maintain warp efficiency
