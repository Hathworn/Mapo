// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Check if loop unrolling could increase computational efficiency
// Evaluate if data prefetching can be implemented for better memory throughput
// Assess the impact of using __restrict__ pointers to optimize data access
