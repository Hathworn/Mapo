```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring src and dst are accessed sequentially.
// Align src and dst arrays in memory to improve access speed.
// Ensure grid configuration maximizes occupancy without exceeding resource limits.
// Use memory prefetching if applicable to reduce fetch latency.
