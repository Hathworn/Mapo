// Use shared memory to improve memory access patterns and reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced by carefully aligning addresses in shared memory storage
// Optimize thread block dimensions to balance between warp occupancy and memory access coalescing
// Consider using additional synchronization or memory barriers if extending the tile size beyond current setup
