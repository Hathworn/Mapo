```
// Opt for coalesced memory access by ensuring contiguous memory locations are read by adjacent threads
// Reduce bank conflicts by proper alignment of shared memory access
// Consider increasing the block size for better utilization of the GPU resources
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring warp threads follow same execution path
// Possible use of double buffering technique to hide latency of global memory accesses
// Evaluate using async compute to overlap memory transfer and computation
