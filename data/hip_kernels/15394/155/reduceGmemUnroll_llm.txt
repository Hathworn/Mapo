```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifier for g_idata and g_odata to enable compiler optimizations.
// Minimize global memory accesses by ensuring all threads within a warp are coalesced when accessing g_idata.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for reduced memory latency.
// Employ further unrolling techniques inside the warp if performance allows.
// Consider the usage of __syncthreads() carefully to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
