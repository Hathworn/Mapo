```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for A, B, and C to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory bandwidth.
// Align data structures or memory accesses to 128 or 256 bytes to benefit from hardware coalescing.
// Use loop unrolling techniques further for larger unroll factors, inspecting performance impact.
// Optimize thread mapping to avoid bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Profile and check for warp divergence which may occur due to conditional statements.
