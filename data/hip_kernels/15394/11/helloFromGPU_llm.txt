// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
// Profile memory access patterns to identify potential coalescing issues
// Use __restrict__ keyword in pointer declarations to aid compiler optimization
