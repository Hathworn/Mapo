// Consider using shared memory for initial data load to reduce global memory accesses.
// Avoid unaligned memory access by ensuring g_idata[idx] and g_idata[idx + blockDim.x] are within bounds.
// Use loop unrolling techniques for further optimization of reduction in shared memory.
// Watch for warp divergence when using conditional statements within threads.
