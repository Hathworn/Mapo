// Consider using shared memory for intermediate results to minimize global memory access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access.
// Explore the possibility of using vectorized operations to improve throughput.
// Ensure that memory accesses are aligned to avoid unnecessary additional cycles.
// Experiment with loop unrolling combined with memory access optimizations for efficiency.
// Evaluate the use of atomic operations on global memory to ensure data consistency.
