// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses by storing intermediate values.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and memory allocations.
// Consider using loop unrolling for improved performance with predictable branching.
// Implement memory access patterns that minimize bank conflicts in shared memory.
