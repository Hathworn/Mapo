```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring that threads access contiguous memory locations
// Ensure that memory access is aligned to prevent memory bank conflicts
// Use shared memory to further optimize memory access if possible
// Consider loop unrolling to increase instruction level parallelism
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory access latency
```
