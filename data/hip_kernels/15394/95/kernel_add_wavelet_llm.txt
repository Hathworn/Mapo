```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize memory bandwidth
// Use shared memory if multiple threads need the same wavelet data
// Minimize the number of divergent branches within a warp
// Ensure data alignment to improve global memory access speed
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for repetitive operations
```
