// Optimize memory access by using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Unroll loops to reduce the overhead of loop control and improve instruction-level parallelism.
// Use warp-level reduction operations to minimize synchronization overhead.
