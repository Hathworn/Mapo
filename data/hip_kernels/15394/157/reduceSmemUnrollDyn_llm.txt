```
// Ensure coalesced access patterns by using contiguous global memory access.
// Utilize loop unrolling to reduce the overhead of loop control.
// Store thread-local sums in shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Employ shared memory for in-place reduction to speed up data exchange between threads.
// Optimize shared memory reduction by handling entire warps at a time.
// Use volatile keyword for synchronization purposes to prevent compiler optimizations from removing necessary memory accesses.
// Minimize thread divergence within warp-based reduction for efficiency.
