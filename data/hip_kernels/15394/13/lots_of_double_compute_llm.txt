```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for inputs and outputs to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory if there's a pattern in memory access that can benefit from caching.
// Ensure occupancy is optimized by choosing appropriate block size and grid size.
// Check if loop unrolling within the niters loop can increase performance.
// Profile and adjust the use of double precision if not necessary for accuracy requirements.
