```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for data frequently accessed by threads
// Align memory access patterns to exploit coalesced memory access
// Use memory prefetching to hide latency from global memory access
// Investigate if using warp-level primitives can optimize reductions or broadcasts
// Evaluate if reducing precision beyond half can provide performance benefits
```
