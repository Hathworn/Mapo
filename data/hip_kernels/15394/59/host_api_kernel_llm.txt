```
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Prefetch global memory data into registers to minimize latency
// Ensure memory access is coalesced for better performance
// Consider using __restrict__ to guide compiler optimizations
// Optimize thread block size to match GPU architecture for better occupancy
