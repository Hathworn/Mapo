// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load data in contiguous memory blocks for better coalescing
// Synchronize threads after shared memory load to ensure data consistency
// Use shared memory for computation to minimize redundant global accesses
// Synchronize threads after computation to prepare for next data load
