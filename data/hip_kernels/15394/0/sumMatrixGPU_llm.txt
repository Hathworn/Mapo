```
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory for frequently reused data to reduce global memory access.
// Align data structures in memory to minimize misaligned memory accesses.
// Evaluate occupancy to ensure full use of GPU resources.
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for additional performance gain.
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for full warp utilization.
