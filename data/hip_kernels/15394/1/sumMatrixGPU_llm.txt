```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring sequential threads access sequential memory locations
// Optimize block and grid size to improve occupancy and memory throughput
// Consider loop unrolling for further performance enhancement if the operation is repeated
