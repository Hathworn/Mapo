```
// Use shared memory for better memory access patterns and to reduce global memory traffic
// Consider coalesced access patterns for input_values to improve memory throughput
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
// Use warp-level primitives if available for faster reduction within warps
// Consider increasing blockDim.x to utilize full occupancy and memory bandwidth
