// Consider using shared memory to temporarily store input tile for reduced global memory access
// Use memory coalescing techniques to improve global memory access efficiency
// Minimize the number of memory transactions by ensuring threads access contiguous memory addresses
// Utilize warp-centric programming to optimize memory bandwidth utilization
// Explore the use of vectorized loads and stores for better memory operation throughput
