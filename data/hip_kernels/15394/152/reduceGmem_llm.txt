```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced access to global memory by aligning data structures.
// Implement loop unrolling more efficiently to minimize warp divergence.
// Apply thread synchronization only when necessary to reduce overhead.
// Optimize usage of registers to improve performance within warp.
