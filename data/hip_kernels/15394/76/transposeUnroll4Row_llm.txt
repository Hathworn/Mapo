```
// Use shared memory to store parts of the matrix for coalesced access
// Unroll the loop further if registers allow, to increase instruction throughput
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores (e.g., float4) for higher memory throughput
// Align data structures on 128-bit boundaries for optimal memory transactions
