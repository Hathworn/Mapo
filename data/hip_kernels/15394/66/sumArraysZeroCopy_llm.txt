```
// Ensure the arrays A, B, and C are aligned in memory for coalesced access
// Minimize the use of global memory by reusing data within the kernel when possible
// Consider increasing the thread block size to improve occupancy if the GPU supports it
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if there are no aliasing issues
// Prefetch data to shared memory if the kernel becomes more complex with additional operations
// Utilize vectorized memory operations for higher throughput if applicable
