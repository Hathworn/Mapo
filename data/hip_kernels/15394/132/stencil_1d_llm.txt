```
// Consider using memory coalescing to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.
// Avoid out-of-bound memory accesses to prevent undefined behavior.
// Utilize __syncthreads() to synchronize threads within the block after loading shared memory.
// Enable loop unrolling for better performance by reducing loop overhead.
