```
// Optimize the data fetching from global memory by using coalesced access patterns.
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency and bandwidth.
// Unroll loops in the reduction phase to enhance performance and reduce instruction overhead.
// Minimize synchronization overhead by using warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync.
// Use volatile keyword selectively to prevent compiler optimizations which might cause stalls.
