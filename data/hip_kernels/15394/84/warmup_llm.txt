// Use coalesced memory access for A and B arrays to enhance memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed values of A and B
// Optimize for memory alignment to reduce memory access latency
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
