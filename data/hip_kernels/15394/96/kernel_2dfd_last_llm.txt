```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access for stencil computation
// Ensure enough shared memory size to hold the data to prevent accessing out of bounds
// Preload values into registers to avoid repeated global memory reads
// Reduce redundant synchronization by carefully ordering memory accesses
// Unroll loops to enhance instruction level parallelism and reduce loop overhead
// Align memory access to improve memory coalescing and achieve higher bandwidth
// Minimize use of volatile to avoid performance penalties and incorrect optimizations
