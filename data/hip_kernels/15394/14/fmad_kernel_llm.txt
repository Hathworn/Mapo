// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if applicable
// Consider loop unrolling if multiple similar operations are happening
// Evaluate if warp shuffle can optimize data sharing across threads
// Minimize thread-independent calculations where possible
// Use register variables to hold frequently accessed data
