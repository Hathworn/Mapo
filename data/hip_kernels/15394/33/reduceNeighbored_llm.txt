```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data access patterns
// Minimize thread divergence by evenly distributing operations
// Avoid unnecessary synchronization for warp-synchronous code
// Utilize bank conflict-free memory access pattern in shared memory
```
