```
// Prefetch data into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous memory access patterns
// Implement loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Utilize volatile keyword for warp-level reductions to prevent register optimization issues
// Use __syncthreads() after each reduction step to maintain memory consistency across threads
