// Coalesce memory access by using a stride of blockDim.x to minimize memory transaction costs. 
// Utilize shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to improve throughput. 
// Minimize branch divergence by ensuring that all threads in a warp execute similar operations.
