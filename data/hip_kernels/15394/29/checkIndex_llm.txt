// Combine multiple printf outputs into one to minimize function call overhead
// Use shared memory if accessing data repeatedly to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
