```
// Consider using texture memory for repeated accesses of g_u2 elements to improve read efficiency.
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow similar execution paths.
// Optimize shared memory usage further by ensuring alignment and coalesced access patterns.
// Explore the use of `__ldg()` for read-only access of g_u2 elements to leverage hardware caching.
// Analyze using loop unrolling for the outer loop to enhance performance further.
// Ensure boundary checks minimize warp divergence and optimize conditions to avoid unnecessary checks.
// Evaluate the impact of using atomic operations if updates to g_u1 are contentious.
