```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve throughput
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp access sequential elements
// Implement memory padding if necessary to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider using warp-shuffle operations for further optimization
```
