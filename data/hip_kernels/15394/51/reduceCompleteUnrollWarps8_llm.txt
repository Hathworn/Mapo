```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access and improve performance.
// Use loop unrolling to decrease branch divergence and increase instruction throughput.
// Minimize memory access latency by ensuring coalesced memory access patterns.
// Use __syncthreads wisely to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Consider using atomic operations for concurrent writes to global memory if possible.
// Minimize usage of volatile keyword and ensure data consistency through appropriate synchronization.
