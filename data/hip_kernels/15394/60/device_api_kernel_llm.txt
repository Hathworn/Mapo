```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning tid and output memory access
// Avoid excessive hiprand_init calls by initializing localState only once per thread
// Unroll the loop to reduce loop overhead and improve ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency for temporary data
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize GPU occupancy
```
