```c
// Consider using shared memory for frequently used variables to minimize global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve performance.
// Minimize the number of printf calls to reduce kernel execution time.
// Utilize warp-level primitives for cooperative operations to optimize thread performance.
// Use constant memory for any invariant data across threads to speed up access times.
