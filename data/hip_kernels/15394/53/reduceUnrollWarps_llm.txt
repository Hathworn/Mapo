```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize bank conflicts when using shared memory
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Use volatile qualifier to prevent compiler optimization issues
// Avoid branch divergence by ensuring threads follow the same execution path
