```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced access to global memory.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for A, B, and C to help the compiler with potential optimizations.
// Ensure that the offset value does not lead to bank conflicts or memory divergence.
// Analyze if loop unrolling may improve performance depending on the workload characteristics.
