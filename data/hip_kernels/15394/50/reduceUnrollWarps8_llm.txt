```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Apply loop unrolling to optimize the memory access pattern
// Adhere to specific warp sizes to minimize synchronization
// Leverage volatile qualifier to ensure value coherency within warps
// Minimize global memory stores by combining results within blocks
