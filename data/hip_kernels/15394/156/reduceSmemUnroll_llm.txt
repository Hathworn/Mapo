// Consider optimizing shared memory bank conflicts by aligning data appropriately
// Ensure coalesced memory access for global memory reads
// Use loop unrolling for further memory access optimization
// Reduce the number of syncthreads for better performance
// Consider using atomics if race conditions are permitted
// Evaluate shared memory usage to prevent overuse
