```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory
// Use __builtin_assume to inform compiler about invariant conditions
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the specific GPU architecture
// Prefetch data into registers if possible
