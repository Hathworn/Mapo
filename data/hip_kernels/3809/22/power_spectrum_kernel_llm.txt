```
// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure shared memory data readiness.
// Use float2 to read complex number efficiently from global memory.
// Balance workload among threads by using loop with stride CU1DBLOCK.
// Handle special edge cases outside main parallel loop if necessary.
