// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to improve memory access efficiency
// Ensure memory alignment for d_input_cdf and d_output_cdf for coalesced access
// Use shared memory if there are repeated accesses to d_input_cdf to reduce global memory traffic
// Optimize thread and block dimensions for better occupancy and performance
