```cpp
// Optimize memory access by coalescing global memory reads and writes.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data like d_cdf_norm.
// Ensure to minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Prefetch data to registers to reduce global memory latency.
// Avoid redundant calculations by reusing computed values where possible.
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to further reduce runtime.
// Balance the workload across threads to avoid thread divergence.
