// Consider coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth usage
// Ensure d_bins is allocated in fast memory, e.g., shared memory, if possible
// Try to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory
// Explore using warp-level primitives for better warp utilization
// Profile and analyze memory access patterns for optimization areas
