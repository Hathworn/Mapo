```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve latency
// Optimize thread usage to maximize occupancy and resource utilization
// Use loop unrolling if applicable to reduce overhead and improve performance
// Ensure alignment of memory accesses to prevent bank conflicts
// Avoid divergence in warp execution to maintain parallel efficiency
