```
// Consider using shared memory to decrease the number of global memory accesses.
// Coalesce memory accesses by having threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Use texture memory for reading constants like template_half_height and template_half_width.
// Reduce warp divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path.
// Calculate image_index_1d without reversing the index to improve access patterns.
