// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_in to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to suggest compiler optimizations.
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used correctly to prevent race conditions.
// Experiment with loop unrolling inside the reduction loop for improved performance.
// Use warp shuffle operations for final thread-level reductions to maximize efficiency.
