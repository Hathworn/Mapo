```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Minimize thread divergence by keeping conditional blocks simple
// Use shared memory if multiple accesses are needed within warp
// Consider loop unrolling for repetitive operations
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for target architecture
