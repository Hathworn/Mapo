// Use shared memory to cache tile portions of matrices A and B to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for A and B by using proper indexing patterns.
// Consider loop unrolling in the accumulation loop to improve arithmetic computation efficiency.
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize GPU occupancy and parallel execution efficiency.
