```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for frequently accessed variables
// Precompute complex access patterns outside loops to minimize repeating work
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning and grouping data properly
// Optimize bank conflicts by organizing shared memory accesses efficiently
