// Use memory coalescing for accessing arrays a and b.
// Consider loop unrolling for the primary loop for performance gains.
// Ensure shmem is utilized efficiently to prevent bank conflicts.
// Use __syncthreads() judiciously to avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead.
// Consider deploying cooperative groups for more flexible grid synchronization.
