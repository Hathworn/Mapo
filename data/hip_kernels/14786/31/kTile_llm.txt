```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve caching
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning thread accesses to contiguous memory locations
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and minimize warp divergence
// Evaluate use of restrict keyword to inform the compiler about non-overlapping memory accesses
