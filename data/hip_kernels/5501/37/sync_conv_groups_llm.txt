```
// Optimize memory access by using shared memory where applicable
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize divergence by restructuring conditional statements
// Utilize __launch_bounds__ for better thread block occupancy
// Prefetch data into local variables to reduce repeated global memory access
// Consider using vectorized operations for aligned memory transactions
