```
// Use coalesced memory access for better performance
// Ensure A, B, C arrays are aligned to improve memory access speed
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns to use memory bandwidth efficiently
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
