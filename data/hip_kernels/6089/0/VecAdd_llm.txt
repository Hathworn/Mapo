```
// Use shared memory to cache data during computations to reduce global memory access.
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses.
// Consider using float4 or float2 data types to load/store multiple data elements at once for better memory throughput.
// Ensure that all `A[idx]`, `B[idx]`, and `C[idx]` accesses are aligned to achieve maximum memory bandwidth.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
