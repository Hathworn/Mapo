```
// Use shared memory to load portions of the target image for better memory access patterns.
// Minimize the use of __ldg by using shared memory where applicable.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data access to warp size.
// Use asynchronous memory prefetching for larger datasets if beneficial.
// Consider loop unrolling if there are repeating access patterns within loops.
// Evaluate the use of vectorized memory operations, such as float4, for loading and storing pixel data.
