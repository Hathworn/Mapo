```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory more effectively by minimizing bank conflicts
// Pre-fetch multiple elements to shared memory within a single iteration
// Ensure memory access patterns utilize aligned memory for optimal performance
// Optimize loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism
// Consider using vectorized loads and stores if supported
