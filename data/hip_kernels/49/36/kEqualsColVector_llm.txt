// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure shared memory size is sufficient for use case.
// Utilize thread cooperation to maximize shared memory efficiency.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniform branch execution.
// Consider tile-based processing for larger matrices.
