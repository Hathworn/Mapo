```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache the column vector for faster access
// Optimize memory access patterns to coalesce global memory reads and writes
// Evaluate the use of half-precision arithmetic if precision permits for improved performance
// Reduce the number of arithmetic operations by reordering calculations, if possible
// Consider unrolling the loop to hide latency and improve throughput
