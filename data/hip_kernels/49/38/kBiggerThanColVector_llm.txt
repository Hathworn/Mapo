```
// Use 2D block and grid structures to optimize memory access patterns
// Align memory access to coalesced memory access patterns for 'mat' and 'tgtMat'
// Consider shared memory usage to further reduce global memory access latencies
// Ensure boundary checks to avoid out-of-bounds errors and reduce unnecessary calculations
