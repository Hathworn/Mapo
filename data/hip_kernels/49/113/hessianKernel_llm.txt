```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses by ensuring data is stored in linear thread order.
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses for the same data across threads.
// Optimize boundary check logic to minimize divergent threads and enhance warp efficiency.
// Preload values from global to registers to reduce global memory instructions.
// Evaluate fusing the kernel with adjacent computation steps to minimize global memory traffic.
