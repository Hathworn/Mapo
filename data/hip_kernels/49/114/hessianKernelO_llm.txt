```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_gxx, d_gxy, d_gxz, d_gyy, d_gyz, d_gzz to improve memory throughput.
// Utilize shared memory if reused values from global memory can be shared among threads within the same block.
// Assess potential for loop unrolling in computeDeterminant to reduce overhead and increase throughput.
// Evaluate using constant memory for values like sigma that don't change per thread and are read often.
// Opt for using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers if possible to allow for better compiler optimizations.
// Explore using warp-level primitives for reduction operations, especially when computing maxEig.
