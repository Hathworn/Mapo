```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal global memory throughput.
// Preload repeated calculations outside of the loop to minimize redundant computations.
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Consider occupancy and adjust block and grid sizes for better parallel efficiency.
```
