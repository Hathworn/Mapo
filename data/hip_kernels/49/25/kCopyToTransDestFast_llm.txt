// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency and bandwidth utilization.
// Reverse indices for coalesced global memory access.
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring only valid threads participate with boundary checks.
// Align shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during shared memory operations.
