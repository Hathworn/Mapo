```
// Consider using memory coalescing to optimize memory access patterns
// Ensure shared memory usage is minimized and efficient to prevent bank conflicts
// Explore the possibility of using vectorized loads/stores for a and b
// Evaluate benefits of loop unrolling in the main processing loop for further optimization
// Reduce global memory access by accumulating results in shared memory before writing
