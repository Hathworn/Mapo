// Consider using shared memory to store parts of a and b for better memory access patterns
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing global memory in a contiguous fashion
// Minimize divergent branching in the loop by aligning the bounds with warp size
// Explore the use of read-only data cache to improve memory bandwidth utilization
