```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring threads access contiguous memory
// Avoid bank conflicts by accessing memory in a stride pattern that aligns with warp size
// Reduce global memory access by loading data into shared memory when possible
// Ensure loops are unrolled by the compiler or manually unroll them for efficiency
