```
// Use shared memory if repeated access to the same data is detected
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for optimal memory throughput
// Consider changing data layout to Structure of Arrays (SoA) for better memory access efficiency
// Investigate asynchronous memory prefetching to overlap data transfer with computation
// Use loop unrolling for reduced loop overhead if it leads to significant performance gain
