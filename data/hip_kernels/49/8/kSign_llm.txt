```
// Prefer coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Ensure alignment of data structures to take advantage of memory coalescing.
// Minimize use of conditional statements inside the loop to reduce divergence.
// Consider using shared memory for data reused within a block to reduce global memory accesses.
// Optimize the number of threads per block to fully utilize GPU resources.
