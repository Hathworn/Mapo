```
// Consider optimizing memory access with coalesced reads and writes
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency
// Ensure memory alignment for better performance
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop
// Avoid bank conflicts if using shared memory
