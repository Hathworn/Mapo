```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization
// Implement double buffering to overlap computation and data transfer
// Align data structures to achieve aligned memory access
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data
// Unroll inner loops more aggressively if register pressure allows
