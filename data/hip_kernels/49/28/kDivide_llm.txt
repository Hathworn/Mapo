```
// Optimize memory access by ensuring that all threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations
// Consider increasing the number of blocks to better utilize GPU resources
// Ensure that accesses to shared memory are done in a coalesced manner
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead
// Evaluate the use of __fdividef for performance and precision trade-offs
