// Consider using shared memory to cache rows for reducing global memory accesses
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Utilize fewer threads if warp divergence occurs due to varying heights
// Experiment with different thread block sizes to improve occupancy
