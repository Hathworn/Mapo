```c
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory throughput
// Utilize shared memory to minimize global memory access and increase data reusability
// Optimize loop unrolling for parallel threads to reduce instruction overhead
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to avoid performance penalties
// Evaluate using asynchronous memory copies with streams to overlap computation with data transfers
```
