```cpp
// Coalesced global memory access can improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider using shared memory for the smoothing window to reduce repeated global memory accesses.
// Optimize integer division by replacing it with bitwise operations if possible, particularly for power of two sizes.
// Ensure that boundary checks inside the loops do not lead to divergence across threads in a warp.
