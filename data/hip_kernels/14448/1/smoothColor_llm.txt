```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access
// Consider utilizing shared memory for storing intermediate pixel values
// Minimize global memory accesses by accumulating results using shared memory
// Reorganize loops to improve data reuse and reduce redundant calculations
// Ensure that all memory accesses are aligned for better performance
// Use warp-level operations for efficient data processing within blocks
