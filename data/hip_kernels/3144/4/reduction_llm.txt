```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory access speed
// Consider using warp shuffle instead of shared memory for reductions within a warp
// Minimize __syncthreads() usage to reduce synchronization overhead
// Ensure shared memory access is conflict-free by aligning data
```
