```c
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for both 'a' and 'b'
// Minimize warp divergence by using conditional statements efficiently
// Consider altering block size for optimal occupancy
// Ensure data alignment for potential coalescing benefits
// Evaluate memory access patterns for potential bank conflicts
```
