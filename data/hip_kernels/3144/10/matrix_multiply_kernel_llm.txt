// Consider coalesced memory access to improve global memory throughput
// Evaluate the use of shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Add prefetching to hide memory latency for vector_in
// Explore using warp shuffle to reduce the need for memory accesses during the reduction
// Ensure memory alignment to take advantage of memory access patterns
// Evaluate using asynchronous memory copy if applicable
