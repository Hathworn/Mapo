```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed elements and reduce global memory access
// Ensure loop unrolling factor is optimal for targeted hardware
// Consider padding 'dataset' to avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory
// Assess impact of parallelization on numerical precision and adjust accordingly
