```
// Consider using shared memory for loading atoms to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align shared memory initialization for performance optimization.
// Minimize divergence in loops by ensuring threads within a warp execute the same instructions.
// Optimize memory access patterns for coalescence when loading atom positions.
// Consider loop unrolling for the intra-block distance computation.
// Use cache memory effectively by reducing redundant data loading in critical paths.
// Ensure atomic operations are minimized and only happen outside performance-critical sections.
