```
// Consider using shared memory to store temporary histogram calculations to reduce global memory access.
// Explore using atomic operations to handle concurrent updates to the histogram when multiple threads work on the same bucket.
// Implement loop unrolling in the main while loop by processing multiple buckets per iteration to reduce loop overhead.
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access for all threads when accessing InputHists and hist arrays.
