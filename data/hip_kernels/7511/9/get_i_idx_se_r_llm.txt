```
// Use shared memory to store temporary data if multiple threads access the same memory location
// Consider using texture memory for more efficient reads if ilist is frequently accessed
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning nloc and blockDim.x with memory banks size
// Reduce thread divergence by minimizing conditional checks within the kernel
