```
// Use shared memory to store jrange and jlist to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses to nlist, nei_iter_dev, and key for better performance
// Consider using warp-level primitives for synchronization when updating row_nlist
// Optimize access patterns to sec_a to increase memory throughput
