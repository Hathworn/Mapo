```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure thread blocks contain a sufficient number of threads to fully utilize the GPU's resources
// Implement efficient thread synchronization to avoid serialization within the warp
// Optimize shared memory usage to avoid bank conflicts for higher access speed
// Check if the optimal block size is being used to maximize occupancy
