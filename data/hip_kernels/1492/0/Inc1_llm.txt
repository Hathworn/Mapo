```
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers for Ad and Bd to inform the compiler of non-aliasing and improve load/store optimizations
// Use __ldg() intrinsic for read-only memory accesses to take advantage of L1 cache for Ad
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced by aligning data loads/stores
// Consider adjusting block size and grid size for optimal occupancy and performance
// Explore using shared memory to reduce global memory bandwidth pressure if data reuse is possible
// Evaluate using atomic operations if multiple threads need to update the same data point
