```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for tiles of matrix_a and matrix_b to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for both matrix_a and matrix_b when loading into shared memory.
// Optimize the loop inside rowcol_dot to maximize data reuse within shared memory.
// Consider loop unrolling techniques for the dot product calculation.
// Use warp-level primitives for faster synchronization if the GPU architecture supports it.
