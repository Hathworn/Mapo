// Consider using shared memory to store 'accuracy' if accessed by multiple threads within a block
// Reduce warp divergence by ensuring only necessary threads enter the condition
// Ensure 'accuracy' is correctly initialized and available across kernel calls
// Consider atomic operations if multiple threads may update 'accuracy' in future changes
