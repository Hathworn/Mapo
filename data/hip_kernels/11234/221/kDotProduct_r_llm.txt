// Unroll loop to reduce branch overhead and increase instruction throughput
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Optimize reduction using warp shuffle techniques for faster synchronization
// Use volatile qualifier for shared memory in warp shuffle to prevent reordering and ensure visibility
