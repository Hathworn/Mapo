```c
// Align memory access if possible for coalesced reads/writes to accuracy
// Ensure N is a multiple of the warp size for optimal performance
// Utilize shared memory if multiple threads access overlapping data
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword to suggest non-aliasing of pointers
// Implement loop unrolling for potential performance gain
