```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to optimize memory access
// Ensure that thread divergence is minimized
// Experiment with different block sizes to find optimal performance
// Align data to improve memory transaction efficiency
// Utilize __ldg() for read-only data if hardware and compiler support it
