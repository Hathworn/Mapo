```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointers to improve memory access patterns.
// Align data access to enable coalesced memory transactions for arrays 'probs' and 'labels'.
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results if the computation pattern involves reuse.
// Ensure that the access to 'probs' inside the loop is coalesced by accessing continuous indices.
// Minimize usage of shared memory bank conflicts by padding shared arrays.
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce latency of global memory access.
// Evaluate unrolling the loop to decrease loop overhead and potentially increase performance.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations for reductions like counting 'numMax'.
