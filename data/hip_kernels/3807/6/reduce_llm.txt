```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Initialize shared memory with appropriate bounds checking
// Use zero-padding in shared memory to handle out-of-bounds indices
// Implement loop unrolling to improve performance
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous global memory
// Synchronize threads efficiently after shared memory operations
// Accumulate results locally within the block
