```
// Use shared memory to store data from global memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce memory accesses to d_in and d_out to improve memory bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling for repeated kernel element access to enhance performance
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures to take advantage of memory coalescing
