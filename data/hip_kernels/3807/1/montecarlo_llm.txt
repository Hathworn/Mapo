```
// Use registers to store loop variables and reduce accesses to shared memory.
// Ensure that the use of shared memory is limited to avoid bank conflicts.
// Maximize the use of registers to reduce global memory read and write.
// Consider loop unrolling for better performance in iterative calculations.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing for better performance.
