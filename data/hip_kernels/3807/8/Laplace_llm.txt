// Use shared memory to minimize global memory transactions
// Optimize computation by leveraging shared memory when accessing neighboring elements
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve performance
// Ensure maximum utilization of shared memory to reduce latency
// Handle boundary elements carefully to avoid unnecessary memory access
