```c
// Use __constant__ memory for constants if they are frequently used by all threads.
// Consider optimizing hiprand_init to use precomputed sequences to reduce setup time.
// Ensure single-warp execution to minimize __syncthreads() overhead.
// Use coalesced memory accesses when writing to d_out to improve memory throughput.
// Evaluate if reducing global memory reads is possible by recalculating values within the loop.
