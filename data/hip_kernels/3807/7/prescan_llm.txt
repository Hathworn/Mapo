```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_in array.
// Use shared memory to exploit data reuse and minimize global memory access.
// Align data access to improve memory coalescing.
// Minimize memory traffic through use of temporary registers.
// Explore using warp-level primitives to reduce divergence.
// Investigate effects of increasing thread block size for better occupancy.
