// Consider coalesced memory access for better memory throughput.
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized to reduce bank conflicts.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling could provide performance benefits in computational heavy sections.
// Check if constant memory can be used for frequently accessed read-only data.
// Consider minimizing synchronization points to reduce divergence and overhead.
