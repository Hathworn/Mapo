```cpp
// Minimize global memory accesses by computing indices as needed
// Reduce divergence by ensuring only one thread executes control flow statements like printf
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results when possible
// Coalesce memory accesses by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Optimize memory transfers between host and device by using asynchronous operations
// Ensure kernel launches are done with optimal block and grid sizes for better occupancy
```
