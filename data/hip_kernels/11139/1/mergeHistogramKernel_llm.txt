```
// Consider using warp-level primitives like __shfl_down_sync to avoid __syncthreads overhead in reduction
// Coalesced memory access: ensure d_PartialHistograms access is coalesced for better memory bandwidth utilization
// Prefetch data into registers to minimize global memory access latency
// Use dynamic shared memory if MERGE_THREADBLOCK_SIZE is flexible to minimize wasted memory
```
