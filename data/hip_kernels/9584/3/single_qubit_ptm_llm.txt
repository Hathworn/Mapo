```
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes.
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data (ptm_g) to optimize caching.
// Ensure shared memory usage is efficient and fits within the hardware limits.
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring appropriate alignment.
// Minimize the arithmetic intensity inside the kernel to improve performance.
