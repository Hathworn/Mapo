// Use coalesced memory access patterns to minimize memory transaction overhead.
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce repeated global memory access.
// Optimize the calculation of addr2 for potential reduction in operations or use of registers.
// Consider loop unrolling if there are repetitive patterns within the kernel logic.
// Check for warp-level optimizations, such as warp shuffle, if applicable for data exchange within the kernel.
