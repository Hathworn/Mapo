```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning read operations to consecutive threads for better performance.
// Use __ldg() intrinsics for read-only data to take advantage of cached load operations if appropriate.
// Evaluate the need for warp-level primitives to optimize calculations that require inter-thread communication.
