```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve throughput
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Use memory alignment for better access patterns
// Ensure memory operations are vectorized where possible
// Minimize branching within kernel execution
// Prefetch data to leverage memory latency hiding
```
