```
// Consider using __restrict__ keyword for pointers to improve memory access efficiency.
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transaction overhead.
// Evaluate if loop unrolling improves performance for address calculations.
// Utilize warp shuffles to minimize the need for global or shared memory for data exchange.
// Consider using constant memory for any values that remain unchanged across kernel executions.
