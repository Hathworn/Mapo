```c
// Consider coalesced global memory access for 'dm' to improve memory throughput
// Use shared memory for 'ptm' to exploit data reuse and reduce global memory reads
// Optimize thread synchronization to minimize the overhead by careful arrangement of shared memory usage
// Ensure all memory accesses are aligned to avoid misaligned memory access penalties
```
