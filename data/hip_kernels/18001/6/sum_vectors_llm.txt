// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for the atomic add operation.
// Consider coalesced memory access for both src and dst arrays to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize block size to better utilize memory bandwidth and GPU resources.
// Use loop unrolling for potential performance improvement with the atomic add operation.
