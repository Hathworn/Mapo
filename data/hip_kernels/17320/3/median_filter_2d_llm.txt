```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Minimize the size of the global memory window in each thread to reduce bandwidth
// Use loop unrolling in bubble sort for better performance
// Avoid frequent use of min/max in loops, compute once outside loop when possible
// Cache input indices as local variables to avoid repeated calculations
