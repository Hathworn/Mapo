```
// Use shared memory for vector_in to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure the shared memory size does not exceed the maximum limit.
// Consider coalesced access for loading matrix data into the threads.
// Optimize access pattern to ensure maximum memory coalescing.
// Reduce unnecessary synchronizations where possible.
