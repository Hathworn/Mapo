// There are no specific optimization suggestions provided in the code.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for optimal performance.
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure minimal divergence by organizing threads for similar execution paths.
// Ensure efficient use of registers by minimizing register pressure.
