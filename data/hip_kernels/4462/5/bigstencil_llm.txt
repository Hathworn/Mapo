// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses and improve memory coalescing
// Ensure global memory reads are coalesced by appropriate alignment and use of shared memory
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory to avoid race conditions
// Consider further optimizing thread block size for better occupancy and less idle time
