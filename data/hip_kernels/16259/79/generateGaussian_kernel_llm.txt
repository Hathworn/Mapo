```
// Precompute constant value for deltaSquared to minimize repeated calculations
// Use __expf for faster exponential computation in the kernel
// Ensure coalesced memory access when writing to og array for better memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads require same data to reduce global memory reads
// Reduce divergent branches by simplifying calculations and ensuring warp uniformity
