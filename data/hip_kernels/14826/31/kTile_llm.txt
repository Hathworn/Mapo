```
// Optimize shared memory usage by ensuring alignment and minimizing bank conflicts.
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Experiment with different block sizes to achieve better occupancy and performance.
// Avoid redundant calculations within the loop; pre-compute values if possible.
// Evaluate using constant memory for often-read data to increase cache efficiency.
// Test different grid and block configurations for optimal performance based on hardware.
