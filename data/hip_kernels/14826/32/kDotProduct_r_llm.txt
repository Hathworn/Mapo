```
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory access latency
// Implement warp-level primitive for efficient reduction
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory locations
// Use __shfl_down_sync for warp-level reduction to reduce synchronization overhead
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by ensuring proper indexing
// Write results to global memory only once per block to reduce global memory traffic
