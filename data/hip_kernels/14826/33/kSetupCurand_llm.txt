```
// Limit the number of launched threads to avoid unnecessary computation
// Use shared memory or registers if possible to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Consider using warp-synchronous programming to reduce thread divergence
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy
