```
// Ensure optimal memory coalescing when accessing input_k array
// Consider using loop unrolling for the first for-loop to enhance performance
// Leverage shared memory buffer to minimize global memory access for intermediate results
// Optimize atomic operations to reduce contention and improve update efficiency
// Evaluate the effectiveness of the buffer size in shared memory and adjust if necessary
