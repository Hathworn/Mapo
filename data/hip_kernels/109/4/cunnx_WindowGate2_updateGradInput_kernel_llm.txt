// Use shared memory for frequent memory access to reduce global memory transactions.
// Ensure all threads synchronize after memory transfer for data consistency.
// Adjust shared memory size according to the windowStride to optimize space usage.
// Synchronize threads after computation to ensure shared memory consistency.
