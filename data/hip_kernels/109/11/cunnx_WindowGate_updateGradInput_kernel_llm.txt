```
// Consider aligning memory accesses to improve memory coalescing
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access latency
// Implement loop unrolling in the gradient computation for better performance
// Optimize the reduction using warp-level primitives for faster convergence
// Avoid redundant computations, such as recalculating buffer[tx], where possible
