```cpp
// Use shared memory for intermediate computations to reduce global memory access
// Perform parallel reduction strategy to minimize synchronization overhead
// Minimize shared memory usage where possible to increase block occupancy
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce the number of synchronization points
// Coalesce memory accesses where possible to improve global memory bandwidth
// Consider using __ldg intrinsics for read-only data for better caching
