```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure shared memory usage is minimal to avoid bank conflicts.
// Opt for coalesced global memory access to improve bandwidth.
// Minimize atomic operations in shared memory for better performance.
// Consider loop unrolling to minimize overhead in the for-loop.
// Align data to avoid memory access misalignment.
