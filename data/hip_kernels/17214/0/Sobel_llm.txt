```
// Align memory access to improve coalesced access patterns
// Use shared memory effectively to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Minimize thread divergence by optimizing conditional blocks
// Clearly define Sobel kernels to maximize instruction throughput
// Consider pre-computed constants for Sobel kernels to reduce computation
// Optimize loop bounds to minimize unnecessary computations
// Leverage texture or read-only cache for faster memory access if applicable
// Explore warp shuffle techniques to minimize __syncthreads overhead
