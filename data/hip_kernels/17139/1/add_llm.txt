// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data if applicable
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for better performance
// Adjust block size to achieve optimal occupancy
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to inform the compiler about non-aliasing pointers
// Prefetch data into registers wherever possible to reduce memory latency
