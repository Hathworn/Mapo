```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to gradInput_data and gradOutput_data to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce repetitive global memory access, especially inside the loops.
// Reorganize the data layout to ensure better memory access patterns and coalescing.
// Avoid using non-coalesced access patterns by aligning data access with warp boundaries.
// Minimize divergent warps by ensuring that all threads within a warp follow the same execution path.
