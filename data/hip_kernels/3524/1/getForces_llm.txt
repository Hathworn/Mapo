```cpp
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access when loading positions to shared memory
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal shared memory usage
// Utilize loop unrolling to enhance throughput
// Synchronize threads to prevent race conditions
// Check boundary conditions to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
