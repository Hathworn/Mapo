```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for g_pos and d_pos to improve memory throughput.
// Reduce global memory accesses by storing intermediate results in registers when possible.
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed elements to minimize global memory access latency.
// Optimize data access patterns to enhance cache utilization and reduce memory access bottlenecks.
// Ensure aligned memory access for improved performance and to avoid bank conflicts.
