// Use __shared__ memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Increase data locality by loading data into shared memory for reuse.
// Use __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions when accessing shared memory.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads within the same warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
