```cpp
// Optimize memory access by ensuring coalesced reads and writes where possible.
// Minimize use of global memory by storing repetitive calculations in registers.
// Consider using shared memory to store repeated anchor calculations for better performance.
// Ensure bank conflicts in shared memory are minimized by using appropriate padding.
// To improve efficiency, try loop unrolling for small and predictable loop counts.
// Reduce divergent branches by restructuring conditional logic where feasible.
