// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster access.
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access.
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Experiment with different block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and performance.
