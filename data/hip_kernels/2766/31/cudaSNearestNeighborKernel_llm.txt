```
// Ensure global memory access is coalesced for better performance
// Reduce bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Avoid divergent branches to optimize warp execution
// Consider using shared memory to cache input data for further optimization
// Evaluate the use of vectorized memory operations to improve throughput
