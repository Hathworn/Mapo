// Use shared memory to store inputs and avoid redundant global memory loads
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for inputs and outputs to improve memory bandwidth
// Use warp-level intrinsic functions to minimize divergence and maximize computational efficiency
// Avoid branching within warp, consider using predicated operations to handle maskIndex calculations
// Optimize memory alignment for input and output arrays to prevent memory access penalties
// Prefetch data from global memory to local variables to reduce repeated memory access latency
