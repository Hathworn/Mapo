```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data accesses across threads
// Minimize divergent branches within the warp
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed data if beneficial
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead
// Optimize floating-point operations by reducing complexity through algebraic transformations
```
