// Consider coalescing memory accesses for ROIRef and ROIEst to improve memory bandwidth.
// Optimize memory access patterns for partsEst and partsVisibilityEst to achieve better coalescing.
// Use shared memory to store frequently accessed variables like means and std to reduce global memory access latency.
// Organize the computation and access pattern to minimize warp divergence for better performance.
// Consider unrolling loops where beneficial, such as the template and parts estimation loops.
