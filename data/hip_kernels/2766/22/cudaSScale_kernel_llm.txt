```cpp
// Use shared memory to load input data if the data reuse is high to reduce global memory access.
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to input and result arrays to optimize memory bandwidth usage.
// Experiment with different block sizes and grid dimensions to find the optimal configuration.
// Minimize divergence by ensuring uniformity in conditional operations across warp.
