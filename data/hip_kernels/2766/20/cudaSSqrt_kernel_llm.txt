```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure synchronized access to shared memory to prevent race conditions
// Consider coalescing global memory access for better performance
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory access for better performance
