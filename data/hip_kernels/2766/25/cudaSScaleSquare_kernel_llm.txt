```
// Consider using __restrict__ pointers to potentially increase memory access performance
// Optimize memory access by ensuring input and result arrays are aligned
// Use shared memory if data reuse across threads within the same block is beneficial
// Prefetch next chunk of data while processing current data to hide memory latency
// Evaluate potential use of warp-aggregated atomic operations if applicable
