```
// Consider using shared memory if each thread requires repeated access to the same data
// Stride loop allows coalesced memory access which is preferred for better performance
// Ensure power is not recalculated repeatedly within the loop by loading it into a register
// Ensure x and y pointers are aligned for optimal memory access efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches and ensure the grid is fully occupied for best performance
