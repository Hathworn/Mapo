```
// Consider utilizing coalesced memory access for the firingRate array.
// Ensure shared memory usage is within the limits of the specific GPU architecture.
// Use appropriate occupancy settings to maximize warp efficiency.
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal reduction performance.
// Take advantage of more aggressive loop unrolling for the reduction loop.
// Evaluate the impact of using different shared memory sizes.
