```cpp
// Optimize global memory access by coalescing reads and writes.
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Avoid redundant calculations inside loops for better performance.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Consider varying block size for different workloads to maximize occupancy.
