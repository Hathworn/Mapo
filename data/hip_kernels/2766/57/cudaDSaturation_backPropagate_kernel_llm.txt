// Use shared memory efficiently by ensuring threads within a block cooperate to minimize global memory access.
// Reduce conditional branching by employing precomputation and loop unrolling where applicable.
// Implement memory coalescing to improve global memory access patterns.
// Consider the use of vectorized operations to handle multiple elements per thread if applicable.
