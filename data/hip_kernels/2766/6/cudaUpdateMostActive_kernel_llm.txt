```
// Coalesce memory access to exampleIds and exampleFiringRate
// Use shared memory to store intermediate results for firing rates
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp execute the same path
// Use block shared memory to store intermediate max values to reduce global memory accesses
