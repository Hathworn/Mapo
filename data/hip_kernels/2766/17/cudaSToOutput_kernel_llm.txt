```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Align data structures to 32-byte boundaries to optimize memory access patterns.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to improve warp execution efficiency.
// Consider using memory prefetching to hide memory latencies.
// Optimize the launch configuration to achieve full occupancy, balancing between threads per block and block count.
// Reduce the number of IO operations by combining multiple outputs into single transactions.
