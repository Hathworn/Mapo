```
// Use coalesced global memory access patterns to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure that shared memory size is sufficient to prevent bank conflicts.
// Minimize use of __syncthreads to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Consider using warp-level primitives for efficient reduction within a warp.
// Avoid unnecessary memory accesses by caching frequently used values in registers.
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory transactions.
