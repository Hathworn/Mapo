```
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for x and y arrays
// Precompute constant values outside the loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Utilize shared memory if data reuse within blocks is possible
// Consider loop unrolling for potential performance gain
// Minimize divergence by organizing conditional branches
