```
// Use shared memory to improve coalesced memory access for diffInput and argMax
// Ensure blockDim.x fits the shared memory capacity to avoid excessive usage
// Optimize stride access pattern to minimize thread divergence
// Consider prefetching data to shared memory for subsequent iterations
// Optimize __syncthreads usage to reduce synchronization overhead
