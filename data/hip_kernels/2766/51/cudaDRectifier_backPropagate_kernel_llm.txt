// Precompute shifting factors outside the loop to avoid redundant calculations
// Apply shifting factor directly to reduce register usage
// Combine conditional statements to reduce branch divergence
// Use a constant memory for commonly used small values like leakSlope to improve memory access time if needed
// Consider using shared memory for any data reused within a thread block if applicable
// Optimize memory pattern access by ensuring coalesced access if possible
