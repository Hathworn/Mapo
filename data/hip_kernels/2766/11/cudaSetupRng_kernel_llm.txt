```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for storing temporary data inside the kernel.
// Optimize memory access patterns to achieve coalesced memory accesses.
// Minimize the use of global memory by preferring registers and shared memory.
// Ensure memory alignment to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory accesses.
