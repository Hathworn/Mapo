```
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Minimize branching within the loop for better warp execution efficiency
// Evaluate the need to use texture memory for read-only data
// Assess utilization of half-precision for possible compute optimizations
