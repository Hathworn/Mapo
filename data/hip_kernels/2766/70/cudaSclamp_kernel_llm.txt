// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Utilize shared memory if repeated reads from global memory can be minimized with intermediate storage
// Adjust block and grid dimensions to maximize hardware utilization and minimize warp divergence
// Evaluate warp execution efficiency and avoid conditional branching within the loop
// Explore loop unrolling for potentially better instruction parallelism
