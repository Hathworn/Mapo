```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic
// Leverage compiler flags to unroll loops automatically for better pipeline utilization
// Optimize branch divergence by reordering conditional operations
// Investigate potential use of vectorized memory operations for improved throughput
// Utilize memory prefetching techniques to proactively load data during computation
// Assess the possibility of using atomic operations if synchronization is required among threads
