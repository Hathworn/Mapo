```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory access times.
// Ensure that vectors x1, x2, and y are aligned to optimize memory coalescing.
// Use loop unrolling to decrease the loop overhead and improve throughput.
// Analyze divergence in warp execution and ensure all threads follow the same execution path to maximize efficiency.
