```cpp
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for input and maxVal arrays
// Use shared memory to store input values if possible
// Optimize atomic operations by minimizing their usage
// Ensure that data alignment is optimal for memory transactions
// Investigate if using warp-level primitives can reduce contention
```
