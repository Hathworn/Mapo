```
// Avoid redundant fetching of constant data by using shared memory.
// Precompute values to minimize recalculations during iterations.
// Use shared memory to store constants, reducing global memory accesses.
// Optimize conditionals by using shared memory for frequently accessed values.
// Minimize division operations by utilizing bit shifts for power-of-two divisors.
