```
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve memory throughput
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Unroll loops for better instruction-level parallelism and efficiency
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for the specific GPU architecture
// Minimize thread divergence by aligning conditional checks
```
