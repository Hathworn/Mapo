// Consider using shared memory to cache diffInput values accessed multiple times.
// Adjust block size to better match the input dimensions and improve memory access patterns.
// Optimize the thread block layout to minimize warp divergence.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques to reduce loop overhead.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and access patterns.
