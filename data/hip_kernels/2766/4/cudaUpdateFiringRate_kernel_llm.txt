```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Ensure all threads within a block are converged before accessing shared memory
// Reduce number of synchronization points
// Ensure data is coalesced when writing to and reading from global memory
// Minimize thread divergence by ensuring all pathways are equally executed
```
