```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses for better memory throughput
// Ensure optimal block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
// Minimize divergent branches by simplifying conditional statements
// Utilize shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency
// Check for memory alignment to optimize memory access patterns
