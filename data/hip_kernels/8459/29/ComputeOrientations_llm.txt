```
// Optimize memory coalescing for g_Data access patterns
// Pad shared memory arrays for alignment to prevent bank conflicts
// Consider loop unrolling to eliminate branch divergence
// Use __ldg for read-only global memory access for potentially faster loads
// Ensure shared memory allocation fits within hardware limits
// Reuse shared memory effectively by reducing unnecessary __syncthreads()
// Minimize atomic operations by improving histogram reduction
// Evaluate the benefits of reducing precision for operations where applicable
