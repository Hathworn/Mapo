// Use coalesced memory accesses to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory arrays.
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase execution efficiency.
// Employ synchronization after shared memory writes to ensure data consistency.
// Arrange data access patterns to take advantage of spatial locality.
