```
// Use shared memory to minimize repeated global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure synchronization after loading data into shared memory
// Optimize loop boundaries to reduce redundant calculations
// Consider bank conflicts in shared memory access by adjusting memory access pattern
// Prioritize coalesced memory access for ptrs array
// Limit thread divergence by optimizing conditional statements
