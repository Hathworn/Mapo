```c
// Consider coalesced memory access for d_Data to improve read efficiency.
// Ensure proper thread block size to optimize shared memory usage.
// Use of __syncthreads() is necessary after shared memory reduction.
// Consider padding shared memory arrays to avoid bank conflicts.
// Ensure grid size covers the entire data set to avoid undefined behavior.
// Minimize use of conditional checks inside the main processing loop.
