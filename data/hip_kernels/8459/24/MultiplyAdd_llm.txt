```
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by using appropriate data layouts
// Minimize global memory accesses by reusing loaded data within threads
// Prefer using texture memory for read-only data if possible
// Optimize block and grid dimensions for better occupancy
