```
// Consider using float4 or float2 data types for coalesced memory access in g_Data loading.
// Ensure proper alignment by adjusting array indexing for more effective use of shared memory.
// Apply loop unrolling for better performance in initializing and reducing histogram values.
// Preload and cache frequently accessed global memory values into shared memory to reduce latency.
// Optimize branching by reorganizing conditional statements to minimize divergent branches.
// Consider kernel occupancy to ensure enough resources are available for concurrent execution.
// Use built-in mathematical functions such as __sinf or __cosf for potential speed improvements.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to improve bandwidth utilization when accessing g_Data.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for cached reads of g_Data if spatial locality is high.
