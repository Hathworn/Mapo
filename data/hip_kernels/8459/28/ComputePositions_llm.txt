```
// Consider using shared memory to load data values for coalesced access.
// Preload values using shared memory for reduced global memory access latency.
// Ensure aligned accesses to g_Data1, g_Data2, and g_Data3 for more efficient memory transactions.
// Use loop unrolling for repetitive operations such as sum calculations to improve throughput.
// Consider placing the determinant calculations inside a separate inline function for repeated use.
// Utilize constant memory for any fixed parameters like d_ConstantA and d_ConstantB.
// Reduce divergent branching by consolidating correction conditions and operations.
