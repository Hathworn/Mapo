```cpp
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for better global memory performance
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses if possible
// Ensure data alignment to fully utilize memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring conditional checks are uniform
```
