// Use shared memory to store partial results to reduce global memory accesses.
// Unroll loop to process two elements per iteration to improve performance.
// Ensure efficient memory accesses by accessing contiguous memory locations.
// Optimize reduction step using loop unrolling to minimize synchronization overhead.
// Store only partial results in global memory after accumulating in shared memory.
