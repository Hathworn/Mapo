```c
// Consider increasing occupancy by optimizing shared memory usage
// Use loop unrolling for memory access pattern improvement
// Utilize shared memory for faster data access
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data and threads appropriately
// Explore asynchronous memory prefetching to hide memory latency
```
