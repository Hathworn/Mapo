// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring that global memory access is aligned
// Consider adjusting block size for optimal shared memory utilization
// Utilize more threads per block if shared memory size allows
// Balance shared memory usage with register usage to avoid bank conflicts
// Apply warp-level reductions to further optimize shared memory usage
