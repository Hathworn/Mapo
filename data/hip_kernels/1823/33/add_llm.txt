// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data properly
// Optimize memory transfers by using asynchrony or pinned memory
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize memory divergence among threads in a warp
// Analyze memory access patterns to improve throughput
