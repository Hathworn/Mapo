```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access for atomic operations.
// Consider prefetching data into shared memory to minimize global memory latency.
// Optimize thread block size to maximize occupancy and balance memory access.
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing consecutive memory indices within a warp.
