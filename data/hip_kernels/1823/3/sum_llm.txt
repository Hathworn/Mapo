// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses for repeated data access.
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for 'a', 'b', and 'c' arrays.
// Minimize thread divergence by restructuring boundary condition checks. 
// Evaluate if loop unrolling can improve performance for larger workloads.
