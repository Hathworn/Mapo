```
// Increase the grid size to use more blocks and utilize more of the GPU
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures appropriately
// Consider using pinned memory for faster data transfer between host and device
// Use shared memory effectively to minimize global memory access latency
// Optimize loop unrolling based on the target architecture
// Evaluate the kernel launch configuration for optimal occupancy
// Use __restrict__ pointers to improve compiler optimizations by restricting aliasing
