```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses for improved memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent warps to enhance performance
// Optimize loop unrolling for improved throughput
// Use vectorized operations if applicable for better efficiency
// Balance the workload among threads to avoid load imbalance
