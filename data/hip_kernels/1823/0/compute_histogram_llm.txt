// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for data[i] to improve memory read efficiency.
// Use memory padding for shared memory to avoid bank conflicts during cache updates.
// Explore using warp-level primitives to optimize shared memory reduction.
// Check if using warp-synchronous programming reduces synchronization overhead.
