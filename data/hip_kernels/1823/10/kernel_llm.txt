```
// Ensure memory coalescing by adjusting data layout if needed
// Consider using shared memory to store temporary results for idx1 and idx2
// Minimize divergent branching by ensuring work per thread is uniform
// Analyze the possibility of loop unrolling if operations on a[idx], a[idx1], a[idx2] are repetitive
// Ensure utilization of vectorized operations if supported by the hardware
