```cpp
// Use shared memory for histogram bins to reduce global memory accesses
// Initialize shared memory bins
// Synchronize threads to ensure all shared memory is initialized
// Calculate the starting index and the offset to the next block each thread will process
// Accumulate data into shared memory to minimize global memory write contention
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is accumulated in shared memory
// Write the shared memory results to global memory
