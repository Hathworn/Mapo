```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures if possible
// Use dynamic shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Calculate stride outside the loop to prevent redundant calculations
// Use loop unrolling techniques to improve reduction performance
// Implement warp synchronous operations if applicable to reduce __syncthreads() overhead
