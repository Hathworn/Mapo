```cpp
// Optimize memory accesses by using shared memory for row indices.
// Ensure that sourceRowIndices remain within block scope to improve cache performance.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading row indices.
// Avoid conditional logic within the main data copying loop to enhance coalesced memory access.
// Prefer loading data in a coalesced manner to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Consider loop unrolling if the number of columns (nCols) is known at compile time for further optimization.
