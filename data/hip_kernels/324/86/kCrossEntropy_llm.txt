// Use shared memory for better memory access patterns if possible
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data like 'p' and 'mat'
// Ensure maximum coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Minimize global memory access by reusing data within shared memory
// Consider utilizing warp shuffle operations for intra-warp communication if beneficial
