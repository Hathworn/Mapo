```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Use vectorized loads if data alignment allows
// Ensure blocks are fully utilized by maximizing occupancy
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations if applicable
// Consider loop unrolling for stride-based memory access patterns
```
