```cpp
// Consider using shared memory if there are strided access patterns
// Check if coalesced memory access can be utilized
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for hardware occupancy
// Minimize potential warp divergence by structuring conditional statements
// Consider memory prefetching and double buffering techniques for repetitive access patterns
```
