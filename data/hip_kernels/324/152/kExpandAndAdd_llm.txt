```
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consolidate global memory accesses to improve memory coalescing
// Implement stride-based loop for workload balancing across threads
// Replace conditional handling with branch-free operations if possible
// Precompute indices and access patterns to optimize memory fetches
// Consider increasing shared memory size if block dimensions exceed 256
// Ensure shared memory is appropriately sized for varying blockDim.x values
// Profile memory access pattern to further enhance coalescing and cache utilization
