// Reduce global memory accesses by utilizing shared memory for mat1 and mat2
// Load elements into shared memory to increase memory access efficiency
// Use __syncthreads() after loading elements to ensure data consistency across threads
// Compute target using shared memory values for better performance
// Use __syncthreads() after computation to ensure all threads complete before the next iteration
