```c
// Ensure coalesced global memory access when reading from idata
// Consider using float4 to read and write for better memory throughput
// Use padding in shared memory for avoiding bank conflicts
// Prefetch data using multiple threads to overlap computation and memory operations
// Optimize block size to fully utilize GPU resources and match memory transaction sizes
// Use __restrict__ qualifier on pointers if no aliasing to help compiler optimization
```
