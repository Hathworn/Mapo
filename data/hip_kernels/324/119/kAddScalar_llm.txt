// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data access patterns
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize conditional statements in critical loops
// Ensure enough threads to keep GPU fully utilized
// Use atomic operations to prevent race conditions in concurrent modification
// Test different block sizes for optimal performance
