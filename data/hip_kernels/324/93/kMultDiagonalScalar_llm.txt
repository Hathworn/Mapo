```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring data used by threads in a warp is contiguous
// Use shared memory for data reuse if multiple threads access the same data
// Optimize for memory latency by ensuring enough threads to hide global memory latency
// Consider reducing memory accesses by using registers to hold temporary values
// Minimize divergent branches as all threads in a warp should follow the same execution path
