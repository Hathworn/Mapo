// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access if multiple threads access nearby data.
// Evaluate warp divergence and ensure memory coalescing for better memory throughput.
// Optimize block and thread dimensions to maximize occupancy and resource utilization.
// Ensure arrays are correctly aligned and use float4/float2 operations for faster vectorized processing.
