// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access for the mat and targets arrays
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently used data within a block to reduce global memory accesses
// Load data into registers where possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Evaluate the use of warp shuffle functions to optimize reductions and minimize branch divergence
