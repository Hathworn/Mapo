```
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access time.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures and using the optimal stride.
// Consider loop unrolling if complex operations are performed multiple times to reduce instruction overhead.
// Minimize bank conflicts by strategically organizing data in shared memory.
