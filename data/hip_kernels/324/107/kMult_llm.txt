```
// Use shared memory to cache data for a and b to reduce global memory access.
// Consider using vectorized loads/stores for coalesced memory access.
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced by aligning data structures.
// Minimize branch divergence by handling different scale_targets values separately outside the loop.
// Use loop unrolling techniques to increase instruction throughput.
