// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory access.
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Prefetch memory outside of the loop to minimize memory latency.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory to improve memory bandwidth and caching efficiency.
// Analyze the cache hit rate and adjust memory access patterns accordingly.
