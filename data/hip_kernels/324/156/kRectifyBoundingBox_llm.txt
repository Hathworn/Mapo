```cpp
// Optimize: use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Optimize: coalesce memory accesses for the boxes array to improve memory throughput
// Optimize: consider using texture memory for width_offset, height_offset, and flip arrays if they are mostly read-only
// Optimize: ensure that warp divergence is minimized by organizing condition checks outside the loop if possible
// Optimize: utilize vectorized operations for floating-point arithmetic if supported
