```c
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads read contiguous memory locations.
// Ensure the blocks and threads are configured based on the architecture to maximize occupancy.
// Consider using shared memory if the kernel accesses the mat array multiple times per thread.
// Utilize asynchronous memory fetching if appropriate to overlap computation and data transfer.
