```
// Use memory coalescing to optimize global memory access
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce latency
// Ensure aligned memory access for improved performance
// Utilize stream or kernel concurrency for potential further optimization
// Consider using half precision if applicable for improved throughput
