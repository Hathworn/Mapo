```
// Use shared memory to cache indices for faster repeated access
// Unroll the loop for improved performance if the 'mat_width' is known
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns to improve global memory efficiency
// Align memory accesses to ensure proper cache utilization
// Minimize divergent branches within the loop for better warp efficiency
