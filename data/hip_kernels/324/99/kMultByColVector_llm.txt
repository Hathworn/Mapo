```
// Use shared memory to load vector elements to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory by ensuring padding as necessary
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to enhance instruction-level parallelism
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for the mat and tgtMat arrays
// Optimize block and grid size configurations for better occupancy and throughput
