```
// Use shared memory for temporal storage of row sums to reduce global memory access
// Align memory accesses to avoid bank conflicts in shared memory
// Consider using float4 or other vectorized types for improved memory coalescing
// Optimize loop stride to maximize warp efficiency with height-based accesses
```
