```cpp
// Use __restrict__ to leverage potential compiler optimizations by indicating no aliasing
// Utilize shared memory to load frequently used data and minimize global memory access
// Unroll loop if possible to improve ILP and better utilize resources
// Use __syncthreads() wisely to ensure proper data loading and avoid unnecessary synchronization
// Minimize computation within loop by moving invariant calculations outside
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by configuring block size and grid size appropriately
// Consider further tuning of shared memory and registers based on specific hardware capabilities
// Leverage coalesced memory access patterns to reduce memory latency
