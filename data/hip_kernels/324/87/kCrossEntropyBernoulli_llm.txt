```cpp
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data in memory
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate data if reused within the loop
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to achieve optimal occupancy
// Use float operations instead of double for improved performance in GPUs
```
