// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Try optimizing the layout of images and targets to enable better caching
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Re-evaluate the use of __syncthreads() to minimize thread divergence
// Investigate loop unrolling for the loops iterating over `y` and `x`
