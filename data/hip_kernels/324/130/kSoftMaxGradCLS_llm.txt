```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Implement shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory transactions.
// Use __restrict__ keyword for pointers to potentially allow further compiler optimizations.
// Check for warp divergence due to conditional statements and attempt to minimize it.
// Optimize access to the 'labels' array by ensuring it's accessed in a coalesced manner.
