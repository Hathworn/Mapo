```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses when loading elements from mat into the loop.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by accessing mat and target in strides of height.
// Consider using memory prefetching techniques to overlap memory transfer latency with computation.
// Pay attention to bank conflicts in shared memory if added, using padding if necessary.
// Optimize the use of registers by limiting the number of variables declared within loops.
