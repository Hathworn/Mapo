// Use coalesced memory access to improve memory throughput
// Ensure memory alignment for float data types
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Minimize divergent branches by organizing threads to follow similar execution paths
// Evaluate the occupancy and adjust block size for better resource utilization
