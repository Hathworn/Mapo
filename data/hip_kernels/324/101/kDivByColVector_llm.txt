```
// Use shared memory for vec to reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesce global memory accesses for mat and tgtMat by accessing them with contiguous threads
// Consider loop unrolling for the division operation if performance is critical
// Use larger block size for better occupancy, but balance with shared memory usage
