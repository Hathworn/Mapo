```
// Consider coalesced memory access by aligning data structures
// Utilize shared memory if the adjacent threads access nearby elements
// Optimize loop unrolling factor based on hardware specifics
// Minimize divergent branches within ternary operations
// Ensure that the grid-stride loop matches the problem size correctly
