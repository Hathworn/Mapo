```
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations.
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory traffic.
// Optimize instruction-level parallelism by minimizing data dependencies between consecutive calculations.
// Apply loop unrolling techniques more aggressively by testing different unroll factors.
// Adjust block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and hide memory latency.
// Ensure memory access alignment to improve memory transaction efficiency.
// Profile the kernel to identify bottlenecks and further opportunities for optimization.
