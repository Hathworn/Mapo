```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align data in memory to improve coalesced memory access
// Use float4 or float2 types for vectorization of memory loads
// Consider increasing block size to maximize thread occupancy
// Prefetch data into registers to reduce memory latency
