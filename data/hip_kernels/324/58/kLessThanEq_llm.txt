```
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning data structures properly
// Use shared memory to store portions of mat1 and mat2 for faster access
// Consider unrolling the loop if supported by the hardware for performance gain
// Use memory prefetching techniques if len is large to reduce latency
// Optimize block size and grid size for maximum occupancy and performance
