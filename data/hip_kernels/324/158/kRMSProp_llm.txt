```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Load global memory data into shared memory to improve bandwidth utilization
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded into shared memory
// Perform operations using shared memory to increase computational efficiency
// Synchronize threads to ensure computation is complete before proceeding
// Write results back to global memory after computation
