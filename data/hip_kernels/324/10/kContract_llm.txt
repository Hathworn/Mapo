```
// Consider using shared memory to improve memory access patterns
// Align data access to coalesced memory for better bandwidth utilization
// Minimize divergent branches to increase warp efficiency
// Use loop unrolling to enhance throughput within the inner loop
// Evaluate the usage of atomics to see if they can be reduced or avoided
