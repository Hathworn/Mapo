```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce repeated global memory accesses
// Ensure data is accessed in a coalesced manner
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Consider prefetching data to hide memory latency
// Optimize memory access patterns to maximize cache usage
// Minimize divergence within the warp by ensuring uniform branching
