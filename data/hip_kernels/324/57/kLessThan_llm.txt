```
// Consider using shared memory if data reuse within the block is possible
// Ensure coalesced memory access for better global memory efficiency
// Minimizing branching could further improve performance
// Use __restrict__ pointers for pointer aliasing optimizations
// Investigate possible use of vectorized loads and stores for better memory bandwidth usage
