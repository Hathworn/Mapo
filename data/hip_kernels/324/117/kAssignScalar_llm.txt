// Consider coalescing memory accesses for the dest array
// Ensure that all threads in a warp write to consecutive memory locations
// Align data structures for optimal memory access patterns
// Utilize shared memory if applicable to reduce global memory access
// Explore unrolling loops if applicable for further performance gains
