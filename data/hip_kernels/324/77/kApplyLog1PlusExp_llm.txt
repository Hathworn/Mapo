```c
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure memory coalescing by aligning memory accesses for efficiency.
// Analyze bank conflicts when accessing shared memory.
// Leverage warp-level primitives to reduce divergence within warps.
// Tune block and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy.
// Adjust the size of blocks to match the memory transfer size.
// Consider using __ldg intrinsic for read-only data to optimize cache usage.
// Evaluate the use of loop unrolling to enhance pipeline efficiency.
