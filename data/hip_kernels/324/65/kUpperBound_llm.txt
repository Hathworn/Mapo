```
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced by aligning data structures
// Consider using shared memory to reduce frequent global memory accesses
// Utilize warp shuffle operations to further optimize parallel reductions
// Explore occupancy by adjusting block size to maximize resource usage
// Profile kernel to identify possible bank conflicts and address them
