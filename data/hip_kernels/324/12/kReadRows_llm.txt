```cpp
// Move calculations for offsets outside the loop to reduce repeated computations.
// Utilize shared memory to lower the latency of global memory access.
// Synchronize threads after loading data into shared memory to maintain data integrity.
// Load data from shared memory rather than global memory for improved access speed.
// Ensure synchronization of threads after each iteration to maintain loop consistency.
