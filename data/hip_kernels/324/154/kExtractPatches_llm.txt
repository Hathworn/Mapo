```
// Consider increasing block size for better occupancy
// Coalesce memory accesses to images array for improved memory throughput
// Ensure width_offset and height_offset are accessed in a coalesced manner
// Verify indices array is accessed in a coalesced pattern
// Use shared memory to store width_offset and height_offset for faster access
// Check if loop unrolling can be further optimized based on iteration count
