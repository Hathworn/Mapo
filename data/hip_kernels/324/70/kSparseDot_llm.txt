```
// Unroll inner loop to improve data access patterns and reduce loop overhead
// Use shared memory to cache dense_data for reuse within a block
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to dense_data for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Evaluate use of warp-level primitives for reduction in inner loop
// Opt for aligning data structures to avoid unaligned memory accesses
