// Avoid redundant calculations by computing thread index once
// Use constant memory or shared memory for frequently accessed data if possible for better memory access patterns
// Use coalesced memory access by ensuring threads read contiguous blocks of memory
// Reduce register pressure by optimizing loop variable initialization and calculations
// Consider loop unrolling if the iteration count is predictable and high
