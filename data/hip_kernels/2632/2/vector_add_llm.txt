// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for arrays a, b, out
// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data
// Minimize condition checks within the kernel
// Use loop unrolling if loops are present in the actual computation
// Optimize memory bandwidth by using aligned memory accesses
// Experiment with different block sizes for optimal performance
