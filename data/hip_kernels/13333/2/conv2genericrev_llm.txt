```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for input and kernel arrays
// Utilize padding to ensure aligned memory access, minimizing bank conflicts
// Optimize loop unrolling for the inner loop over kx to increase instruction-level parallelism
// Evaluate use of half-precision if accuracy permits to reduce bandwidth and increase performance
// Ensure proper use of shared memory to maximize occupancy and minimize memory latency
// Analyze register usage to avoid spilling over to local memory, reducing access time
