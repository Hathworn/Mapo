```cpp
// Ensure memory coalescing by checking data alignment
// Use __restrict__ keyword to suggest non-aliasing for pointer arguments
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize execution
// Use shared memory to store rows temporarily for better performance
// Prefetch min_in_rows into shared memory for faster access
// Combine atomic operations if possible to reduce overhead
```
