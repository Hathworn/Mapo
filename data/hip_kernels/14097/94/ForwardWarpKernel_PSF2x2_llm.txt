```
// Consider using shared memory to store src values to reduce global memory accesses.
// Precompute index offsets outside of conditionals to minimize repetitive calculations.
// Group atomicAdd operations to potentially improve performance by reducing contention.
// Consider using a different memory access pattern to coalesce reads from global memory.
