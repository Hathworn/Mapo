// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data arrays a and b
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring contiguous thread access patterns
// Avoid branch divergence by using uniform control flow
// Use fewer registers to reduce register pressure
// Ensure data alignment for vectorized memory operations
