```
// Unroll the loops to improve memory throughput and reduce loop overhead.
// Consider using shared memory for quadratic array to reduce global memory access.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced to minimize memory transactions.
// Use atomic operations where necessary to ensure correct updating of shared data.
