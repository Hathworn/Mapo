```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for lifter_coeffs and features arrays
// Use shared memory to store lifter coefficients for faster access among threads
// Ensure features array is accessed in a pattern that maximizes memory coalescing
// Consider implementing loop unrolling for the lifter application loop
// Review the usage of __syncthreads() to ensure optimal parallel execution
// Optimize the condition check for applying energy floor to minimize divergence
