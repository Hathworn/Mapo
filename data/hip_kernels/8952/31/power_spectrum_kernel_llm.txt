```
// Utilize shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider coalesced memory accesses when reading from A_in and writing to A_out
// Strive to align memory accesses to warp boundaries to improve efficiency
// Reduce branching by handling special cases outside the main loop if possible
// Ensure data structures are aligned to 128-bit boundaries for float2 reads
// Explore loop unrolling to increase instruction-level parallelism
