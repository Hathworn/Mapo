// Improve coalesced memory access by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations
// Leverage shared memory if possible to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure that INCX is 1 for optimal memory access pattern to maximize throughput
// Minimize warp divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
