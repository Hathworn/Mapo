```cpp
// Use loop unrolling to reduce the number of iterations and increase parallelism
// Optimize memory access using shared memory to reduce global memory traffic
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory by appropriate indexing
// Align memory accesses to coalesce global memory operations
```
