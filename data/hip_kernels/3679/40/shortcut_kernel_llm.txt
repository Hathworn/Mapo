// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where possible
// Employ memory coalescing to optimize memory bandwidth
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable to reduce loop overhead
// Minimize divergent branching to enhance warp execution efficiency
// Prefetch data into registers or shared memory to hide global memory latency
