```
// Consider using shared memory for `variance` and `mean` to reduce global memory access latency.
// Use `__restrict__` pointers for input arrays to enable enhanced compiler optimizations.
// Unroll the inner loop for spatial computations to improve ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism).
// Replace `powf(variance_val + .00001f, -1.5f)` with a precomputed or inline optimized operation.
// Employ vectorized memory access if data alignment allows for coalesced global memory reads.
// Minimize warp divergence by reordering the computation if possible.
