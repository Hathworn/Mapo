```
// Optimize access patterns to coalesce memory accesses where possible
// Consider using shared memory to store intermediate results for reduced global memory traffic
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to improve load efficiency
// Minimize redundant calculations by further reusing precomputed values where applicable
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce control overhead and increase arithmetic intensity
```
