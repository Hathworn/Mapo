// Consider using shared memory for caching frequently accessed data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align global memory accesses to improve memory coalescing if INCX is constant.
// Ensure ALPHA and INCX variables are loaded into registers to minimize latency.
// Investigate thread block size to ensure it aligns with GPU warp size for maximum efficiency.
// Use loop unrolling in the while loop to reduce instruction overhead.
