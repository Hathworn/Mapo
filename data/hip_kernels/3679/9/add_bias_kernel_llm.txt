```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for biases if they are reused frequently within a block
// Ensure coalesced memory access for the output array to improve memory bandwidth utilization
// Optimize grid and block dimensions for better occupancy and load balancing
// Pre-calculate and store reused values like (size * n) to reduce redundant computations in the loop
```
