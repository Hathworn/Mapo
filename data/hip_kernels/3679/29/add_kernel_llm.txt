// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
// Pre-fetch data into registers to minimize repeated global memory access
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous data locations when possible
// Optimize block and grid size for better work distribution and resource utilization
