```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Access data in a coalesced pattern to improve memory throughput
// Minimize branch divergence in warp execution
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by optimizing block size and grid size
// Prefetch data if possible to hide memory latency
