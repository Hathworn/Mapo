```
// Precompute scale to minimize redundant division operations
// Unroll loop to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses (if applicable)
// Use vectorized memory accesses to improve coalesced memory access patterns (if applicable)
// Consider loop transformation techniques to improve cache-reuse and reduce memory latency (if applicable)
