```
// Consider coalesced memory access for x and delta arrays to improve memory efficiency
// Minimize divergent branches in the for loops for better warp execution
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data blocks in x array to reduce global memory access
// Optimize loop unrolling for loops iterating over size to improve performance
