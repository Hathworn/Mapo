// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access
// Use shared memory to reduce redundant global memory loads
// Consider using float2 or float4 for loading and storing data to improve memory bandwidth
// Minimize divergent branches for better warp execution efficiency
// Ensure sufficient occupancy by adjusting block size with respect to available resources
