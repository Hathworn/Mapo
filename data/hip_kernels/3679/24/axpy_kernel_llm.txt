```
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Coalesced memory access for improved memory bandwidth utilization
// Align data accesses to memory boundaries for faster retrieval
// Minimize the number of redundant calculations within the loop
// Ensure grid and block dimensions are optimized for hardware
