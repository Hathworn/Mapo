```
// Combine blockIdx.y and gridDim.x with blockIdx.x for 1D grid implementation to maximize parallel execution
// Use local variable for accumulation to reduce global memory access overhead during summation
// Accumulate in local memory to minimize global memory traffic and improve access speed
// Set the mean after accumulation to ensure coherent access pattern for writing results
