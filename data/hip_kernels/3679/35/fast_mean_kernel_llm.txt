```c
// Improve memory coalescing by using contiguous memory access patterns
// Use atomic operations to reduce global memory writes
// Increase the size of shared memory to optimize memory usage
// Utilize warp-level primitives for a more efficient reduction within the block
// Minimize the number of __syncthreads() to reduce synchronization overhead
```
