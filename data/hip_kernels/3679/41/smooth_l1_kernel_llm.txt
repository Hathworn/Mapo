// Optimize global memory accesses by using shared memory if the data can be reused within the block
// Coalesce global memory accesses to reduce memory transaction overhead
// Minimize the usage of sqrt and fabs functions inside the kernel by pre-computations or other alternatives if applicable
// Ensure proper alignment of data structures to improve memory access speed
// Consider loop unrolling if applicable for further optimization
