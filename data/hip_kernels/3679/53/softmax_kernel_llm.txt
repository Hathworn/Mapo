// Optimize shared memory handling for better performance
// Reduce the number of atomic operations to minimize synchronization overhead
// Prefetch input data to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure all memory accesses are coalesced for increased throughput
// Consider using warp-level primitives for more efficient reduction
// Reuse shared memory to store intermediate results and minimize global memory accesses
