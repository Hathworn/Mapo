```
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism.
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve memory bandwidth utilization.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Perform reduction in shared memory to take advantage of faster access speeds compared to global memory.
// Minimize synchronization barriers to reduce thread divergence.
// Store the final reduction result in global memory using only a single thread within the block.
