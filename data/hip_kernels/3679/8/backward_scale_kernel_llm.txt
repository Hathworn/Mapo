// Consider prefetching data to shared memory to minimize global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data structure properly.
// Use shared memory efficiently to store frequently accessed data within block.
// Optimize loop to reduce thread divergence for better warp execution.
// Use parallel reduction in shared memory to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Implement atomic operations to avoid race conditions during scale_updates modifications.
