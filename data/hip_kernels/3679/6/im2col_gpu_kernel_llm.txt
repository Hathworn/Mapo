```
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access
// Consider loop unrolling for the inner loops to enhance performance
// Align memory access patterns to ensure coalesced memory access
// Preload data into registers where possible to minimize access latency
// Evaluate tiling strategy to improve data locality
// Implement balance between occupancy and resource usage for optimal performance
