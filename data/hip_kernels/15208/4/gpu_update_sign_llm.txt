```
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring sequential access to G and w
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage of G and w values to reduce global memory access
// Prefetch data into registers where possible to reduce repeated global memory reads
// Ensure neighbors array access patterns allow for optimal caching
// Use loop unrolling to increase throughput where the computation pattern allows
// Employ saturate_cast if precision allows to leverage fast math operations
