// Optimize: Use shared memory instead of global memory for frequent accesses to improve memory access speed.
// Optimize: Minimize conditional branches in the set_shared function to reduce divergence.
// Optimize: Align memory accesses to improve memory throughput.
// Optimize: Use contiguous memory allocation pattern to enable coalesced accesses.
// Optimize: Reduce unnecessary syncthreads calls to improve parallel efficiency.
// Optimize: Consider loop unrolling to improve computation efficiency.
// Optimize: Ensure shared memory is used efficiently to avoid bank conflicts.
// Optimize: Prefetch data into shared memory for use in subsequent calculations.
