// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data for faster computations.
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing repetitive results in registers.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
// Use loop unrolling to reduce loop control overhead and improve performance.
