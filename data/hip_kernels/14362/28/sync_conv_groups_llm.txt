// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for better performance
// Consider using shared memory to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Group threads with similar control paths to avoid divergence
// Minimize global memory accesses by caching values in registers where possible
// Align data structures to optimize memory transactions
