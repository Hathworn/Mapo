```
// Leverage shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern for ingrad, outgrad, and indata
// Consider thread block size that optimizes occupancy and memory throughput
// Avoid bank conflicts in shared memory use
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers if there are no aliasing issues
