// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Minimize atomic operations by accumulating results in shared memory first.
// Ensure proper initialization of shared memory to avoid race conditions.
// Consider unrolling loops if the number of colors (COLORS) is known and small.
// Align memory accesses to increase coalescing and reduce bank conflicts.
