```
// Use shared memory to store a portion of h_Src to reduce global memory access
// Use constant memory for h_Filter when it is read-only and small enough
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce overhead in the loop
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning memory accesses to cache line sizes
// Minimize divergent branches, especially within critical loops
