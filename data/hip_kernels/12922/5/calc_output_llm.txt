```
// Consider coalesced memory access for img_in and img_out.
// Ensure alignment to memory boundaries for img_in, img_out, and lut.
// Utilize shared memory for frequently accessed LUT entries to reduce global memory traffic.
// Minimize divergent branches by ensuring img_size is divisible by block dimensions.
