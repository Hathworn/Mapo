// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like LUT for faster access.
// Try to minimize divergent branches inside the kernel for better execution efficiency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for img_out and img_in for optimal bandwidth utilization.
// Evaluate using texture memory for read-only data like LUT to leverage caching benefits.
