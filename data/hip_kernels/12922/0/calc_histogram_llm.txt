```
// Consider coalesced memory access to optimize shared memory usage
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Use warp-level primitives to minimize the use of __syncthreads()
// Reduce the number of atomic operations to minimize contention
// Carefully manage shared memory initialization to avoid warp divergence
