```c
// Consider using shared memory to cache h_Src data to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for h_Src and h_Dst arrays.
// Minimize bank conflicts when using shared memory.
// Assess the occupancy rate of the kernel and adjust block dimensions for optimal performance.
