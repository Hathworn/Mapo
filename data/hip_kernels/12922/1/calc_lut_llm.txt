```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for 'lut' writes.
// Use shared memory efficiently by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Do not compute cdf directly in global memory to reduce latency.
// Ensure atomic operations are used properly to minimize serialization.
// Evaluate early exit conditions carefully to avoid unnecessary computations.
// Consider loop unrolling for the prefix sum computation where possible.
