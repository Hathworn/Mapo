```
// Consider using shared memory for reusing data within a block
// Implement coalesced memory accesses for better data throughput
// Unroll loops if applicable to reduce loop overhead and increase performance
// Use appropriate block and grid sizes to ensure high occupancy and efficient execution
// Check memory alignment and access patterns to prevent unaligned accesses
