```
// Use shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency
// Consider loop unrolling to increase performance through instruction-level parallelism
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing and reduce memory transaction overhead
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to maintain warp efficiency
