```c
// Optimize shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring data access patterns avoid conflicts
// Consider increasing block size if it improves occupancy and reduces global memory transactions
// Utilize __restrict__ to provide compiler additional information to optimize memory access
// Experiment with loop unrolling if applicable for better instruction throughput
// Analyze memory access pattern for coalescing opportunities
```
