```
// Optimize memory access patterns to improve coalescing
// Consider further optimizing shared memory usage to minimize bank conflicts
// Use const qualifiers for read-only data to allow compiler optimizations
// Evaluate if reducing shared memory size impacts performance positively
// Double-check loop unrolling effectiveness for this specific context
// Try different block and grid sizes for possible occupancy improvements
