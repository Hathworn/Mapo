```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Align data accesses to warp size to optimize memory transactions.
// Coalesce global memory accesses to improve throughput.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel for better performance.
// Preload frequently accessed data into registers to speed up computation.
// Ensure memory access patterns allow for effective caching.
