// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Consider potential bank conflicts in shared memory access
// Minimize condition checks within the kernel for better warp efficiency
// Optimize thread synchronization to prevent unnecessary __syncthreads() usage
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for global memory operations
