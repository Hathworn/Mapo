```
// Use coalesced memory access for input reads to improve memory efficiency
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to minimize synchronization overhead
// Optimize shared memory usage by dynamically allocating it based on block size
// Evaluate occupancy and adjust block size or grid size accordingly for better performance
