```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Consider unrolling the loop to improve performance
// Use __restrict__ qualifier for pointers to increase compiler optimization
// Implement memory coalescing by ensuring data alignment
// Use warp-level primitives to reduce divergence and improve efficiency
