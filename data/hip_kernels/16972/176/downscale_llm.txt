```
// Unrolling the inner loop can enhance instruction level parallelism
// Use __restrict__ keyword to suggest that memory pointers do not overlap
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for better coalescing
// Ensure the grid and block dimensions maximize occupancy
// Use shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory traffic
