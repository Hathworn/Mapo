```c
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access neighboring input data
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning input and output memory
// Reduce arithmetic operations by calculating pixel values outside the loop if possible
// Use loop unrolling for handling multiple pixels per thread for better utilization
// Minimize memory divergence by ensuring contiguous thread blocks access contiguous memory
// Analyze occupancy and ensure the block size is optimal for the compute capability
