```
// Ensure shared memory initialization is done by a single warp to minimize divergence.
// Use __syncthreads() after initializing shared memory to ensure all threads proceed together.
// Accumulate counts in shared memory first to reduce global memory accesses.
// Write back to global memory from shared memory in a coalesced manner.
