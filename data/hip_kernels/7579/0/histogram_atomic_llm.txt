```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access.
// Aggregate partial results in shared memory before updating global memory.
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing.
// Ensure the input data is aligned for optimal access patterns.
// Minimize divergent branching in the kernel.
// Explore using warp-level primitives to further optimize reduction.
