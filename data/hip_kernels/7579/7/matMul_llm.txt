```cpp
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Ensure coalesced memory access for matrices a and b
// Increase block size for better utilization of CUDA cores
// Consider using loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
// Align data structures to cache line size to improve performance
```
