```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading into shared memory
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after computation
// Load elements into shared memory in tiles to optimize memory coalescing
// Ensure all shared memory accesses are complete before proceeding
