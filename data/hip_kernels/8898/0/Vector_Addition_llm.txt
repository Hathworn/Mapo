```
// Use shared memory for repeated data access to reduce global memory transactions
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures optimally
// Experiment with different block sizes to find optimal performance for target hardware
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads within a warp follow the same execution path
