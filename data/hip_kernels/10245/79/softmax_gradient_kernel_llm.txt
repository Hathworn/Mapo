```
// Consider using __restrict__ qualifiers for pointer parameters to improve memory access efficiency
// Use more efficient memory access patterns, such as coalesced memory access
// Align shared memory usage to ensure optimal memory transactions
// Ensure that the amount of shared memory does not exceed hardware capabilities
// Consider unrolling the loop to improve instruction throughput, if applicable
