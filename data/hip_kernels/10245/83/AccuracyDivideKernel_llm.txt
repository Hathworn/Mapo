// Ensure that *accuracy is read from global memory before use
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads need to access the value of *accuracy
// Use synchronization if moving to shared memory or if multiple threads write to *accuracy in the future
// Verify if atomic operations are required if *accuracy is updated by multiple threads in other scenarios
