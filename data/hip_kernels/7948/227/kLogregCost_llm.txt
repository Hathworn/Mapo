// Research use of __ldg() to optimize global memory access for read-heavy operations.
// Investigate shared memory as a way to reduce redundant access to global memory.
// Evaluate the benefit of loop unrolling further to minimize iteration overhead.
// Consider using warp shuffle operations to reduce the number of atomic operations.
