```c
// Reduce shared memory access by using a local variable for summation
// Process elements across grid instead of block for better load balancing
// Use __syncthreads to ensure all updates to shared memory are completed
// Minimize warp divergence in reduction using warp-level primitives
// Ensure memory coalescing by accessing contiguous memory locations
// Write the block's result to global memory only once per block
```
