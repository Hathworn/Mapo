```c
// Consider coalescing reads from src to optimize memory access patterns
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access if appropriate
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by aligning loop iterations with warp size
// Implement loop unrolling if it benefits GPU computation efficiency
// Consider adjusting block size and grid size for optimal occupancy
```
