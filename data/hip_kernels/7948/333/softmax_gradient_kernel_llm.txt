```
// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to reduce thread divergence and synchronization overhead.
// Use float4 or other vector types to load multiple elements at once to improve memory throughput.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for the input Y and dY arrays to enhance memory access efficiency.
// If possible, use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data to reduce global memory reads.
