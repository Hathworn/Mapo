// Use shared memory to cache data accessed by multiple threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Align global memory accesses to ensure coalescence for improved memory bandwidth.
// Avoid redundant computations for bounds checking by computing them outside the nested loops.
// Reuse intermediate computation results within the kernel to minimize redundant calculations.
// Minimize divergent branches related to boundary checks by re-structuring the logic.
