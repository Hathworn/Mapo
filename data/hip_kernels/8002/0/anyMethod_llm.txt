```
// Combine reads for sequential memory accesses into fewer transactions to minimize global memory bandwidth
// Consider using shared memory to reduce the number of redundant global memory accesses
// Unroll loops to increase instruction-level parallelism and reduce control overhead
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to optimize global memory throughput
// Prefetch data to reduce latency and improve cache utilization where possible
