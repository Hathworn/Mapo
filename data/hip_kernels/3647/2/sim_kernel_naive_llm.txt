```cpp
// Consider using shared memory for temporary storage to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns by aligning data structures
// Use loop unrolling for operations on neighboring elements if applicable
// Balance workload across threads by adapting block and grid sizes
// Minimize divergent branches by structuring conditionals carefully
// Prefetch data into registers to further reduce memory access latency
```
