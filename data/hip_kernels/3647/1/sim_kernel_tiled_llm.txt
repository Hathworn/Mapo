// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access, particularly for the z_tile array.
// Ensure all shared memory loads are before __syncthreads() to optimize synchronization.
// Minimize boundary checks using logical conditions to reduce divergence within warp execution.
// Consider padding shared memory allocation to avoid bank conflicts.
