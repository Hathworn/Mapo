```cpp
// Consider aligning memory accesses for double-precision data (e.g., using double2)
// Use __ldg() for potentially caching read-only data like z_min and z_max on newer architectures
// Consider optimizing the stride based on hardware occupancy and warp size
// Ensure shared memory does not exceed the per-block limit
// Use more shared memory or registers to store frequently accessed values
// Reduce branching by using arithmetic operations if possible
// Make use of the fma() function to improve floating-point operations
