```
// Consider optimizing memory access patterns for coalesced access.
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access if applicable.
// Align data structures to memory boundaries for improved access speeds.
// Minimize divergent branching within the kernel for better performance.
// Ensure optimal block size for maximum occupancy and efficiency.
// Prefetch data to reduce memory latency where possible.
