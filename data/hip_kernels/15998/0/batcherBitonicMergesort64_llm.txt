```c
// Consider using memory coalescing techniques for d_in and d_out accesses
// Ensure shared memory usage is optimized to reduce bank conflicts in sdata
// Investigate reducing the number of __syncthreads calls for performance gains
// Minimize divergent branches in condition checks for better warp execution
