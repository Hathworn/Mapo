```c
// Ensure memory access is coalesced by checking memory alignment
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access
// Optimize for memory bandwidth by minimizing atomic operations when possible
// Explore loop unrolling if BIN_COUNT is small and known at compile time
// Ensure d_in and d_bins are allocated with cudaMallocManaged or similar for optimal performance
```
