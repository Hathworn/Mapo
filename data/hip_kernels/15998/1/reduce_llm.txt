```
// Use warp-level intrinsics to reduce synchronization overhead.
// Ensure input data is coalesced to improve memory access efficiency.
// Minimize usage of __syncthreads() by leveraging warp-level reduction.
// Optimize shared memory usage by reusing it across different reduction stages.
// Align shared memory allocation to avoid bank conflicts.
// Consider using __shfl_down_sync instead of manual index calculations for warp shuffle operations.
