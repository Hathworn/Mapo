```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses to improve bandwidth.
// Minimize synchronization calls if possible to reduce overhead.
// Optimize the reduction loop to minimize bank conflicts in shared memory access.
// Ensure that the number of threads is a power of two for efficient reduction.
// Adjust shared memory usage to fit within hardware constraints for better performance.
