// Consider using shared memory to store frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access for d_in by organizing threads such that adjacent threads read adjacent memory locations.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() by reorganizing computations to reduce overhead and improve performance.
