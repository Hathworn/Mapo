```cpp
// Use coalesced memory accesses by utilizing contiguous sequence of threads for each block
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts by ensuring proper memory access patterns
// Consider adjusting BLOCK_WIDTH to match the GPU's warp size for optimal performance
// Avoid excessive usage of __syncthreads() to improve performance, only use when necessary
```
