```cpp
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to improve read efficiency from d_in
// Consider minimizing bank conflicts in shared memory access by optimizing stride
// Initialize shared memory with warp-level primitives to increase efficiency
// Leverage warp synchronous programming techniques for better performance
// Prefer atomic operations on d_total if blocks can be parallelized further
```
