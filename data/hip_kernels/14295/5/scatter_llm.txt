```
// Prefetch d_zerosPredicate and d_onesPredicate for memory access reduction
// Use shared memory for intermediate computations to reduce global memory access
// Coalesced memory accesses to improve throughput
// Ensure memory access patterns are sequential to utilize hardware efficiently
// Consider using warp shuffle instructions for efficient data transfer
