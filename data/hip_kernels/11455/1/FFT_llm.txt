```c
// Consider using shared memory to store R and I for faster access within a block
// Pre-compute and store trigonometric values in shared memory for reuse
// Minimize divergent branching by restructuring loop divisions
// Align memory accesses to coalesced patterns for R and I arrays
// Use loop unrolling for the computation loop to increase arithmetic throughput
