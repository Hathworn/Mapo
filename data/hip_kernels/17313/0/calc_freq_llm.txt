```
// Ensure shared memory is efficiently used by minimizing memory bank conflicts
// Use coalesced memory access patterns when accessing the buffer array
// Minimize use of atomic operations if possible, as they can serialize execution
// Consider loop unrolling for the frequency calculation to enhance performance
// Explore double-buffering or cache strategies to improve memory access speed
