```c
// Use shared memory to cache image data to minimize global memory access
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring data layout is aligned for the warp
// Employ loop unrolling if applicable to reduce instruction overhead
// Consider using texture memory for read-only data access for potential caching benefits
```
