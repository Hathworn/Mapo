```
// Consider using shared memory for spatial locality to reduce global memory access
// Ensure coalesced memory access pattern by aligning memory accesses across threads
// Perform loop unrolling based on 'dim' only if it significantly impacts performance
// Utilize a memory prefetching technique to minimize latency in memory access
// Evaluate potential warp divergence in boundary condition checks and optimize
// Explore adjusting grid and block size for better occupancy and memory bandwidth
