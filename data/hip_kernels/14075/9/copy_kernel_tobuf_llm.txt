```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access and increase memory bandwidth.
// Align data access to memory boundaries to improve coalesced memory access.
// Implement memory prefetching techniques to hide memory latency.
// Evaluate the use of half-precision or other lower precision arithmetic for type_size to improve performance on supported hardware.
// Consider using asynchronous memory copy operations if applicable and beneficial.
