```
// Avoid recalculating indices by computing them once at the beginning
// Use a single combined condition to reduce the number of evaluations
// Pre-calculate offsets for destination and source for improved efficiency
// Move pointers outside the loop to avoid repeated computation
// Utilize efficient memory copy functions to accelerate data transfer
// Adjust the destination pointer once per dimension iteration
