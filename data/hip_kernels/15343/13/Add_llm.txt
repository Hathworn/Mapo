```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses by ensuring a, b, and c are allocated in contiguous memory.
// Use shared memory to store elements of a and b to reduce global memory access latency.
// Optimize thread and block configuration to improve occupancy and parallel efficiency.
// Ensure memory accesses are aligned to reduce memory access overhead.
