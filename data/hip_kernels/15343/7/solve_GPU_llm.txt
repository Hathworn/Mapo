```
// Precompute repeated operations outside the loop to save resources
// Use temporary variables to store results and avoid recalculating
// Optimize memory access by using faster shared memory for intermediate values if applicable
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for improved bandwidth usage
// Leverage instruction-level parallelism with independent calculations
