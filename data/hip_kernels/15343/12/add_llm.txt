```cpp
// Consider coalesced global memory access when loading A into shared memory
// Ensure __syncthreads() is used after tile is updated for proper synchronization
// Optimize boundary condition checks to minimize warp divergence
// Minimize redundant calculations by storing indices in variables if repeatedly accessed
```
