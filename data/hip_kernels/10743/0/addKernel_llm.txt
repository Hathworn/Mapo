```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses for optimal performance.
// Utilize registers to temporarily store frequently accessed data.
// Avoid global memory writes when not necessary to save bandwidth.
// Adjust grid and block dimensions to fit the dataset for efficient utilization.
// Evaluate the possibility of using vector types for a[i] and b[i] to optimize loads.
