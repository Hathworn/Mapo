// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses
// Use warp-level primitives to optimize reduction operations if applicable
// Explore the use of prefetching to improve data loading efficiency
