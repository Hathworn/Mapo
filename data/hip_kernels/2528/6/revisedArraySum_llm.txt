// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize reduction computation.
// Reduce memory divergence by coalescing global memory writes.
// Use multiple blocks to sum larger arrays and reduce block-level synchronization overhead.
// Ensure memory access patterns are coalesced for better memory bandwidth utilization.
// Explore using atomic operations for reduction across multiple blocks.
