// Consider using shared memory to cache elements for reuse
// Use coalesced memory access patterns to enhance memory throughput
// Minimize divergent branches in warp execution to improve performance
// Ensure alignment of data for efficient memory transactions
// Optimize block and grid sizes to maximize occupancy and minimize idle threads
