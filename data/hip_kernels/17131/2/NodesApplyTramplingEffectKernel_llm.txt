// Combine global memory reads for distanceToPath and pathThickness to coalesce memory access
// Consider using shared memory to cache distanceToPath values for the block
// Ensure atomicAdd is justified due to potential contention from multiple threads
// Align data structures to ensure memory access is within a single transaction when possible
