```
// Add memory coalescing by ensuring that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations to optimize memory throughput.
// Consider using shared memory if there are data dependencies or if reusing data manipulated by threads to reduce global memory accesses.
// Check if the data can be loaded using vectorized memory access for better performance in certain data layouts or use cases.
// Implement loop unrolling if applicable to promote instruction-level parallelism and improve throughput.
