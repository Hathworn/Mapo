```cpp
// Pre-calculate indices to minimize repeated calculations inside loops
// Use pitched memory wisely to align data for better memory access
// Load data once into registers to reduce global memory access times
// Use shared memory if multiple threads access the same data repeatedly
// Store results back to global memory only after processing is complete
// Consider using shared memory to store pre-calculated values, like txx2 and tyy2
// Minimize recalculating invariant values during kernel execution
