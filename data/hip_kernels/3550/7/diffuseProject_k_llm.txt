```c
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for vx and vy for improved memory throughput.
// Implement shared memory tiling for vx and vy to reduce global memory accesses.
// Evaluate loop unrolling for the p-loop to enhance performance.
// Explore the use of vectorized loads/stores for float2 elements to utilize memory bandwidth effectively.
// Analyze possible rearrangement of computations to maximize instruction-level parallelism.
