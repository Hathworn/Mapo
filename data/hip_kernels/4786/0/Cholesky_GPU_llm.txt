```
// Consider coalesced memory access patterns for the initial loading into shared memory.
// Evaluate the use of texture memory for read-only data to potentially increase performance.
// Ensure that the number of threads per block is a multiple of warp size for optimal performance.
// Minimize the use of __syncthreads() as frequent synchronization may affect performance.
// Consider loop unrolling for the innermost computation loop to maximize throughput.
// Use a faster mathematical library function if available, such as hipblas for specialized operations.
