```
// Ensure coalesced memory access by accessing X, v, and b in a pattern that groups consecutive threads on consecutive memory locations.
// Reduce divergent branches by ensuring each thread in a warp follows the same control flow.
// Consider using shared memory to cache frequently accessed data like normalization factors if there's enough shared memory availability.
// Minimize memory transactions by ensuring v[col] and b[col] are loaded once per column and reused.
