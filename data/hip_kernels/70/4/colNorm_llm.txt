```
// Consider coalesced memory access by ensuring X and v are accessed in a contiguous manner.
// Optimize memory access patterns by using shared memory if there are frequent accesses to v[col].
// Ensure grid and block sizes are optimal for the GPU architecture being targeted.
// Minimize warp divergence by aligning the iteration strategy with warp execution.
