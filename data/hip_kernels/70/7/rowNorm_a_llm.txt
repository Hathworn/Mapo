```c
// Use shared memory to store v and a for better memory access patterns
// Consider coalesced memory access for X to optimize memory bandwidth
// Try loop unrolling to minimize loop overhead
// Use __restrict__ keyword if pointers do not alias for better optimization
// Consider using texture memory if v and a have spatial locality
```
