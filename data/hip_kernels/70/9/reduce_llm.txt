```
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for improved performance.
// Use a larger stride to reduce thread divergence and increase instruction throughput.
// Avoid shared memory bank conflicts by careful data placement and access patterns.
// Utilize loop unrolling in the reduction stages to minimize branch divergence.
// Ensure warp-synchronization to reduce unnecessary barrier synchronizations.
// Minimize register usage to accommodate more concurrent threads and blocks.
