```
// Suggest using loop unrolling in both shared memory loading and computation to minimize loop overhead.
// Ensure shared memory accesses are coalesced for better memory performance.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after loading shared memory for preventing race conditions.
// Consider using larger tile size if shared memory usage is not a bottleneck.
// Verify that all memory accesses are aligned to improve memory coalescing.
