```
// Improve memory coalescing by ensuring threads access consecutive elements in global memory.
// Use loop unrolling to optimize the inner loop for better performance.
// Reduce global memory accesses by loading redundant or shared data only once per tile.
// Consider increasing TILE_SIZE for better compute and memory utilization, if occupancy allows.
// Check if accessing a or b matrices goes beyond boundaries and add boundary checks only if necessary.
