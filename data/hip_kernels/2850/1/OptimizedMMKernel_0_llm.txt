```cpp
// Consider improving shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts.
// Make sure that memory access patterns are coalesced for global memory loads.
// Optimize `__syncthreads()` usage to ensure threads are synchronized efficiently.
// Investigate using warp-level primitives to reduce synchronization overhead.
