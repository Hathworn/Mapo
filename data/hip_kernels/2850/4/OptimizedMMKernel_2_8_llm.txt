```cpp
// Use shared memory to improve memory access patterns
// Ensure coalesced global memory access when loading data into shared memory
// Unroll loops to reduce overhead and increase instruction-level parallelism
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads before accessing shared memory
// Optimize for multiple blocks per GPU using the tile size
// Ensure that data is accessed in a row-major order for contiguous memory access
// Consider increasing block size to fully utilize computational resources
// Remove bank conflicts in shared memory by adjusting indexing if necessary
