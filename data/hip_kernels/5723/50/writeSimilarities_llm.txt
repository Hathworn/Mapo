```
// Consider coalesced memory access for nvccResults and activelayers arrays
// Ensure optimal memory access patterns to reduce global memory transactions
// Use shared memory if possible to reduce repeated global memory reads
// Align and pad data structures to avoid bank conflicts
// Optimize loop unrolling for the writenum loop to improve throughput
