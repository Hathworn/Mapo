```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses if the operation can benefit from data reuse.
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize memory access patterns and reduce divergence.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by verifying that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
// Evaluate if using pinned memory can reduce data transfer latency between host and device.
