```
// Consider using shared memory for commonly accessed data to reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data structures in a way that groups threads access contiguous memory.
// Explore launching more threads or increasing thread block size to better utilize GPU resources.
// Apply loop unrolling for the loop inside the kernel, if applicable, for further optimization.
