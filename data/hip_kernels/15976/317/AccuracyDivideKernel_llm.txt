// Consider using warp-level primitives for reduction to optimize memory access
// Use `atomicAdd` on global memory cautiously as it may lead to performance bottlenecks
// Use shared memory efficiently to minimize global memory access
// Avoid bank conflicts by aligning shared memory accesses
// Evaluate if `atomicAdd` can be replaced by more efficient reduction techniques
