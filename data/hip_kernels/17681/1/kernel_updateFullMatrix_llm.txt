```
// Consider coalesced memory accesses for arrays B, V, Cm, Em, and Rm.
// Use __restrict__ qualifiers to enable better compiler optimizations.
// Ensure data is accessed in a way that maximizes cache utilization.
// Evaluate the alignment of data structures to ensure 16-byte alignment for better performance.
// Investigate potential benefits of using shared memory for frequently accessed data.
