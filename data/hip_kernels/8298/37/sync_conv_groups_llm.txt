// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads/writes
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory usage
// Implement use of constant memory for frequently accessed data
// Ensure __syncthreads() is synchronized for all threads in a block
