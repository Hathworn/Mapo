```c
// Consider using shared memory if the data size and access pattern benefit from it.
// Ensure coalesced global memory access for threads within a warp.
// Reduce the use of atomic operations for cases where multiple threads need to write to the same memory location.
// Optimize data transfer between host and device by minimizing transfer frequency and only transferring necessary data.
// Explore using streams for overlapping data transfers with computation to improve concurrency.
// Profile memory usage and access patterns to ensure maximum throughput and efficiency.
