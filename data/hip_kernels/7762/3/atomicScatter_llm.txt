// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Consider using texture memory for frequent read access patterns
// Minimize bank conflicts in shared memory accesses
// Unroll loops for small iteration counts to decrease overhead
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed constant values
// Align memory accesses to 128 bytes for better performance
// Avoid redundant calculations by storing results in local variables
