```
// Consider using shared memory for data that is accessed frequently by threads to reduce global memory access latency.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring that contiguous threads access contiguous memory locations.
// Evaluate the use of warp shuffles for inter-thread communication to minimize memory access overhead.
// Examine using asynchronous memory transfers to overlap computation with data movement.
// Optimize memory usage by using appropriate data types to match the precision requirements of the algorithm.
// Leverage constant memory for data that remains unchanged during kernel execution to reduce memory traffic.
