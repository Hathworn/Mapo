// Use __restrict__ pointers to hint at potential memory access optimizations  
// Minimize global memory accesses by ensuring that the computation is done directly in registers  
// Align memory accesses to improve coalescing  
// Check if shared memory usage can reduce redundant global memory accesses  
// Consider loop unrolling for small data sizes to reduce overhead
