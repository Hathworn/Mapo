```
// Consider increasing BLOCK_SIZE to leverage higher computational capacity if hardware supports it.
// Ensure appropriate use of __syncthreads() to avoid race conditions while accessing shared memory.
// Flatten memory accesses to global arrays A and B to improve memory coalescing.
// Minimize bank conflicts when accessing shared memory by adjusting array indices if possible.
// Ensure the matrices' dimensions are optimal for the chosen BLOCK_SIZE to maximize occupancy.
