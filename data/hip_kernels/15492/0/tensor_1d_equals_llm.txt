```
// Use the __restrict__ keyword to improve compiler optimization by indicating pointers do not alias
// Ensure data alignment for better memory access performance
// Consider using shared memory for elements that are accessed repeatedly
// Minimize divergence by ensuring all threads in a warp follow the same execution path
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable for repeated operations
// Optimize stride to ensure coalesced global memory access
// If eq_flag being incremented is a frequent operation across threads, evaluate alternative synchronization methods
// Review the block and grid dimensions for optimal occupancy and throughput
