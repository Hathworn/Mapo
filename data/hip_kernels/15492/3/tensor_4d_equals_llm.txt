```
// Consider using a memory coalescing strategy to optimize global memory access
// Increase data locality by accessing contiguous memory regions in the loop
// Use loop unrolling to enhance performance by reducing loop overhead
// Prefetch data into shared memory to further reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy and minimize warp divergence
