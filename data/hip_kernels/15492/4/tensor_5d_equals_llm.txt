```c
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for x and y arrays
// Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data
// Avoid branch divergence by rearranging the control flow
// Minimize global memory access by calculating indices efficiently
// Consider loop unrolling to reduce loop overhead
```
