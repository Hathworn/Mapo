```
// Consider using shared memory to minimize redundant global memory accesses for x and y.
// Ensure data coalescing in global memory access for x and y to optimize memory throughput.
// Utilize warp-level primitives to increase efficiency of conditional checks.
// Investigate potential for loop unrolling if checks are repetitive.
// Explore if using register memory can be more efficient for specific variables.
