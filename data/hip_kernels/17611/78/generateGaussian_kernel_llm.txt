```cpp
// Consider using shared memory to cache data and reduce global memory access latency.
// Ensure proper memory coalescing by aligning data structures in memory.
// Check for bank conflicts and optimize shared memory access patterns.
// Utilize prefetched data to hide global memory latency.
// Maximize the occupancy by adjusting block size and resource usage.
// Apply loop unrolling if applicable to increase instruction-level parallelism.
