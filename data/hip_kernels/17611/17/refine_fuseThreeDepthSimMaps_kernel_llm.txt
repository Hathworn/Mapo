```
// Consider coalescing memory accesses to improve memory throughput
// Align data structures to ensure efficient memory transactions
// Utilize shared memory to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize conditional checks within the inner loop for performance
// Ensure kernel launch parameters are optimized for the target hardware
// Prefetch data to registers when beneficial for loop operations
