// Consider coalesced access for isims and idpts to improve global memory access efficiency.
// Ensure alignment of output buffers osim and odpt to guarantee optimal memory transactions.
// Utilize shared memory to cache neighboring elements, reducing redundant global memory accesses.
// Assess the occupancy level and maximize the use of available registers to improve performance.
// Minimize divergent branches within the kernel to ensure warp execution efficiency.
// Evaluate tiling strategies for processing data in blocks for potential performance benefits.
