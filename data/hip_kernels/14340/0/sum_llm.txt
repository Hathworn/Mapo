// Consider coalesced memory access in the global memory read operation
// Optimize shared memory usage by minimizing bank conflicts
// Align shared memory access pattern for efficient data transfer
// Use warp-uniform operations to reduce synchronization overhead
// Check if using atomic operations is necessary instead of intra-warp communication
// Load balancing across threads to optimize resource usage
// Ensure memory writes to global memory are coalesced
