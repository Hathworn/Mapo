// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Load and clamp data using ternary operators to minimize branch instructions
// Ensure threads are synchronized after loading data into shared memory
// Avoid out-of-bounds writes by checking thread index against block size
// Balance workload by adjusting thread block size and grid configuration
