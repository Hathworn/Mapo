```
// Use shared memory to cache minmax values for improved data access speed.
// Avoid bank conflicts when accessing shared memory by ensuring proper alignment.
// Consider loop unrolling for the k-loop to reduce loop overhead and improve performance.
// Coalesce global memory accesses by ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations in ptrs.
// Use __syncthreads() to synchronize threads after updating shared memory to avoid race conditions.
