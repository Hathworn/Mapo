// Use shared memory efficiently by loading data in parallel to reduce global memory accesses.
// Unroll loops where applicable to enhance parallel execution and reduce loop overhead.
// Minimize conditional checks inside loops to improve execution efficiency.
// Consider data alignment and padding for efficient memory coalescing.
// Utilize `atomicAdd` effectively for histogram reduction to prevent race conditions.
// Fully utilize thread synchronization with `__syncthreads()` where data dependency exists.
