```
// Use shared memory to cache data for fast access and minimize global memory reads
// Ensure correct boundaries to avoid reading out-of-bounds memory
// Preload data outside the loop to reduce redundant memory accesses
// Minimize thread divergence by combining conditions
// Rotate memory positions in shared memory to optimize access patterns
// Optimize synchronization to ensure correct data dependency resolution
