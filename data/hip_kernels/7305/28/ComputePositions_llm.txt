```
// Consider using shared memory to load neighboring elements rather than repeated calls to __ldg() to reduce global memory traffic.
// Ensure coalesced access pattern for loading data into registers.
// Verify that preloaded values can be stored in registers effectively to minimize redundant use of global memory.
// Address thread divergence in "if" statements to improve warp efficiency.
// Explore loop unrolling techniques in case of repetitive patterns for better performance.
// Optimize calculation of pdx, pdy, and pds by avoiding division operations or replacing them with reciprocal multiplication where possible.
// Reassess the conditions for fallback computation of pdx, pdy, pds to enhance control flow consistency.
// Evaluate the potential use of warp shuffle instructions for inter-thread data sharing.
// Prioritize constraints that can simplify the determinant calculation and reduce arithmetic operations.
