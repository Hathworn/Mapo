```
// Consider using coalesced memory access patterns for d_Data reads to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Shared memory accesses are aligned; ensure that this pattern is preserved for new optimizations.
// Ensure that reduction step variables and conditions are correctly handling block synchronization.
// Verify if the shared memory arrays could be reduced or optimized based on actual thread utilization.
// Explore double buffering if applicable, to overlap computation and memory loads.
