```
// Consider using shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Align memory accesses to 64 bytes for optimal coalescing
// Unroll loops to increase instruction throughput
// Use warp-level primitives for synchronization instead of __syncthreads
// Check for bank conflicts in shared memory access patterns
