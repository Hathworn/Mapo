```
// Consider using loop unrolling for the convolution computation loop for better performance.
// Ensure coalesced memory access by aligning data in shared memory properly.
// Minimize shared memory bank conflicts when accessing sdata.
// Try to use the const __restrict__ qualifier for read-only memory pointers to optimize memory access.
// Consider increasing the number of threads per block to better hide memory latency.
// Evaluate using asynchronous copy to leverage parallel memory access and computation.
