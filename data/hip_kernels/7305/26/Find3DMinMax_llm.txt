```
// Use shared memory for data caching to reduce global memory access latency
// Minimize redundant calculations by caching values in thread registers
// Perform clamped boundary checks to avoid out-of-bounds memory access
// Optimize memory access patterns to ensure coalesced reads and writes
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure proper synchronization between threads
// Reduce conditional branching to optimize execution flow   
// Use constant memory for frequently accessed data to optimize memory bandwidth
