// Optimize shared memory usage by reducing size if possible.
// Consider merging multiple __syncthreads() calls to reduce overhead.
// Use memory coalescing when loading g_Data to shared memory.
// Investigate padding in shared memory or aligning variable access for better performance.
// Precompute values like i2sigma2 outside loop if reused frequently.
// Ensure atomicAdd operations are the most efficient approach to update hist array.
