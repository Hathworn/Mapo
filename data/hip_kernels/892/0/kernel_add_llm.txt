// Consider using shared memory for frequently accessed data to reduce global memory access latency
// Optimize memory coalescing by ensuring threads access contiguous memory locations
// Evaluate using loop unrolling to improve instruction throughput
// Assess warp divergence and align memory access pattern accordingly
