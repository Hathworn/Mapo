```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.
// Ensure coalesced memory access patterns for loading data into shared memory.
// Perform boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds memory accesses.
// Synchronize threads to ensure all data is loaded before computation.
// Optimize the loop to improve data reuse within shared memory.
// Store final results only after confirming valid thread computation.
