```cpp
// Use shared memory to store tiles for efficient data reuse
// Load tiles efficiently to optimize memory access patterns
// Consider coalescing global memory accesses for d_a and d_b
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have finished loading tiles
// Unroll loops to improve performance by reducing loop overhead
// Write back the result conditionally if the indices are within bounds
```
