```cpp
// Use registers to cache frequently used variables to reduce global memory accesses
// Minimize mathematical operations within the kernel to enhance computational efficiency
// Precompute scale factors outside of loops when possible to save computation inside the kernel
// Use the min-max clamp functions to ensure weight calculations are bounded correctly
// Combine texture fetching results immediately to reduce the need for intermediate storage
// Ensure coalesced memory accesses by aligning data access patterns with warp threads
