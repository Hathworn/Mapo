```
// Ensure coalesced memory access to improve bandwidth utilization.
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses where beneficial.
// Minimize use of atomic operations by aggregating updates in shared memory, if possible.
// Leverage texture caching efficiently to reduce latency in memory operations.
