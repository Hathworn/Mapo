```
// Optimize memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced memory access for global reads and writes
// Consider using shared memory for intermediate storage to reduce global memory access latency
// Utilize the texture cache effectively for accessing source images
// Ensure alignment of the destination buffer to improve memory access efficiency
// Evaluate the usage of half precision or reduce precision requirements to optimize bandwidth utilization
