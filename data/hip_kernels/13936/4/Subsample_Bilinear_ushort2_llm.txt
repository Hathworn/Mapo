```
// Use fast division for hscale and vscale to improve performance.
// Precompute wh and wv using fused multiply-add for accuracy.
// Use clamp operation to ensure wh and wv remain within bounds.
// Optimize bilinear interpolation using texture fetches for coalesced memory access.
// Favor integer arithmetic in averaging to reduce computation overhead.
