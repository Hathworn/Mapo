```
// Use shared memory to cache histogram updates and reduce global memory accesses.
// Coalesce global memory writes by using warp-wide aggregation for histogram updates.
// Optimize texture memory access pattern to improve cache hit rate.
// Implement warps to handle multiple pixels to increase parallelism and reduce divergence.
// Consider using larger block sizes to increase occupancy and better utilize GPU resources.
