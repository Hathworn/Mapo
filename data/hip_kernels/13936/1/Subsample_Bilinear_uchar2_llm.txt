```
// Consider using shared memory to cache texture reads to improve memory access efficiency
// Optimize texture fetches by ensuring aligned access patterns
// Evaluate the use of different texture hardware filtering modes for better performance
// Ensure warp divergence is minimized by checking boundary conditions efficiently
