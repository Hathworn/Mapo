```
// Precompute scaling factors outside the loop if possible
// Optimize by using shared memory for frequent data access to reduce global memory bandwidth
// Minimize the use of tex2D by combining interpolation logic
// Consider using inline functions for min/max to improve readability and maintain performance
// Evaluate the potential of vectorized operations based on uchar4 if applicable
// Avoid casting and conversions within kernel to maintain performance
