```
// Use shared memory to temporarily store and reduce accuracy values before division
// Consider using warp-level primitives to optimize parallel reduction within the block
// Ensure memory accesses are coalesced to enhance performance
// Consider reducing the use of atomic operations if they're used in other contexts
