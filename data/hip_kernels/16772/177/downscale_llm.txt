```
// Loop unrolling for better performance
// Use shared memory to minimize global memory accesses
// Consider using coalesced memory accesses for gradInput_data and gradOutput_data
// Optimize the grid and block dimensions to maximize occupancy
// Ensure the CUDA kernel is launched with enough threads to cover no_elements
