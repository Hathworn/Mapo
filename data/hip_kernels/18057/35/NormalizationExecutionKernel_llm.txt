```
// Attempt to coalesce memory accesses by ensuring data is accessed in a contiguous block
// Consider using shared memory if multiple threads access shared data to reduce redundant global memory accesses
// Ensure stride is set to optimize memory access pattern and avoid bank conflicts in memory access
// Assess impact of loop unrolling to ensure performance benefits outweigh the increased register usage
// Review occupancy and grid configuration to ensure enough threads are used for full device utilization
