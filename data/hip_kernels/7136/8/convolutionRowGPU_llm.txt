```
// Consider using shared memory to load d_Src data for better memory access efficiency
// Ensure that memory coalescing is achieved when accessing global memory
// Use more aggressive loop unrolling if the filter size is known at compile time
// Investigate using fewer registers per thread to allow more active warps
// Profile the code to check if further optimization on memory access patterns is possible
