```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory accesses
// Avoid out-of-bounds access in shared memory
// Ensure synchronization between threads in a block
// Use atomic operations to safely update shared memory
// Minimize global memory atomic operations by accumulating in shared memory
// Check bounds before global memory access to prevent errors
