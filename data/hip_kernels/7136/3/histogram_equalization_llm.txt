```
// Consider coalesced loads from global to shared memory for LUT
// Ensure shared memory usage is within limits to avoid bank conflicts
// Coalesce global memory accesses in reading img_in
// Minimize divergence by ensuring threads execute similar instructions
// Prefetch data when beneficial to hide memory latency
// Use constant memory if LUT size and access patterns are suitable
// Double-buffer shared memory to overlap computation and memory transfer
