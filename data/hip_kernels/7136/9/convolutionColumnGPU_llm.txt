```cpp
// Consider aligning shared memory access to improve memory coalescing
// Ensure shared memory use does not exceed available resources
// Optimize global memory access by ensuring coalesced memory accesses
// Evaluate loop unrolling for the convolution calculation to potentially improve performance
// Utilize registers for frequently accessed data to reduce shared memory traffic
