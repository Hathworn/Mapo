```
// Use shared memory for frequent data reuse within a block
// Initialize shared memory to minimize global memory access
// Use __syncthreads() to ensure all threads have updated shared memory
// Perform atomicAdd on shared memory to reduce global memory contention
// Write back to global memory in a coalesced manner if possible
