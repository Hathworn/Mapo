```
// Consider using warp-level operations to reduce pressure on shared memory.
// Use texture memory for input image if read-only access provides performance benefits.
// Optimize global memory access patterns by ensuring coalesced reads and writes.
// Investigate potential use of loop unrolling for initializing shared memory.
// Evaluate the use of `atomicAdd` for potential contention and explore reduction techniques.
// Consider the effect of bank conflicts in shared memory and adjust layout if needed.
// Reassess grid and block dimensions to optimize both occupancy and memory throughput.
