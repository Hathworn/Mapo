```
// Use shared memory to store filter coefficients for faster access
// Optimize global memory accesses by ensuring coalesced access patterns
// Minimize divergent branches in the kernel for better performance
// Leverage on-chip memory resources for frequently accessed data
// Unroll loops if beneficial to reduce loop overhead
