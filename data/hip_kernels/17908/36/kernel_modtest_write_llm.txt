```
// Use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.
// Initialize shared memory in parallel using all threads within a block.
// Synchronize threads with __syncthreads() to ensure shared memory initialization is complete before using it.
// Copy data from shared memory back to global memory efficiently.
