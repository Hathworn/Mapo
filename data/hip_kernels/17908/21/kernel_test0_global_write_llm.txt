```cpp
// Align data accesses to the warp boundary to improve memory coalescing
// Precompute shift count outside the loop to reduce redundant calculations
// Use bitwise operations to calculate the new ptr value to minimize instruction count
// Make use of shared memory if possible to cache data and reduce global memory accesses
// Consider loop unrolling if the loop iteration count is predictable and small
```
