```
// Consider coalesced memory access to reduce global memory transactions.
// Use shared memory to cache data if there are strided access patterns.
// Minimize warp divergence by checking conditions outside of the critical loop.
// Ensure data is aligned to memory segment boundaries for better access efficiency.
// Reduce the number of global memory writes by updating multiple values in a single transaction if possible.
