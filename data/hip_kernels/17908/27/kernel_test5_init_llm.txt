```c
// Opt: Ensure each block accesses memory within its bounds to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
// Opt: Use loop unrolling to decrease loop control overhead, improving execution efficiency.
// Opt: Apply #pragma unroll to instruct the compiler to unroll loops explicitly, enhancing performance.
// Opt: Replace repeated bit manipulation with a single mask operation to streamline the computation.
